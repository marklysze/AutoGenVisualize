    <title>Linguistic Bias in ChatGPT: Language Models Reinforce Dialect
  Discrimination</title>
    <summary>  We present a large-scale study of linguistic bias exhibited by ChatGPT
covering ten dialects of English (Standard American English, Standard British
English, and eight widely spoken non-\"standard\" varieties from around the
world). We prompted GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 with text by native speakers of
each variety and analyzed the responses via detailed linguistic feature
annotation and native speaker evaluation. We find that the models default to
\"standard\" varieties of English; based on evaluation by native speakers, we
also find that model responses to non-\"standard\" varieties consistently exhibit
a range of issues: stereotyping (19% worse than for \"standard\" varieties),
demeaning content (25% worse), lack of comprehension (9% worse), and
condescending responses (15% worse). We also find that if these models are
asked to imitate the writing style of prompts in non-\"standard\" varieties, they
produce text that exhibits lower comprehension of the input and is especially
prone to stereotyping. GPT-4 improves on GPT-3.5 in terms of comprehension,
warmth, and friendliness, but also exhibits a marked increase in stereotyping
(+18%). The results indicate that GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 can perpetuate
linguistic discrimination toward speakers of non-\"standard\" varieties.

    <title>Linguistic Bias in ChatGPT: Language Models Reinforce Dialect
  Discrimination</title>
    <summary>  We present a large-scale study of linguistic bias exhibited by ChatGPT
covering ten dialects of English (Standard American English, Standard British
English, and eight widely spoken non-\"standard\" varieties from around the
world). We prompted GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 with text by native speakers of
each variety and analyzed the responses via detailed linguistic feature
annotation and native speaker evaluation. We find that the models default to
\"standard\" varieties of English; based on evaluation by native speakers, we
also find that model responses to non-\"standard\" varieties consistently exhibit
a range of issues: stereotyping (19% worse than for \"standard\" varieties),
demeaning content (25% worse), lack of comprehension (9% worse), and
condescending responses (15% worse). We also find that if these models are
asked to imitate the writing style of prompts in non-\"standard\" varieties, they
produce text that exhibits lower comprehension of the input and is especially
prone to stereotyping. GPT-4 improves on GPT-3.5 in terms of comprehension,
warmth, and friendliness, but also exhibits a marked increase in stereotyping
(+18%). The results indicate that GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 can perpetuate
linguistic discrimination toward speakers of non-\"standard\" varieties.

**Summary of Findings:**
The paper presents a large-scale study of linguistic bias exhibited by ChatGPT, specifically focusing on ten dialects of English. The study involved prompting both GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 with text from native speakers of various dialects and analyzing the responses. Key findings include:

- The models tend to default to \"standard\" varieties of English.
- Responses to non-\"standard\" varieties showed significant issues:
  - Stereotyping (19% worse than for \"standard\" varieties)
  - Demeaning content (25% worse)
  - Lack of comprehension (9% worse)
  - Condescending responses (15% worse)
- When asked to imitate non-\"standard\" writing styles, the models produced text with lower comprehension and higher stereotyping.
- GPT-4 showed improvements over GPT-3.5 in terms of comprehension, warmth, and friendliness, but also exhibited a marked increase in stereotyping (+18%).

**Potential Applications in Software:**
1. **Bias Detection and Mitigation Tools:** The findings can inform the development of software tools that detect and mitigate linguistic bias in AI models, ensuring more equitable treatment of diverse dialects in applications like chatbots and virtual assistants.

2. **Enhanced User Interfaces:** Software can be designed to adapt responses based on the user's dialect, improving user experience and comprehension.

3. **Training Data Curation:** Insights from the study can guide the curation of training datasets to include a more balanced representation of dialects, reducing bias in future AI models.

4. **Educational Tools:** The research can be leveraged to create educational software that raises awareness about linguistic bias and promotes inclusivity in language use.

5. **Content Moderation Systems:** Applications can utilize the findings to develop content moderation systems that identify and address biased language in user-generated content.
