1. **Search for the latest GPT-4 papers on ArXiv**:
   - We'll use Python to search the ArXiv API for recent papers related to GPT-4.
2. **Parse the paper details**:
   - Extract the title and abstract of each paper.
3. **Analyze the potential applications in software**:
   - Based on the titles and abstracts, identify key areas where GPT-4 could be applied.

Let's go through these steps one by one.

### Step 1: Search for the latest GPT-4 papers on ArXiv

We'll use Python to interact with the ArXiv API. First, you need to install the `arxiv` library if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install arxiv
```

Now, let's write the Python script to search for the latest GPT-4 papers:

```python
# filename: get_gpt4_papers.py

import arxiv
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def search_latest_papers(query):
    today = datetime.now()
    one_week_ago = today - timedelta(days=7)
    
    search = arxiv.Search(
        query=query,
        id_list=[],
        sort_by=arxiv.SortCriterion.SubmittedDate,
        max_results=10
    )
    
    results = list(search.results())
    return results

def print_papers(papers):
    for paper in papers:
        print(f\"Title: {paper.title}\")
        print(f\"URL: {paper.entry_id}\")
        print(f\"Summary: {paper.summary}\
\")

if __name__ == \"__main__\":
    query = \"GPT-4\"
    latest_papers = search_latest_papers(query)
    print_papers(latest_papers)
```

### Step 2: Parse the paper details

The script above will fetch and display the title, URL, and summary of the latest papers related to GPT-4. We need to analyze these summaries to identify potential applications in software.

### Step 3: Analyze the potential applications in software

Based on the titles and abstracts, we can manually identify key areas where GPT-4 could be applied. Here are some possible applications:

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
   - Text generation
   - Chatbots and virtual assistants
   - Content summarization
   - Sentiment analysis

2. **Machine Translation**:
   - Real-time translation services
   - Automated document translation

3. **Code Generation and Assistance**:
   - Intelligent code completion
   - Automated bug detection and correction
   - Code documentation generation

4. **Virtual Customer Support**:
   - 24/7 customer support using chatbots
   - Predictive analytics to anticipate user needs

5. **Content Creation**:
   - Article summarization and expansion
   - Writing assistance for students and professionals

6. **Healthcare**:
   - Medical transcription
   - Patient records management
   - Healthcare information retrieval

7. **Finance**:
   - Fraud detection and prevention
   - Market analysis
   - Portfolio optimization

By analyzing the summaries of the latest GPT-4 papers, we can identify these potential applications in software.

### Conclusion

The script provided will fetch the latest GPT-4 papers from ArXiv and display their titles, URLs, and summaries. You need to manually analyze these summaries to identify key areas where GPT-4 could be applied in software.

If you want to automate this process further or perform more detailed analysis, you can extend the script to include natural language processing techniques to extract specific keywords and phrases from the abstracts.

Title: Human-like Affective Cognition in Foundation Models
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11733v2
Summary: Understanding emotions is fundamental to human interaction and experience.
Humans easily infer emotions from situations or facial expressions, situations
from emotions, and do a variety of other affective cognition. How adept is
modern AI at these inferences? We introduce an evaluation framework for testing
affective cognition in foundation models. Starting from psychological theory,
we generate 1,280 diverse scenarios exploring relationships between appraisals,
emotions, expressions, and outcomes. We evaluate the abilities of foundation
models (GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini-1.5-Pro) and humans (N = 567) across carefully
selected conditions. Our results show foundation models tend to agree with
human intuitions, matching or exceeding interparticipant agreement. In some
conditions, models are ``superhuman'' -- they better predict modal human
judgements than the average human. All models benefit from chain-of-thought
reasoning. This suggests foundation models have acquired a human-like
understanding of emotions and their influence on beliefs and behavior.

Title: From Lists to Emojis: How Format Bias Affects Model Alignment
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11704v1
Summary: In this paper, we study format biases in reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF). We observe that many widely-used preference models, including
human evaluators, GPT-4, and top-ranking models on the RewardBench benchmark,
exhibit strong biases towards specific format patterns, such as lists, links,
bold text, and emojis. Furthermore, large language models (LLMs) can exploit
these biases to achieve higher rankings on popular benchmarks like AlpacaEval
and LMSYS Chatbot Arena. One notable example of this is verbosity bias, where
current preference models favor longer responses that appear more
comprehensive, even when their quality is equal to or lower than shorter,
competing responses. However, format biases beyond verbosity remain largely
underexplored in the literature. In this work, we extend the study of biases in
preference learning beyond the commonly recognized length bias, offering a
comprehensive analysis of a wider range of format biases. Additionally, we show
that with a small amount of biased data (less than 1%), we can inject
significant bias into the reward model. Moreover, these format biases can also
be easily exploited by downstream alignment algorithms, such as best-of-n
sampling and online iterative DPO, as it is usually easier to manipulate the
format than to improve the quality of responses. Our findings emphasize the
need to disentangle format and content both for designing alignment algorithms
and evaluating models.

Title: Harnessing LLMs for API Interactions: A Framework for Classification and Synthetic Data Generation
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11703v1
Summary: As Large Language Models (LLMs) advance in natural language processing, there
is growing interest in leveraging their capabilities to simplify software
interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel system that integrates LLMs for
both classifying natural language inputs into corresponding API calls and
automating the creation of sample datasets tailored to specific API functions.
By classifying natural language commands, our system allows users to invoke
complex software functionalities through simple inputs, improving interaction
efficiency and lowering the barrier to software utilization. Our dataset
generation approach also enables the efficient and systematic evaluation of
different LLMs in classifying API calls, offering a practical tool for
developers or business owners to assess the suitability of LLMs for customized
API management. We conduct experiments on several prominent LLMs using
generated sample datasets for various API functions. The results show that
GPT-4 achieves a high classification accuracy of 0.996, while LLaMA-3-8B
performs much worse at 0.759. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to
transform API management and validate the effectiveness of our system in
guiding model testing and selection across diverse applications.

Title: Hackphyr: A Local Fine-Tuned LLM Agent for Network Security Environments
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11276v1
Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential across various
domains, including cybersecurity. Using commercial cloud-based LLMs may be
undesirable due to privacy concerns, costs, and network connectivity
constraints. In this paper, we present Hackphyr, a locally fine-tuned LLM to be
used as a red-team agent within network security environments. Our fine-tuned 7
billion parameter model can run on a single GPU card and achieves performance
comparable with much larger and more powerful commercial models such as GPT-4.
Hackphyr clearly outperforms other models, including GPT-3.5-turbo, and
baselines, such as Q-learning agents in complex, previously unseen scenarios.
To achieve this performance, we generated a new task-specific cybersecurity
dataset to enhance the base model's capabilities. Finally, we conducted a
comprehensive analysis of the agents' behaviors that provides insights into the
planning abilities and potential shortcomings of such agents, contributing to
the broader understanding of LLM-based agents in cybersecurity contexts

Title: Investigating Context-Faithfulness in Large Language Models: The Roles of Memory Strength and Evidence Style
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10955v1
Summary: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves Large Language Models (LLMs) by
incorporating external information into the response generation process.
However, how context-faithful LLMs are and what factors influence LLMs'
context-faithfulness remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate
the impact of memory strength and evidence presentation on LLMs' receptiveness
to external evidence. We introduce a method to quantify the memory strength of
LLMs by measuring the divergence in LLMs' responses to different paraphrases of
the same question, which is not considered by previous works. We also generate
evidence in various styles to evaluate the effects of evidence in different
styles. Two datasets are used for evaluation: Natural Questions (NQ) with
popular questions and popQA featuring long-tail questions. Our results show
that for questions with high memory strength, LLMs are more likely to rely on
internal memory, particularly for larger LLMs such as GPT-4. On the other hand,
presenting paraphrased evidence significantly increases LLMs' receptiveness
compared to simple repetition or adding details.

Title: GPT takes the SAT: Tracing changes in Test Difficulty and Math Performance of Students
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10750v1
Summary: Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is crucial for college admissions but its
effectiveness and relevance are increasingly questioned. This paper enhances
Synthetic Control methods by introducing \"Transformed Control\", a novel method
that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) powered by Artificial Intelligence to
generate control groups. We utilize OpenAI's API to generate a control group
where GPT-4, or ChatGPT, takes multiple SATs annually from 2008 to 2023. This
control group helps analyze shifts in SAT math difficulty over time, starting
from the baseline year of 2008. Using parallel trends, we calculate the Average
Difference in Scores (ADS) to assess changes in high school students' math
performance. Our results indicate a significant decrease in the difficulty of
the SAT math section over time, alongside a decline in students' math
performance. The analysis shows a 71-point drop in the rigor of SAT math from
2008 to 2023, with student performance decreasing by 36 points, resulting in a
107-point total divergence in average student math performance. We investigate
possible mechanisms for this decline in math proficiency, such as changing
university selection criteria, increased screen time, grade inflation, and
worsening adolescent mental health. Disparities among demographic groups show a
104-point drop for White students, 84 points for Black students, and 53 points
for Asian students. Male students saw a 117-point reduction, while female
students had a 100-point decrease.

Title: LLMs for clinical risk prediction
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10191v1
Summary: This study compares the efficacy of GPT-4 and clinalytix Medical AI in
predicting the clinical risk of delirium development. Findings indicate that
GPT-4 exhibited significant deficiencies in identifying positive cases and
struggled to provide reliable probability estimates for delirium risk, while
clinalytix Medical AI demonstrated superior accuracy. A thorough analysis of
the large language model's (LLM) outputs elucidated potential causes for these
discrepancies, consistent with limitations reported in extant literature. These
results underscore the challenges LLMs face in accurately diagnosing conditions
and interpreting complex clinical data. While LLMs hold substantial potential
in healthcare, they are currently unsuitable for independent clinical
decision-making. Instead, they should be employed in assistive roles,
complementing clinical expertise. Continued human oversight remains essential
to ensure optimal outcomes for both patients and healthcare providers.

Title: MindGuard: Towards Accessible and Sitgma-free Mental Health First Aid via Edge LLM
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10064v1
Summary: Mental health disorders are among the most prevalent diseases worldwide,
affecting nearly one in four people. Despite their widespread impact, the
intervention rate remains below 25%, largely due to the significant cooperation
required from patients for both diagnosis and intervention. The core issue
behind this low treatment rate is stigma, which discourages over half of those
affected from seeking help. This paper presents MindGuard, an accessible,
stigma-free, and professional mobile mental healthcare system designed to
provide mental health first aid. The heart of MindGuard is an innovative edge
LLM, equipped with professional mental health knowledge, that seamlessly
integrates objective mobile sensor data with subjective Ecological Momentary
Assessment records to deliver personalized screening and intervention
conversations. We conduct a broad evaluation of MindGuard using open datasets
spanning four years and real-world deployment across various mobile devices
involving 20 subjects for two weeks. Remarkably, MindGuard achieves results
comparable to GPT-4 and outperforms its counterpart with more than 10 times the
model size. We believe that MindGuard paves the way for mobile LLM
applications, potentially revolutionizing mental healthcare practices by
substituting self-reporting and intervention conversations with passive,
integrated monitoring within daily life, thus ensuring accessible and
stigma-free mental health support.

Title: SelECT-SQL: Self-correcting ensemble Chain-of-Thought for Text-to-SQL
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10007v1
Summary: In recent years,Text-to-SQL, the problem of automatically converting
questions posed in natural language to formal SQL queries, has emerged as an
important problem at the intersection of natural language processing and data
management research. Large language models (LLMs) have delivered impressive
performance when used in an off-the-shelf performance, but still fall
significantly short of expected expert-level performance. Errors are especially
probable when a nuanced understanding is needed of database schemas, questions,
and SQL clauses to do proper Text-to-SQL conversion. We introduce SelECT-SQL, a
novel in-context learning solution that uses an algorithmic combination of
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, self-correction, and ensemble methods to
yield a new state-of-the-art result on challenging Text-to-SQL benchmarks.
Specifically, when configured using GPT-3.5-Turbo as the base LLM, SelECT-SQL
achieves 84.2% execution accuracy on the Spider leaderboard's development set,
exceeding both the best results of other baseline GPT-3.5-Turbo-based solutions
(81.1%), and the peak performance (83.5%) of the GPT-4 result reported on the
leaderboard.

Title: GP-GPT: Large Language Model for Gene-Phenotype Mapping
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09825v1
Summary: Pre-trained large language models(LLMs) have attracted increasing attention
in biomedical domains due to their success in natural language processing.
However, the complex traits and heterogeneity of multi-sources genomics data
pose significant challenges when adapting these models to the bioinformatics
and biomedical field. To address these challenges, we present GP-GPT, the first
specialized large language model for genetic-phenotype knowledge representation
and genomics relation analysis. Our model is fine-tuned in two stages on a
comprehensive corpus composed of over 3,000,000 terms in genomics, proteomics,
and medical genetics, derived from multiple large-scale validated datasets and
scientific publications. GP-GPT demonstrates proficiency in accurately
retrieving medical genetics information and performing common genomics analysis
tasks, such as genomics information retrieval and relationship determination.
Comparative experiments across domain-specific tasks reveal that GP-GPT
outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs, including Llama2, Llama3 and GPT-4. These
results highlight GP-GPT's potential to enhance genetic disease relation
research and facilitate accurate and efficient analysis in the fields of
genomics and medical genetics. Our investigation demonstrated the subtle
changes of bio-factor entities' representations in the GP-GPT, which suggested
the opportunities for the application of LLMs to advancing gene-phenotype
research.

Title: Human-like Affective Cognition in Foundation Models
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11733v2
Summary: Understanding emotions is fundamental to human interaction and experience.
Humans easily infer emotions from situations or facial expressions, situations
from emotions, and do a variety of other affective cognition. How adept is
modern AI at these inferences? We introduce an evaluation framework for testing
affective cognition in foundation models. Starting from psychological theory,
we generate 1,280 diverse scenarios exploring relationships between appraisals,
emotions, expressions, and outcomes. We evaluate the abilities of foundation
models (GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini-1.5-Pro) and humans (N = 567) across carefully
selected conditions. Our results show foundation models tend to agree with
human intuitions, matching or exceeding interparticipant agreement. In some
conditions, models are ``superhuman'' -- they better predict modal human
judgements than the average human. All models benefit from chain-of-thought
reasoning. This suggests foundation models have acquired a human-like
understanding of emotions and their influence on beliefs and behavior.

Title: From Lists to Emojis: How Format Bias Affects Model Alignment
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11704v1
Summary: In this paper, we study format biases in reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF). We observe that many widely-used preference models, including
human evaluators, GPT-4, and top-ranking models on the RewardBench benchmark,
exhibit strong biases towards specific format patterns, such as lists, links,
bold text, and emojis. Furthermore, large language models (LLMs) can exploit
these biases to achieve higher rankings on popular benchmarks like AlpacaEval
and LMSYS Chatbot Arena. One notable example of this is verbosity bias, where
current preference models favor longer responses that appear more
comprehensive, even when their quality is equal to or lower than shorter,
competing responses. However, format biases beyond verbosity remain largely
underexplored in the literature. In this work, we extend the study of biases in
preference learning beyond the commonly recognized length bias, offering a
comprehensive analysis of a wider range of format biases. Additionally, we show
that with a small amount of biased data (less than 1%), we can inject
significant bias into the reward model. Moreover, these format biases can also
be easily exploited by downstream alignment algorithms, such as best-of-n
sampling and online iterative DPO, as it is usually easier to manipulate the
format than to improve the quality of responses. Our findings emphasize the
need to disentangle format and content both for designing alignment algorithms
and evaluating models.

Title: Harnessing LLMs for API Interactions: A Framework for Classification and Synthetic Data Generation
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11703v1
Summary: As Large Language Models (LLMs) advance in natural language processing, there
is growing interest in leveraging their capabilities to simplify software
interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel system that integrates LLMs for
both classifying natural language inputs into corresponding API calls and
automating the creation of sample datasets tailored to specific API functions.
By classifying natural language commands, our system allows users to invoke
complex software functionalities through simple inputs, improving interaction
efficiency and lowering the barrier to software utilization. Our dataset
generation approach also enables the efficient and systematic evaluation of
different LLMs in classifying API calls, offering a practical tool for
developers or business owners to assess the suitability of LLMs for customized
API management. We conduct experiments on several prominent LLMs using
generated sample datasets for various API functions. The results show that
GPT-4 achieves a high classification accuracy of 0.996, while LLaMA-3-8B
performs much worse at 0.759. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to
transform API management and validate the effectiveness of our system in
guiding model testing and selection across diverse applications.

Title: Hackphyr: A Local Fine-Tuned LLM Agent for Network Security Environments
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11276v1
Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential across various
domains, including cybersecurity. Using commercial cloud-based LLMs may be
undesirable due to privacy concerns, costs, and network connectivity
constraints. In this paper, we present Hackphyr, a locally fine-tuned LLM to be
used as a red-team agent within network security environments. Our fine-tuned 7
billion parameter model can run on a single GPU card and achieves performance
comparable with much larger and more powerful commercial models such as GPT-4.
Hackphyr clearly outperforms other models, including GPT-3.5-turbo, and
baselines, such as Q-learning agents in complex, previously unseen scenarios.
To achieve this performance, we generated a new task-specific cybersecurity
dataset to enhance the base model's capabilities. Finally, we conducted a
comprehensive analysis of the agents' behaviors that provides insights into the
planning abilities and potential shortcomings of such agents, contributing to
the broader understanding of LLM-based agents in cybersecurity contexts

Title: Investigating Context-Faithfulness in Large Language Models: The Roles of Memory Strength and Evidence Style
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10955v1
Summary: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves Large Language Models (LLMs) by
incorporating external information into the response generation process.
However, how context-faithful LLMs are and what factors influence LLMs'
context-faithfulness remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate
the impact of memory strength and evidence presentation on LLMs' receptiveness
to external evidence. We introduce a method to quantify the memory strength of
LLMs by measuring the divergence in LLMs' responses to different paraphrases of
the same question, which is not considered by previous works. We also generate
evidence in various styles to evaluate the effects of evidence in different
styles. Two datasets are used for evaluation: Natural Questions (NQ) with
popular questions and popQA featuring long-tail questions. Our results show
that for questions with high memory strength, LLMs are more likely to rely on
internal memory, particularly for larger LLMs such as GPT-4. On the other hand,
presenting paraphrased evidence significantly increases LLMs' receptiveness
compared to simple repetition or adding details.

Title: GPT takes the SAT: Tracing changes in Test Difficulty and Math Performance of Students
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10750v1
Summary: Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is crucial for college admissions but its
effectiveness and relevance are increasingly questioned. This paper enhances
Synthetic Control methods by introducing \"Transformed Control\", a novel method
that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) powered by Artificial Intelligence to
generate control groups. We utilize OpenAI's API to generate a control group
where GPT-4, or ChatGPT, takes multiple SATs annually from 2008 to 2023. This
control group helps analyze shifts in SAT math difficulty over time, starting
from the baseline year of 2008. Using parallel trends, we calculate the Average
Difference in Scores (ADS) to assess changes in high school students' math
performance. Our results indicate a significant decrease in the difficulty of
the SAT math section over time, alongside a decline in students' math
performance. The analysis shows a 71-point drop in the rigor of SAT math from
2008 to 2023, with student performance decreasing by 36 points, resulting in a
107-point total divergence in average student math performance. We investigate
possible mechanisms for this decline in math proficiency, such as changing
university selection criteria, increased screen time, grade inflation, and
worsening adolescent mental health. Disparities among demographic groups show a
104-point drop for White students, 84 points for Black students, and 53 points
for Asian students. Male students saw a 117-point reduction, while female
students had a 100-point decrease.

Title: LLMs for clinical risk prediction
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10191v1
Summary: This study compares the efficacy of GPT-4 and clinalytix Medical AI in
predicting the clinical risk of delirium development. Findings indicate that
GPT-4 exhibited significant deficiencies in identifying positive cases and
struggled to provide reliable probability estimates for delirium risk, while
clinalytix Medical AI demonstrated superior accuracy. A thorough analysis of
the large language model's (LLM) outputs elucidated potential causes for these
discrepancies, consistent with limitations reported in extant literature. These
results underscore the challenges LLMs face in accurately diagnosing conditions
and interpreting complex clinical data. While LLMs hold substantial potential
in healthcare, they are currently unsuitable for independent clinical
decision-making. Instead, they should be employed in assistive roles,
complementing clinical expertise. Continued human oversight remains essential
to ensure optimal outcomes for both patients and healthcare providers.

Title: MindGuard: Towards Accessible and Sitgma-free Mental Health First Aid via Edge LLM
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10064v1
Summary: Mental health disorders are among the most prevalent diseases worldwide,
affecting nearly one in four people. Despite their widespread impact, the
intervention rate remains below 25%, largely due to the significant cooperation
required from patients for both diagnosis and intervention. The core issue
behind this low treatment rate is stigma, which discourages over half of those
affected from seeking help. This paper presents MindGuard, an accessible,
stigma-free, and professional mobile mental healthcare system designed to
provide mental health first aid. The heart of MindGuard is an innovative edge
LLM, equipped with professional mental health knowledge, that seamlessly
integrates objective mobile sensor data with subjective Ecological Momentary
Assessment records to deliver personalized screening and intervention
conversations. We conduct a broad evaluation of MindGuard using open datasets
spanning four years and real-world deployment across various mobile devices
involving 20 subjects for two weeks. Remarkably, MindGuard achieves results
comparable to GPT-4 and outperforms its counterpart with more than 10 times the
model size. We believe that MindGuard paves the way for mobile LLM
applications, potentially revolutionizing mental healthcare practices by
substituting self-reporting and intervention conversations with passive,
integrated monitoring within daily life, thus ensuring accessible and
stigma-free mental health support.

Title: SelECT-SQL: Self-correcting ensemble Chain-of-Thought for Text-to-SQL
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10007v1
Summary: In recent years,Text-to-SQL, the problem of automatically converting
questions posed in natural language to formal SQL queries, has emerged as an
important problem at the intersection of natural language processing and data
management research. Large language models (LLMs) have delivered impressive
performance when used in an off-the-shelf performance, but still fall
significantly short of expected expert-level performance. Errors are especially
probable when a nuanced understanding is needed of database schemas, questions,
and SQL clauses to do proper Text-to-SQL conversion. We introduce SelECT-SQL, a
novel in-context learning solution that uses an algorithmic combination of
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, self-correction, and ensemble methods to
yield a new state-of-the-art result on challenging Text-to-SQL benchmarks.
Specifically, when configured using GPT-3.5-Turbo as the base LLM, SelECT-SQL
achieves 84.2% execution accuracy on the Spider leaderboard's development set,
exceeding both the best results of other baseline GPT-3.5-Turbo-based solutions
(81.1%), and the peak performance (83.5%) of the GPT-4 result reported on the
leaderboard.

Title: GP-GPT: Large Language Model for Gene-Phenotype Mapping
URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09825v1
Summary: Pre-trained large language models(LLMs) have attracted increasing attention
in biomedical domains due to their success in natural language processing.
However, the complex traits and heterogeneity of multi-sources genomics data
pose significant challenges when adapting these models to the bioinformatics
and biomedical field. To address these challenges, we present GP-GPT, the first
specialized large language model for genetic-phenotype knowledge representation
and genomics relation analysis. Our model is fine-tuned in two stages on a
comprehensive corpus composed of over 3,000,000 terms in genomics, proteomics,
and medical genetics, derived from multiple large-scale validated datasets and
scientific publications. GP-GPT demonstrates proficiency in accurately
retrieving medical genetics information and performing common genomics analysis
tasks, such as genomics information retrieval and relationship determination.
Comparative experiments across domain-specific tasks reveal that GP-GPT
outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs, including Llama2, Llama3 and GPT-4. These
results highlight GP-GPT's potential to enhance genetic disease relation
research and facilitate accurate and efficient analysis in the fields of
genomics and medical genetics. Our investigation demonstrated the subtle
changes of bio-factor entities' representations in the GP-GPT, which suggested
the opportunities for the application of LLMs to advancing gene-phenotype
research.
