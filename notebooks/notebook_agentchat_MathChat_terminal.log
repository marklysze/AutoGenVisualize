mathproxyagent (to assistant):

Let's use Python to solve a math problem.

Query requirements:
You should always use the 'print' function for the output and use fractions/radical forms instead of decimals.
You can use packages like sympy to help you.
You must follow the formats below to write your code:
```python
# your code
```

First state the key idea to solve the problem. You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:
Case 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.
Case 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.
Case 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:
1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).
2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).
3. Wait for me to give the results.
4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.

After all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \boxed{}.

Problem:
Find all $x$ that satisfy the inequality $(2x+10)(x+3)<(3x+9)(x+8)$. Express your answer in interval notation.

assistant (to mathproxyagent):

To solve the inequality \((2x+10)(x+3)<(3x+9)(x+8)\), we can first expand both sides and then rearrange the inequality to isolate all terms on one side.

### Step 1: Expand both sides of the inequality.
1. Left side: \((2x + 10)(x + 3) = 2x^2 + 6x + 10x + 30 = 2x^2 + 16x + 30\)
2. Right side: \((3x + 9)(x + 8) = 3x^2 + 24x + 9x + 72 = 3x^2 + 33x + 72\)

### Step 2: Rearrange the inequality.
The inequality becomes:
\[
2x^2 + 16x + 30 < 3x^2 + 33x + 72
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
0 < 3x^2 + 33x + 72 - 2x^2 - 16x - 30
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
0 < x^2 + 17x + 42
\]
or equivalently:
\[
x^2 + 17x + 42 > 0
\]

### Step 3: Factor the quadratic if possible.
To factor \(x^2 + 17x + 42\):
\[
x^2 + 17x + 42 = (x + 3)(x + 14)
\]

### Step 4: Determine the roots.
The roots of \(x^2 + 17x + 42 = 0\) are:
\[
x + 3 = 0 \implies x = -3
\]
\[
x + 14 = 0 \implies x = -14
\]

### Step 5: Test intervals to determine where the inequality \( (x + 3)(x + 14) > 0 \) holds.
The critical points split the number line into intervals:
1. \( (-\infty, -14) \)
2. \( (-14, -3) \)
3. \( (-3, \infty) \)

We will test points from each interval.

1. **For \(x < -14\)** (e.g., \(x = -15\)):
   \((x + 3)(x + 14) = (-15 + 3)(-15 + 14) = (-12)(-1) > 0\)

2. **For \(-14 < x < -3\)** (e.g., \(x = -10\)):
   \((x + 3)(x + 14) = (-10 + 3)(-10 + 14) = (-7)(4) < 0\)

3. **For \(x > -3\)** (e.g., \(x = 0\)):
   \((x + 3)(x + 14) = (0 + 3)(0 + 14) = (3)(14) > 0\)

### Step 6: Write the solution in interval notation.
The solution where the inequality \( (x + 3)(x + 14) > 0 \) holds is:
- \( (-\infty, -14) \)
- \( (-3, \infty) \)

Thus, the final answer in interval notation is:
\[
\boxed{(-\infty, -14) \cup (-3, \infty)}
\]
