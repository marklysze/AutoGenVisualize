KhudaBukhsh | &#160;&#160;This paper makes three key contributions. First, via a substantial corpus of&#10;51,278 interview questions sourced from 888 YouTube videos of mock interviews&#10;of Indian civil service candidates, we demonstrate stark gender bias in the&#10;broad nature of questions asked to male and female candidates. Second, our&#10;experiments with large language models show a strong presence of gender bias in&#10;explanations provided by the LLMs on the gender inference task.

However, current methods often require hundreds to&#10;thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high&#45;dimensional visual&#10;observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual&#10;representations are predominantly either pretrained on out&#45;of&#45;domain data or&#10;trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present&#10;DynaMo, a new in&#45;domain, self&#45;supervised method for learning visual&#10;representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a&#10;latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of&#10;image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without&#10;augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.&#10;Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out&#45;of&#45;domain data such as Internet&#10;datasets or cross&#45;embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real&#10;environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly&#10;improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self&#45;supervised&#10;learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo&#10;hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,&#10;and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and&#10;measure its impact on downstream policy performance.

Qwen2&#45;VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,&#10;which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions&#10;into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to&#10;generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning&#10;with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary&#10;Position Embedding (M&#45;RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional&#10;information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for&#10;processing both images and videos, enhancing the model&#39;s visual perception&#10;capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2&#45;VL&#10;investigates the scaling laws for large vision&#45;language models (LVLMs). By&#10;scaling both the model size&#45;with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters&#45;and the&#10;amount of training data, the Qwen2&#45;VL Series achieves highly competitive&#10;performance. Notably, the Qwen2&#45;VL&#45;72B model achieves results comparable to&#10;leading models such as GPT&#45;4o and Claude3.5&#45;Sonnet across various multimodal&#10;benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models.

BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses&#10;and 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance&#10;of deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to&#10;integrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and&#10;performance. However, widely&#45;used C++&#45;based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,&#10;g$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries&#10;like PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of&#10;debugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we&#10;introduce an eager&#45;mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,&#10;providing PyTorch&#45;compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach&#10;includes GPU&#45;accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for&#10;2nd&#45;order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear&#10;solvers. Our eager&#45;mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency,&#10;achieving an average speedup of 18.5$times$, 22$times$, and 23$times$&#10;compared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12190v1) |&#10;| Massively Multi&#45;Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context | Felix B Mueller, Julian Tanke, Juergen Gall | &#160;&#160;Forecasting long&#45;term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of&#10;human behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input&#10;sequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby&#10;people can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene&#45;aware social&#10;transformer model (SAST) to forecast long&#45;term (10s) human motion motion.&#10;Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely&#10;varying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal&#10;convolutional encoder&#45;decoder architecture with a Transformer&#45;based bottleneck&#10;that allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model&#10;the conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We&#10;benchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to&#10;16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously.

Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon | &#160;&#160;Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a&#10;perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from&#10;fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($mu$&#45;distortion) to late&#45;time&#10;baryonic feedback processes (y&#45;distortion). While the y&#45;distortion can be&#10;detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the&#10;$Lambda$CDM&#45;predicted $mu$&#45;distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude&#10;smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a&#10;serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $mu$&#10;arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the&#10;primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k approx 1&#45;10^{4}$ Mpc$^{&#45;1}$. Here,&#10;we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly&#10;detecting $mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but&#10;with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we&#10;optimize the instrument&#39;s configuration to target $mu$ while robustly&#10;marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike&#10;Fourier&#45;transform&#45;spectrometer&#45;based designs, the specific bands and their&#10;individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing&#10;significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the&#10;$Lambda$CDM&#45;predicted $mu$&#45;distortion at $approx 5sigma$ (10$sigma$)&#10;assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission&#10;duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized&#10;configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1&#45;2000 GHz with degree&#45;scale angular&#10;resolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally&#10;measure the y&#45;distortion at sub&#45;percent precision and its relativistic&#10;correction at percent&#45;level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total&#10;thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12188v1) |&#10;| Exoplanet accretion monitoring spectroscopic survey (ENTROPY) I.&#10; &#160;Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary&#45;mass&#10; &#160;object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C.

Detection of emission lines from&#10;accreting gas giants facilitate detailed investigations into this process. This&#10;work presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known&#10;young, planetary&#45;mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf&#10;2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7&#45;21 Mj and age 5&#45;45 Myr, located at 45+&#45;2&#10;pc. We obtained the first high&#45;resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target&#10;with VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near&#45;UV to visible wavelengths (3200&#45;6800&#10;AA). We report resolved H3&#45;H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.&#10;Based on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+&#45;1&#10;km/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR&#10;excess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of&#10;the parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+&#45;63 K and radius to 1.5+&#45;0.1&#10;Rj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet&#45;surface shock model&#10;implies a pre&#45;shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,&#45;40) km/s and a pre&#45;shock&#10;density of log(n0/cm^&#45;3)=14(+0,&#45;5). Pre&#45;shock velocity points to a mass of&#10;6(+8,&#45;4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary&#10;Lline&#45;Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of&#10;1.4(+2.8,&#45;0.9)x10^&#45;8 Mj/yr.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12187v1) |&#10;| Qwen2.5&#45;Coder Technical Report | Binyuan Hui, Jian Yang, Zeyu Cui, Jiaxi Yang, Dayiheng Liu, Lei Zhang, Tianyu Liu, Jiajun Zhang, Bowen Yu, Kai Dang, An Yang, Rui Men, Fei Huang, Xingzhang Ren, Xuancheng Ren, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin | &#160;&#160;In this report, we introduce the Qwen2.5&#45;Coder series, a significant upgrade&#10;from its predecessor, CodeQwen1.5. This series includes two models:&#10;Qwen2.5&#45;Coder&#45;1.5B and Qwen2.5&#45;Coder&#45;7B. As a code&#45;specific model,&#10;Qwen2.5&#45;Coder is built upon the Qwen2.5 architecture and continues pretrained&#10;on a vast corpus of over 5.5 trillion tokens. Through meticulous data cleaning,&#10;scalable synthetic data generation, and balanced data mixing, Qwen2.5&#45;Coder&#10;demonstrates impressive code generation capabilities while retaining general&#10;versatility. The model has been evaluated on a wide range of code&#45;related&#10;tasks, achieving state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art (SOTA) performance across more than 10&#10;benchmarks, including code generation, completion, reasoning, and repair,&#10;consistently outperforming larger models of the same model size. We believe&#10;that the release of the Qwen2.5&#45;Coder series will not only push the boundaries&#10;of research in code intelligence but also, through its permissive licensing,&#10;encourage broader adoption by developers in real&#45;world applications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12186v1) |&#10;| Disruption of a massive molecular cloud by a supernova in the Galactic&#10; &#160;Centre: Initial results from the ACES project | M.

Xu | &#160;&#160;The Milky Way&#39;s Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our&#10;local solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions&#10;it exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong&#10;dynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).&#10;Consequently, it is likely that there are large&#45;scale physical structures&#10;within the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we&#10;present new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array&#10;(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a&#10;multi&#45;wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the&#10;M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring&#45;like morphology. We&#10;estimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring to be 79&quot;&#10;and 154&quot;, respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre&#10;distance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $&gt; 10^{4}$ cm$^{&#45;3}$, a&#10;mass of $sim$ $10^6$ M$_odot$, and an expansion speed of $sim$ 20 km&#10;s$^{&#45;1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($&gt; 10^{51}$ erg) and&#10;momentum ($&gt; 10^7$ M$_odot$ km s$^{&#45;1}$). We discuss several possible causes&#10;for the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback&#10;and large&#45;scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the&#10;M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring is a single high&#45;energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain&#10;the observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have&#10;taken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which&#10;we now see as the M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an&#10;extreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12185v1) |&#10;| To CoT or not to CoT?

But for what kinds of&#10;tasks is this extra ``thinking&#39;&#39; really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted&#10;a quantitative meta&#45;analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own&#10;evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives&#10;strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with&#10;much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the&#10;answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the&#10;question or model&#39;s response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic&#10;operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of&#10;CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing&#10;against tool&#45;augmented LLMs. Much of CoT&#39;s gain comes from improving symbolic&#10;execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our&#10;results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance&#10;while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond&#10;prompt&#45;based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation&#10;across the whole range of LLM applications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183v1) |&#10;| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs | Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T. Chiu, Siyu Ren, Fei Yuan, Wenting Zhao, Zhiyong Wu, Alexander M. Rush | &#160;&#160;Broad textual understanding and in&#45;context learning require language models&#10;that utilize full document contexts. Due to the implementation challenges&#10;associated with directly training long&#45;context models, many methods have been&#10;proposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to&#10;differences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these&#10;approaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long&#45;context&#10;performance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a&#10;controlled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation,&#10;utilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several&#10;insights into long&#45;context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of&#10;perplexity as a general&#45;purpose performance indicator even in longer&#45;context&#10;tasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods&#10;systematically underperform across long&#45;context tasks. Finally, we confirm that&#10;exact fine&#45;tuning based methods are generally effective within the range of&#10;their extension, whereas extrapolation remains challenging.

Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate&#10;information that conflicts with real&#45;world facts, and their persuasive style&#10;can make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result,&#10;end&#45;users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with&#10;the accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all&#10;outputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore&#10;supervised finetuning on uncertainty&#45;augmented predictions as a method to&#10;develop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty.&#10;Specifically, we measure the calibration of pre&#45;trained models and then&#10;fine&#45;tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of&#10;uncertainty. Through experiments on various question&#45;answering datasets, we&#10;demonstrate that LLMs are well&#45;calibrated in assessing their predictions, and&#10;supervised finetuning based on the model&#39;s own confidence leads to&#10;well&#45;calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single&#45;claim&#10;answers.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12180v1) |&#10;| Computational Dynamical Systems | Jordan Cotler, Semon Rezchikov | &#160;&#160;We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite&#45;dimensional&#10;dynamical systems. Building off of previous work, we give definitions for what&#10;it means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine. We then&#10;show that &#39;chaotic&#39; dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and&#10;&#39;integrable&#39; dynamical systems (more generally, measure&#45;preserving systems)&#10;cannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines can&#10;be robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, we&#10;show that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable&#10;one&#45;dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and&#10;moreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt.&#10;More broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one &#39;machine&#39; to simulate&#10;another, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low&#45;complexity &#39;encoders&#39; and&#10;&#39;decoders&#39; to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system&#10;being simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical&#10;system leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity&#10;theory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12179v1) |&#10;| Poisson approximate likelihood compared to the particle filter | Yize Hao, Aaron A. Abkemeier, Edward L. Ionides | &#160;&#160;Filtering algorithms are fundamental for inference on partially observed&#10;stochastic dynamic systems, since they provide access to the likelihood&#10;function and hence enable likelihood&#45;based or Bayesian inference. A novel&#10;Poisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.&#10;(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering&#10;a fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of&#10;partially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL&#10;is the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large&#10;improvement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,&#10;based on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.&#10;(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should&#10;use PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence&#10;also reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a&#10;shortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that&#10;the comparison of log&#45;likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al. (2023) is&#10;flawed because their PAL calculations were carried out using a dataset scaled&#10;differently from the previous study. If PAL and the particle filter are applied&#10;to the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears. On simulations&#10;where the model is correctly specified, the particle filter outperforms PAL.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12173v1) |&#10;| You Only Read Once (YORO): Learning to Internalize Database Knowledge&#10; &#160;for Text&#45;to&#45;SQL | Hideo Kobayashi, Wuwei Lan, Peng Shi, Shuaichen Chang, Jiang Guo, Henghui Zhu, Zhiguo Wang, Patrick Ng | &#160;&#160;While significant progress has been made on the text&#45;to&#45;SQL task, recent&#10;solutions repeatedly encode the same database schema for every question,&#10;resulting in unnecessary high inference cost and often overlooking crucial&#10;database knowledge.

YORO significantly reduces the input&#10;token length by 66%&#45;98%. Despite its shorter inputs, our empirical results&#10;demonstrate YORO&#39;s competitive performances with traditional systems on three&#10;benchmarks as well as its significant outperformance on large databases.&#10;Furthermore, YORO excels in handling questions with challenging value&#10;retrievals such as abbreviation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12172v1) |&#10;| Ergodic properties of infinite extension of symmetric interval exchange&#10; &#160;transformations | Przemysław Berk, Frank Trujillo, Hao Wu | &#160;&#160;We prove that skew products with the cocycle given by the function&#10;$f(x)=a(x&#45;1/2)$ with $a&#10;eq 0$ are ergodic for every ergodic symmetric IET in&#10;the base, thus giving the full characterization of ergodic extensions in this&#10;family.

However,&#10;due to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across&#10;different MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In&#10;this study, we propose a novel Transformer&#45;based framework, multiPI&#45;TransBTS,&#10;which integrates multi&#45;physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.&#10;The model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi&#45;modal&#10;imaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor&#10;characteristics. The multiPI&#45;TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an&#10;Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi&#45;source, multi&#45;scale feature&#10;decoder. The encoder incorporates a multi&#45;branch architecture to separately&#10;extract modality&#45;specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module&#10;fuses information from multiple sources using channel&#45;wise and element&#45;wise&#10;attention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both&#10;common and task&#45;specific features through a Task&#45;Specific Feature Introduction&#10;(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),&#10;Tumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on&#10;the BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of&#10;multiPI&#45;TransBTS over the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methods. The model consistently&#10;achieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,&#10;highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results&#10;also indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision&#10;and recall in the ET segmentation task.

Veres, B. Betancourt Kamenetskaia, A. Galvan&#45;Gamez, M. G. Dainotti, Simone Dichiara, R. L. Becerra | &#160;&#160;Energetic GeV photons expected from the closest and the most energetic&#10;Gamma&#45;ray bursts (GRBs) provide an unique opportunity to study the&#10;very&#45;high&#45;energy emission as well as the possible correlations with lower&#10;energy bands in realistic GRB afterglow models. In the standard GRB afterglow&#10;model, the relativistic homogeneous shock is usually considered to be fully&#10;adiabatic, however, it could be partially radiative. Based on the external&#10;forward&#45;shock scenario in both stellar wind and constant&#45;density medium. We&#10;present a radiative&#45;adiabatic analytical model of the synchrotron self&#45;Compton&#10;(SSC) and synchrotron processes considering an electron energy distribution&#10;with a power&#45;law index of 1 &lt; p &lt; 2 and 2 $&#10;eq$ p. We show that the SSC&#10;scenario plays a relevant role in the radiative parameter $epsilon$, leading&#10;to a prolonged evolution during the slow cooling regime. In a particular case,&#10;we derive the Fermi/LAT light curves together with the photons with energies&#10;$geq$ 100 MeV in a sample of nine bursts from the second Fermi/LAT GRB catalog&#10;that exhibited temporal and spectral indices with $geq$ 1.5 and $approx$ 2,&#10;respectively. These events can hardly be described with closure relations of&#10;the standard synchrotron afterglow model, and also exhibit energetic photons&#10;above the synchrotron limit. We have modeled the multi&#45;wavelength observations&#10;of our sample to constrain the microphysical parameters, the circumburst&#10;density, the bulk Lorentz factor and the mechanism responsible for explaining&#10;the energetic GeV photons.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12166v1) |&#10;| Blind Deconvolution on Graphs: Exact and Stable Recovery | Chang Ye, Gonzalo Mateos | &#160;&#160;We study a blind deconvolution problem on graphs, which arises in the context&#10;of localizing a few sources that diffuse over networks. While the observations&#10;are bilinear functions of the unknown graph filter coefficients and sparse&#10;input signals, a mild requirement on invertibility of the diffusion filter&#10;enables an efficient convex relaxation leading to a linear programming&#10;formulation that can be tackled with off&#45;the&#45;shelf solvers. Under the&#10;Bernoulli&#45;Gaussian model for the inputs, we derive sufficient exact recovery&#10;conditions in the noise&#45;free setting. A stable recovery result is then&#10;established, ensuring the estimation error remains manageable even when the&#10;observations are corrupted by a small amount of noise. Numerical tests with&#10;synthetic and real&#45;world network data illustrate the merits of the proposed&#10;algorithm, its robustness to noise as well as the benefits of leveraging&#10;multiple signals to aid the (blind) localization of sources of diffusion. At a&#10;fundamental level, the results presented here broaden the scope of classical&#10;blind deconvolution of (spatio&#45;)temporal signals to irregular graph domains.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12164v1) |&#10;| Generalized compression and compressive search of large datasets | Morgan E. Prior, Thomas Howard III, Emily Light, Najib Ishaq, Noah M. Daniels | &#160;&#160;The Big Data explosion has necessitated the development of search algorithms&#10;that scale sub&#45;linearly in time and memory.&#10; &#160;While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently,&#10;few algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain&#45;specific.&#10; &#160;We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to&#10;perform $k$&#45;NN and $&#13;ho$&#45;NN search on compressed data while only decompressing&#10;a small, relevant, portion of the data.&#10; &#160;panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low&#45;dimensional&#10;structure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.&#10; &#160;panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between&#10;two points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in&#10;terms of the other.&#10; &#160;This property holds for many widely&#45;used distance functions, e.g. string edit&#10;distances (Levenshtein, Needleman&#45;Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures&#10;(Jaccard, Dice, etc.).&#10; &#160;We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic,&#10;and set data.&#10; &#160;We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the&#10;compressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.&#10; &#160;panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering&#10;sub&#45;linear time performance for $k$&#45;NN and $&#13;ho$&#45;NN search.&#10; &#160;We conclude that panCAKES is an efficient, general&#45;purpose algorithm for&#10;exact compressive search on large datasets that obey the manifold hypothesis.&#10; &#160;We provide an open&#45;source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming&#10;language.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12161v1) |&#10;| WeHelp: A Shared Autonomy System for Wheelchair Users | Abulikemu Abuduweili, Alice Wu, Tianhao Wei, Weiye Zhao | &#160;&#160;There is a large population of wheelchair users. Most of the wheelchair users&#10;need help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs&#10;are not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this&#10;project, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair&#10;users. A robot with a WeHelp system has three modes, following mode, remote&#10;control mode and tele&#45;operation mode. In the following mode, the robot follows&#10;the wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can&#10;ask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the&#10;wheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech&#10;recognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode.&#10;In the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy&#10;stick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs,&#10;such as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high&#10;shelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant&#10;takes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks&#10;for their needs. Our evaluation shows that the pipeline is useful and practical&#10;for wheelchair users.

These IFSs&#10;exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are&#10;topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the&#10;Blonder&#45;Tinkham&#45;Klapwijk formalism and considering normal&#45;$d$&#45;wave&#10;superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients&#10;including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and&#10;examine the validation of Widemann&#45;Franz law in the presence of both voltage&#10;and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of&#10;$d$&#45;wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the&#10;normal&#45;superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric&#10;response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in&#10;Seebeck coefficient ($sim 200,mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($sim 3.5$) due to the&#10;generation of the IFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for&#10;device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by&#10;computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice&#45;regularized&#10;version of our continuum model.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12157v1) |&#10;| JEAN: Joint Expression and Audio&#45;guided NeRF&#45;based Talking Face&#10; &#160;Generation | Sai Tanmay Reddy Chakkera, Aggelina Chatziagapi, Dimitris Samaras | &#160;&#160;We introduce a novel method for joint expression and audio&#45;guided talking&#10;face generation. Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker&#10;identity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these&#10;challenges, we propose a NeRF&#45;based network. Since we train our network on&#10;monocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn&#10;disentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio&#10;features in a self&#45;supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects.&#10;By incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned&#10;audio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle&#10;motion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer&#45;based architecture&#10;that learns expression features, capturing long&#45;range facial expressions and&#10;disentangling them from the speech&#45;specific mouth movements. Through&#10;quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can&#10;synthesize high&#45;fidelity talking face videos, achieving state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art facial&#10;expression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12156v1) |&#10;| Autopet III challenge: Incorporating anatomical knowledge into nnUNet&#10; &#160;for lesion segmentation in PET/CT | Hamza Kalisch, Fabian Hörst, Ken Herrmann, Jens Kleesiek, Constantin Seibold | &#160;&#160;Lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging is essential for precise tumor&#10;characterization, which supports personalized treatment planning and enhances&#10;diagnostic precision in oncology. However, accurate manual segmentation of&#10;lesions is time&#45;consuming and prone to inter&#45;observer variability. Given the&#10;rising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods,&#10;particularly deep&#45;learning&#45;based approaches, have become increasingly more&#10;relevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation&#10;of tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting,&#10;addressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable&#10;solutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET&#10;challenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers&#10;(FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers. To this extent, we developed a&#10;classifier that identifies the tracer of the given PET/CT based on the Maximum&#10;Intensity Projection of the PET scan. We trained two individual&#10;nnUNet&#45;ensembles for each tracer where anatomical labels are included as a&#10;multi&#45;label task to enhance the model&#39;s performance. Our final submission&#10;achieves cross&#45;validation Dice scores of 76.90% and 61.33% for the publicly&#10;available FDG and PSMA datasets, respectively.

However, a&#10;robot&#39;s ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if&#10;naively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach&#45;avoid&#10;dynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a&#10;safety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human&#39;s behavior&#10;as goal&#45;driven but conditioned on the robot&#39;s plan, enabling us to capture&#10;influence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical&#10;and belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in&#10;human behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE&#10;(Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high&#45;dimensional&#10;(39&#45;D) simulated human&#45;robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline&#10;game&#45;theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust&#10;baseline that treats the human as a worst&#45;case adversary, a safety controller&#10;that does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy&#45;function&#45;based&#10;safety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage&#10;the influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing&#10;the robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate&#10;during task execution.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12153v1) |&#10;| Decoding Style: Efficient Fine&#45;Tuning of LLMs for Image&#45;Guided Outfit&#10; &#160;Recommendation with Preference | Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan | &#160;&#160;Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding&#10;both fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper&#10;presents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large&#10;language models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their &quot;black box&quot; and static&#10;nature through fine&#45;tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item&#10;visual&#45;textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a&#10;Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style&#10;and color characteristics from human&#45;curated fashion images, forming the basis&#10;for personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine&#45;tuned on the&#10;open&#45;source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability&#10;to recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative&#10;examples is employed to enhance the LLM&#39;s decision&#45;making process. This creates&#10;a self&#45;enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in&#10;line with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore&#10;dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill&#45;in&#45;the&#45;blank,&#10;and complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework&#39;s&#10;ability to generate stylish, trend&#45;aligned outfit suggestions, continuously&#10;improving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our&#10;proposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more&#10;cohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the&#10;proposed framework&#39;s potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate&#10;suggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit&#10;generation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12150v1) |&#10;| Mechanical Wannier&#45;Stark Ladder of Diamond Spin&#45;Mechanical Lamb Wave&#10; &#160;Resonators | Philip Andrango, Hailin Wang | &#160;&#160;We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier&#45;Stark ladders of&#10;diamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with&#10;ultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin&#10;properties. Three nearest&#45;neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric&#10;configurations and a large range of coupling rates have been explored for the&#10;realization of Wannier&#45;Stark ladders of LWRs, potentially enabling long&#45;range&#10;connectivity between spin qubits through their interactions with mechanical&#10;vibrations. Additional analysis on the effects of disorder indicates that the&#10;proposed Wannier&#45;Stark ladder can be robust against realistic experimental&#10;imperfections. The development of mechanical quantum networks of spin qubits&#10;with long&#45;range connectivity can open the door to the implementation of newly&#10;developed quantum low&#45;density parity&#45;check codes in solid&#45;state systems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12149v1) |&#10;| MAgICoRe: Multi&#45;Agent, Iterative, Coarse&#45;to&#45;Fine Refinement for&#10; &#160;Reasoning | Justin Chih&#45;Yao Chen, Archiki Prasad, Swarnadeep Saha, Elias Stengel&#45;Eskin, Mohit Bansal | &#160;&#160;Large Language Models&#39; (LLM) reasoning can be improved using test&#45;time&#10;aggregation strategies, i.e., generating multiple samples and voting among&#10;generated samples. While these improve performance, they often reach a&#10;saturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM&#45;generated&#10;feedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key&#10;challenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can&#10;over&#45;correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and&#10;address errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self&#45;correct and struggle to&#10;identify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding&#10;how many iterations of refinement are needed is non&#45;trivial, and stopping too&#10;soon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose&#10;MAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty&#10;as easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse&#45;grained aggregation and hard&#10;ones with fine&#45;grained and iterative multi&#45;agent refinement. To improve error&#10;localization, we incorporate external step&#45;wise reward model (RM) scores.&#10;Moreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi&#45;agent loop with&#10;three agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on&#10;step&#45;wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure&#10;sufficient refinement, we re&#45;evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating&#10;further rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama&#45;3&#45;8B and GPT&#45;3.5&#10;and show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of&#10;MAgICoRe beats Self&#45;Consistency by 3.4%, Best&#45;of&#45;k by 3.2%, and Self&#45;Refine by&#10;4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with&#10;baselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our&#10;ablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe&#39;s RMs and multi&#45;agent&#10;communication.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147v1) |&#10;| Lempel&#45;Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka | &#160;&#160;Lempel&#45;Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string&#10;processing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into&#10;blocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence&#10;of a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another&#10;occurrence earlier in $T$. Due to numerous applications, LZ77 factorization is&#10;one of the most studied problems on strings. In the 47 years since its&#10;inception, several algorithms were developed for different models of&#10;computation, including parallel, GPU, external&#45;memory, and quantum. Remarkably,&#10;however, the complexity of the most basic variant is still not settled: All&#10;existing algorithms in the RAM model run in $Omega(n)$ time, which is a&#10;$Theta(&#10;og n)$ factor away from the lower bound of $Omega(n/&#10;og n)$&#10;(following from the necessity to read the input, which takes $Theta(n/&#10;og n)$&#10;space for $Tin{0,1}^{n}$).&#10; &#160;We present the first $o(n)$&#45;time algorithm for LZ77 factorization, breaking&#10;the linear&#45;time barrier present for nearly 50 years. For $Tin{0,1}^{n}$, our&#10;algorithm runs in $mathcal{O}(n/sqrt{&#10;og n})=o(n)$ time and uses the optimal&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og n)$ working space. Our algorithm generalizes to&#10;$Sigma=[0..sigma)$, where $sigma=n^{mathcal{O}(1)}$. The runtime and&#10;working space then become $mathcal{O}((n&#10;ogsigma)/sqrt{&#10;og n})$ and&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og_{sigma} n)$. To obtain our algorithm, we prove a more&#10;general result: For any constant $epsilonin(0,1)$ and $Tin[0..sigma)^{n}$,&#10;in $mathcal{O}((n&#10;ogsigma)/sqrt{&#10;og n})$ time and using&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og_{sigma}n)$ space, we can construct an&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og_{sigma}n)$&#45;size index that, given any $P=T[j..j+ell)$&#10;(represented as $(j,ell)$), computes the leftmost occurrence of $P$ in $T$ in&#10;$mathcal{O}(&#10;og^{epsilon}n)$ time. In other words, we solve the&#10;indexing/online variant of the LZ77 problem.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12146v1) |&#10;| Experimental Evidence That Conversational Artificial Intelligence Can&#10; &#160;Steer Consumer Behavior Without Detection | Tobias Werner, Ivan Soraperra, Emilio Calvano, David C.

In this&#10;report, we introduce Takin AudioLLM, a series of techniques and models, mainly&#10;including Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, specifically designed for&#10;audiobook production. These models are capable of zero&#45;shot speech production,&#10;generating high&#45;quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human&#10;speech and facilitating individuals to customize the speech content according&#10;to their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec&#10;language model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a&#10;multi&#45;task training framework, capable of generating high&#45;fidelity natural&#10;speech in a zero&#45;shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and&#10;timbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while&#10;advocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its&#10;naturalness and expressiveness.

To better pursue the scaling power of MoE, we introduce GRIN&#10;(GRadient&#45;INformed MoE training), which incorporates sparse gradient estimation&#10;for expert routing and configures model parallelism to avoid token dropping.&#10;Applying GRIN to autoregressive language modeling, we develop a top&#45;2&#10;16$times$3.8B MoE model. Our model, with only 6.6B activated parameters,&#10;outperforms a 7B dense model and matches the performance of a 14B dense model&#10;trained on the same data. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks&#10;demonstrate the potential of GRIN to significantly enhance MoE efficacy,&#10;achieving 79.4 on MMLU, 83.7 on HellaSwag, 74.4 on HumanEval, and 58.9 on MATH.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12136v1) |&#10;| BERT&#45;VBD: Vietnamese Multi&#45;Document Summarization Framework | Tuan&#45;Cuong Vuong, Trang Mai Xuan, Thien Van Luong | &#160;&#160;In tackling the challenge of Multi&#45;Document Summarization (MDS), numerous&#10;methods have been proposed, spanning both extractive and abstractive&#10;summarization techniques. However, each approach has its own limitations,&#10;making it less effective to rely solely on either one. An emerging and&#10;promising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractive&#10;summarization methods. Despite the plethora of studies in this domain, research&#10;on the combined methodology remains scarce, particularly in the context of&#10;Vietnamese language processing. This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDS&#10;framework leveraging a two&#45;component pipeline architecture that integrates&#10;extractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs an&#10;extractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This is&#10;achieved by a modification of the pre&#45;trained BERT network, which derives&#10;semantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet network&#10;structures. The second component utilizes the VBD&#45;LLaMA2&#45;7B&#45;50b model for&#10;abstractive summarization, ultimately generating the final summary document.&#10;Our proposed framework demonstrates a positive performance, attaining ROUGE&#45;2&#10;scores of 39.6% on the VN&#45;MDS dataset and outperforming the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art&#10;baselines.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12134v1) |&#10;| Einstein&#45;dilaton&#45;four&#45;Maxwell Holographic Anisotropic Models | Irina Ya. Aref&#39;eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov | &#160;&#160;In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the&#10;five&#45;dimensional Einstein&#45;dilaton&#45;Maxwell models has played a crucial role.&#10;Typically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while&#10;additional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A&#10;more general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field&#10;represents spatial longitudinal&#45;transverse anisotropy, while the third and&#10;fourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We&#10;consider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero&#10;temperature and five functions at non&#45;zero temperature. Maxwell field related&#10;to the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,&#10;whereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.&#10;We demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of&#10;the seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations &#45;&#45; either the&#10;dilaton or the vector potential equation &#45;&#45; follows from the Einstein equations&#10;and the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi&#10;identity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress&#45;energy&#10;tensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is&#10;provided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to&#10;three Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis&#10;shows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein&#10;equations and the equation for the vector potential&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12131v1) |&#10;| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components&#10; &#160;for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco&#45;Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram | &#160;&#160;Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data&#10;together with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal&#10;components used. It is therefore important to determine the number of&#10;significant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a&#10;variational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for&#10;estimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of&#10;samples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This&#10;eliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of&#10;principal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.&#10;This framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows&#10;and columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),&#10;and with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data&#10;with arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as&#10;cultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our&#10;method on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may&#10;underestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the&#10;synthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical&#10;dataset. These results suggest that it is broadly applicable across the life&#10;sciences.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12129v1) |&#10;| Linguini: A benchmark for language&#45;agnostic linguistic reasoning | Eduardo Sánchez, Belen Alastruey, Christophe Ropers, Pontus Stenetorp, Mikel Artetxe, Marta R. Costa&#45;jussà | &#160;&#160;We propose a new benchmark to measure a language model&#39;s linguistic reasoning&#10;skills without relying on pre&#45;existing language&#45;specific knowledge. The test&#10;covers 894 questions grouped in 160 problems across 75 (mostly) extremely&#10;low&#45;resource languages, extracted from the International Linguistic Olympiad&#10;corpus. To attain high accuracy on this benchmark, models don&#39;t need previous&#10;knowledge of the tested language, as all the information needed to solve the&#10;linguistic puzzle is presented in the context. We find that, while all analyzed&#10;models rank below 25% accuracy, there is a significant gap between open and&#10;closed models, with the best&#45;performing proprietary model at 24.05% and the&#10;best&#45;performing open model at 8.84%.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12126v1) |&#10;| From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the&#10; &#160;primordial black hole reheating scenario | Guillem Domènech, Jan Tränkle | &#160;&#160;We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs&#10;originate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight&#10;PBHs with masses $M&#10;esssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat&#10;it via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate&#10;whether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH&#10;reheating contains information about the pre&#45;PBH&#45;dominated stage, namely the&#10;initial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer&#10;functions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and&#10;isocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation&#10;of state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH&#10;dominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the&#10;spectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive&#10;to $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density&#10;fluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance&#10;as a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)&#10;observations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the&#10;initial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we&#10;find that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several&#10;future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas,&#10;especially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any&#10;early matter&#45;dominated universe scenario.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12125v1) |&#10;| Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules | Anqi Zhang, Wilson S. Geisler | &#160;&#160;Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We&#10;investigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented&#10;displays having well&#45;separated potential target&#45;object locations. Performance&#10;was compared with the Bayesian&#45;optimal decision process under the assumption&#10;that the information from the different potential target locations is&#10;statistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than&#10;optimal, despite humans&#39; substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the&#10;implausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show&#10;that three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical&#10;results. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near&#10;optimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the&#10;central potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise&#10;causes search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These&#10;findings have far&#45;reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks&#10;and other identification tasks in humans and other animals.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12124v1) |&#10;| Far&#45;from&#45;equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann&#10; &#160;approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows&#10; &#160;$v_n$ | Vincenzo Nugara, Vincenzo Greco, Salvatore Plumari | &#160;&#160;We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal&#10;system in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution&#10;function and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system&#10;sizes $R$ and interaction strength $eta/s$ and identify universality classes&#10;based upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each&#10;of this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $hat&#10;gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results&#10;highlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum&#10;moments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to&#10;a 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of&#10;different sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a&#10;similar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse&#10;flow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system&#10;size and $eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and&#10;their response functions, along with the impact of the $eta/s$ and the system&#10;transverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in&#10;momentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow&#10;$v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of&#10;large opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems&#10;evolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play&#10;in this process.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12123v1) |&#10;| Qwen2.5&#45;Math Technical Report: Toward Mathematical Expert Model via&#10; &#160;Self&#45;Improvement | An Yang, Beichen Zhang, Binyuan Hui, Bofei Gao, Bowen Yu, Chengpeng Li, Dayiheng Liu, Jianhong Tu, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin, Keming Lu, Mingfeng Xue, Runji Lin, Tianyu Liu, Xingzhang Ren, Zhenru Zhang | &#160;&#160;In this report, we present a series of math&#45;specific large language models:&#10;Qwen2.5&#45;Math and Qwen2.5&#45;Math&#45;Instruct&#45;1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the&#10;Qwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self&#45;improvement&#10;throughout the entire pipeline, from pre&#45;training and post&#45;training to&#10;inference: (1) During the pre&#45;training phase, Qwen2&#45;Math&#45;Instruct is utilized&#10;to generate large&#45;scale, high&#45;quality mathematical data. (2) In the&#10;post&#45;training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive&#10;sampling from Qwen2&#45;Math&#45;Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative&#10;evolution of data in supervised fine&#45;tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model,&#10;it&#39;s possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the&#10;next round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the&#10;ultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5&#45;Math&#45;Instruct.&#10;(3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling,&#10;optimizing the model&#39;s performance.&#10; &#160;Qwen2.5&#45;Math&#45;Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced&#10;mathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain&#45;of&#45;Thought (CoT) and&#10;Tool&#45;Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics&#10;datasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and&#10;AIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math&#10;competition problems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12122v1) |&#10;| Computing the $mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two&#45;Dimensional&#10; &#160;Strongly&#45;Correlated Systems | Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn | &#160;&#160;We show that the two&#45;dimensional $mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time&#45;reversal&#10;invariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary&#45;condition&#10;dependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non&#45;interacting and&#10;strongly&#45;correlated insulators. By introducing a family of quasi&#45;single&#10;particle states associated to the many&#45;body ground state of an insulator, we&#10;show that the $mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant can be expressed as the integral of a&#10;certain Berry connection over half the space of boundary conditions, providing&#10;an alternative expression to the formulations that appear in [Lee et al., Phys.&#10;Rev. Lett. $textbf{100}$, 186807 (2008)]. We show the equivalence of the&#10;different many&#45;body formulations of the invariant, and show how they reduce to&#10;known band&#45;theoretic results for Slater determinant ground states. Finally, we&#10;apply our results to analytically calculate the invariant for the Kane&#45;Mele&#10;model with nonlocal (orbital) Hatsugai&#45;Kohmoto (HK) interactions. This&#10;rigorously establishes the topological nontriviality of the Kane&#45;Mele model&#10;with HK interactions, and represents one of the few exact calculations of the&#10;$mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a strongly&#45;interacting system.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12120v1) |&#10;| Weak Lensing analysis of Abell 2390 using short exposures | A. Dutta, J. R. Peterson, T. Rose, M. Cianfaglione, A. Bonafede, G. Li, G. Sembroski | &#160;&#160;We present a weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 2390 at z =&#10;0.23 using second moment shape measurements made in 411 short 60s exposures.&#10;The exposures are obtained in three broadband photometric filters (g, r, i)&#10;using WIYN&#45;ODI. Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a&#10;moment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching&#10;algorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The&#10;measurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight&#10;to obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim&#10;simulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find&#10;the mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We&#10;also find the E&#45;Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic&#10;structures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical&#10;and X&#45;Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to&#10;map large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of&#10;the cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the&#10;peaks are similar to X&#45;Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster&#10;and show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12119v1) |&#10;| Low Frame&#45;rate Speech Codec: a Codec Designed for Fast High&#45;quality&#10; &#160;Speech LLM Training and Inference | Edresson Casanova, Ryan Langman, Paarth Neekhara, Shehzeen Hussain, Jason Li, Subhankar Ghosh, Ante Jukić, Sang&#45;gil Lee | &#160;&#160;Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing&#10;through audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the&#10;application of language modeling techniques to audio data. However, audio&#10;codecs often operate at high frame rates, resulting in slow training and&#10;inference, especially for autoregressive models. To address this challenge, we&#10;present the Low Frame&#45;rate Speech Codec (LFSC): a neural audio codec that&#10;leverages finite scalar quantization and adversarial training with large speech&#10;language models to achieve high&#45;quality audio compression with a 1.89 kbps&#10;bitrate and 21.5 frames per second. We demonstrate that our novel codec can&#10;make the inference of LLM&#45;based text&#45;to&#45;speech models around three times faster&#10;while improving intelligibility and producing quality comparable to previous&#10;models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12117v1) |&#10;| Stronger Baseline Models &#45;&#45; A Key Requirement for Aligning Machine&#10; &#160;Learning Research with Clinical Utility | Nathan Wolfrath, Joel Wolfrath, Hengrui Hu, Anjishnu Banerjee, Anai N. Kothari | &#160;&#160;Machine Learning (ML) research has increased substantially in recent years,&#10;due to the success of predictive modeling across diverse application domains.&#10;However, well&#45;known barriers exist when attempting to deploy ML models in&#10;high&#45;stakes, clinical settings, including lack of model transparency (or the&#10;inability to audit the inference process), large training data requirements&#10;with siloed data sources, and complicated metrics for measuring model utility.&#10;In this work, we show empirically that including stronger baseline models in&#10;healthcare ML evaluations has important downstream effects that aid&#10;practitioners in addressing these challenges. Through a series of case studies,&#10;we find that the common practice of omitting baselines or comparing against a&#10;weak baseline model (e.g. a linear model with no optimization) obscures the&#10;value of ML methods proposed in the research literature. Using these insights,&#10;we propose some best practices that will enable practitioners to more&#10;effectively study and deploy ML models in clinical settings.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12116v1) |&#10;| Revisiting Dark Photon Constraints from CMB Spectral Distortions | Jens Chluba, Bryce Cyr, Matthew C. Johnson | &#160;&#160;Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide&#10;stringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post&#45;BBN (Big&#10;Bang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models&#10;with COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.&#10;Here, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark&#10;photon conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous&#10;works only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the&#10;change to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon&#10;distortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the&#10;distortion has an opposite sign and a $simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We&#10;furthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover&#10;the redshift range $simeq 2times 10^6&#45;4times 10^7$ between the $mu$&#45;era and&#10;the end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints&#10;for dark photon masses in the range $10^{&#45;4},{&#13;m eV}&#10;esssim m_{&#13;m&#10;dp}&#10;esssim 10^{&#45;3},{&#13;m eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We&#10;demonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon&#10;to dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $mu$&#45;type distortion&#10;independent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study&#10;dark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with&#10;CMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12115v1) |&#10;| Bi&#45;objective trail&#45;planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous&#10; &#160;environment | Cory M. Simon, Jeffrey Richley, Lucas Overbey, Darleen Perez&#45;Lavin | &#160;&#160;Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in&#10;resource delivery, patrolling, information&#45;gathering, agriculture, forest fire&#10;fighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and&#10;search&#45;and&#45;rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments &#45;&#45; with e.g.&#10;rough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or&#10;capturing robots &#45;&#45; should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of&#10;risks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should&#10;take the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the&#10;team&#45;level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward&#10;from visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider&#10;bi&#45;objective trail&#45;planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a&#10;hazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed&#10;graph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of&#10;survival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a&#10;robot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for&#10;the Pareto&#45;optimal robot&#45;team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team&#10;objectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive&#10;the mission. A human decision&#45;maker can then select trail plans that balance,&#10;according to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony&#10;optimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto&#45;optimal set of&#10;robot team trail plans. As a case study, we illustrate with an&#10;information&#45;gathering mission in an art museum.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12114v1) |&#10;| Pareto Data Framework: Steps Towards Resource&#45;Efficient Decision Making&#10; &#160;Using Minimum Viable Data (MVD) | Tashfain Ahmed, Josh Siegel | &#160;&#160;This paper introduces the Pareto Data Framework, an approach for identifying&#10;and selecting the Minimum Viable Data (MVD) required for enabling machine&#10;learning applications on constrained platforms such as embedded systems, mobile&#10;devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We demonstrate that strategic&#10;data reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing&#10;bandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies&#10;Minimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource&#45;constrained&#10;environments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient&#10;practices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and&#10;overprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for&#10;optimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data&#10;representation. An experimental methodology demonstrates effective acoustic&#10;data characterization after downsampling, quantization, and truncation to&#10;simulate reduced&#45;fidelity sensors and network and storage constraints; results&#10;shows that performance can be maintained up to 95% with sample rates reduced&#10;by 75% and bit depths and clip length reduced by 50% which translates into&#10;substantial cost and resource reduction. These findings have implications on&#10;the design and development of constrained systems. The paper also discusses&#10;broader implications of the framework, including the potential to democratize&#10;advanced AI technologies across IoT applications and sectors such as&#10;agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing to improve access and multiply&#10;the benefits of data&#45;driven insights.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12112v1) |&#10;| Applications of Knowledge Distillation in Remote Sensing: A Survey | Yassine Himeur, Nour Aburaed, Omar Elharrouss, Iraklis Varlamis, Shadi Atalla, Wathiq Mansoor, Hussain Al Ahmad | &#160;&#160;With the ever&#45;growing complexity of models in the field of remote sensing&#10;(RS), there is an increasing demand for solutions that balance model accuracy&#10;with computational efficiency. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a&#10;powerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,&#10;complex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in&#10;performance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and&#10;its innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer&#10;knowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact&#10;and efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application&#10;across various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and&#10;historical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are&#10;highlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational&#10;efficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical&#10;deployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of&#10;KD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the&#10;breadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case&#10;studies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,&#10;such as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review&#10;discusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical&#10;constraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive&#10;overview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS. Through this&#10;organization, the paper not only elucidates the current state of research in KD&#10;but also sets the stage for future research opportunities, thereby contributing&#10;significantly to both academic research and real&#45;world applications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12111v1) |&#10;| It depends: Varieties of defining growth dependence | Anja Janischewski, Katharina Bohnenberger, Matthias Kranke, Tobias Vogel, Riwan Driouich, Tobias Froese, Stefanie Gerold, Raphael Kaufmann, Lorenz Keyßer, Jannis Niethammer, Christopher Olk, Matthias Schmelzer, Aslı Yürük, Steffen Lange | &#160;&#160;Many socio&#45;economic systems require positive economic growth rates to&#10;function properly. Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing&#10;evidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,&#10;these growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,&#10;more and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth&#45;dependent systems&#10;and develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of&#10;&#39;growth dependence&#39; still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,&#10;which impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article&#10;proposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the&#10;concept of &#39;growth dependence&#39; across socio&#45;economic systems. We provide a&#10;general definition consisting of four components that can be specified for&#10;different empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of&#10;measurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions&#10;or properties of the system under investigation. According to our general&#10;definition, a socio&#45;economic system is growth&#45;dependent if it requires a&#10;long&#45;term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to&#10;maintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen&#10;normative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to&#10;three areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:&#10;employment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies&#10;demonstrate that whether or not a system is growth&#45;dependent hinges not only on&#10;the empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of&#10;the concept of growth dependence. Our framework enables coherent, robust and&#10;effective definitions and research questions, fostering comparability of&#10;findings across different cases and disciplines.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12109v1) |&#10;| SPRMamba: Surgical Phase Recognition for Endoscopic Submucosal&#10; &#160;Dissection with Mamba | Xiangning Zhang, Jinnan Chen, Qingwei Zhang, Chengfeng Zhou, Zhengjie Zhang, Xiaobo Li, Dahong Qian | &#160;&#160;Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive procedure&#10;initially designed for the treatment of early gastric cancer but is now widely&#10;used for various gastrointestinal lesions. Computer&#45;assisted Surgery systems&#10;have played a crucial role in improving the precision and safety of ESD&#10;procedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognition&#10;of surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesion&#10;characteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real&#45;time&#10;surgical phase recognition algorithms. Existing surgical phase recognition&#10;algorithms struggle to efficiently capture temporal contexts in video&#45;based&#10;scenarios, leading to insufficient performance. To address these issues, we&#10;propose SPRMamba, a novel Mamba&#45;based framework for ESD surgical phase&#10;recognition. SPRMamba leverages the strengths of Mamba for long&#45;term temporal&#10;modeling while introducing the Scaled Residual TranMamba block to enhance the&#10;capture of fine&#45;grained details, overcoming the limitations of traditional&#10;temporal models like Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformers.&#10;Moreover, a Temporal Sample Strategy is introduced to accelerate the&#10;processing, which is essential for real&#45;time phase recognition in clinical&#10;settings. Extensive testing on the ESD385 dataset and the cholecystectomy&#10;Cholec80 dataset demonstrates that SPRMamba surpasses existing state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art&#10;methods and exhibits greater robustness across various surgical phase&#10;recognition tasks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12108v1) |&#10;| Who&#39;s the GOAT? Sports Rankings and Data&#45;Driven Random Walks on the&#10; &#160;Symmetric Group | Gian&#45;Gabriel P. Garcia, J. Carlos Martínez Mori | &#160;&#160;Given a collection of historical sports rankings, can one tell which player&#10;is the greatest of all time (i.e., the GOAT)? In this work, we design a&#10;data&#45;driven random walk on the symmetric group to obtain a stationary&#10;distribution over player rankings, spanning across different time periods in&#10;sports history. We combine this distribution with a notion of stochastic&#10;dominance to obtain a partial order over the players. We implement our methods&#10;using publicly available data from the Association of Tennis Professionals&#10;(ATP) and the Women&#39;s Tennis Association (WTA) to find the GOATs in the&#10;respective categories.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12107v1) |&#10;| Measuring Human and AI Values based on Generative Psychometrics with&#10; &#160;Large Language Models | Haoran Ye, Yuhang Xie, Yuanyi Ren, Hanjun Fang, Xin Zhang, Guojie Song | &#160;&#160;Human values and their measurement are long&#45;standing interdisciplinary&#10;inquiry. Recent advances in AI have sparked renewed interest in this area, with&#10;large language models (LLMs) emerging as both tools and subjects of value&#10;measurement. This work introduces Generative Psychometrics for Values (GPV), an&#10;LLM&#45;based, data&#45;driven value measurement paradigm, theoretically grounded in&#10;text&#45;revealed selective perceptions. We begin by fine&#45;tuning an LLM for&#10;accurate perception&#45;level value measurement and verifying the capability of&#10;LLMs to parse texts into perceptions, forming the core of the GPV pipeline.&#10;Applying GPV to human&#45;authored blogs, we demonstrate its stability, validity,&#10;and superiority over prior psychological tools. Then, extending GPV to LLM&#10;value measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometric&#10;methodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free&#45;form&#10;outputs, enabling context&#45;specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis of&#10;measurement paradigms, indicating response biases of prior methods; and 3) an&#10;attempt to bridge LLM values and their safety, revealing the predictive power&#10;of different value systems and the impacts of various values on LLM safety.&#10;Through interdisciplinary efforts, we aim to leverage AI for next&#45;generation&#10;psychometrics and psychometrics for value&#45;aligned AI.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12106v1) |&#10;| FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated&#10; &#160;Long&#45;Tailed Learning | Xiuhua Lu, Peng Li, Xuefeng Jiang | &#160;&#160;Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy&#10;in distributed machine learning. However, datasets distributed across each&#10;client in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can&#10;be globally aggregated, they tend to be long&#45;tailed distributed, which greatly&#10;affects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated&#10;learning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it&#10;fails to address the phenomenon of class&#45;wise bias in global long&#45;tailed data.&#10;This results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting&#10;the equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a&#10;methodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,&#10;we propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the&#10;local training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred&#10;optimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art&#10;methods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long&#45;tailed&#10;distribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR&#45;10&#45;LT and&#10;CIFAR&#45;100&#45;LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of&#10;model performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long&#45;tailed&#10;distribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12105v1) |&#10;| Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error&#10; &#160;Detection | Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia | &#160;&#160;Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real&#45;world applications. Doing&#10;so requires overcoming the noise present on today&#39;s hardware. The quantum&#10;approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling&#10;up due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup&#10;over state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art classical algorithms for some problems. However,&#10;achieving better&#45;than&#45;classical performance with QAOA is believed to require&#10;fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault&#45;tolerant&#10;implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg&#39;&#39; error detection&#10;code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the&#10;algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with&#10;up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped&#45;ion quantum computer. Additionally, we&#10;propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance, and use it&#10;to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance&#10;to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our&#10;model can be used to determine necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform&#10;Goemans&#45;Williamson algorithm on future hardware. Our results demonstrate the&#10;largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially&#10;fault&#45;tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date,&#10;paving the way towards solving real&#45;world applications with quantum computers.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12104v1) |&#10;| Cyclicity Analysis of the Ornstein&#45;Uhlenbeck Process | Vivek Kaushik | &#160;&#160;In this thesis, we consider an $N$&#45;dimensional Ornstein&#45;Uhlenbeck (OU)&#10;process satisfying the linear stochastic differential equation $dmathbf x(t) =&#10;&#45; mathbf Bmathbf x(t) dt + boldsymbol Sigma d mathbf w(t).$ Here, $mathbf&#10;B$ is a fixed $N times N$ circulant friction matrix whose eigenvalues have&#10;positive real parts, $boldsymbol Sigma$ is a fixed $N times M$ matrix. We&#10;consider a signal propagation model governed by this OU process. In this model,&#10;an underlying signal propagates throughout a network consisting of $N$ linked&#10;sensors located in space. We interpret the $n$&#45;th component of the OU process&#10;as the measurement of the propagating effect made by the $n$&#45;th sensor. The&#10;matrix $mathbf B$ represents the sensor network structure: if $mathbf B$ has&#10;first row $(b_1 &#160;, &#160;dots &#160;, &#160;b_N),$ where $b_1&gt;0$ and $b_2 &#160;, &#160;dots , b_N &#10;e 0,$ then the magnitude of $b_p$ quantifies how receptive the $n$&#45;th&#10;sensor is to activity within the $(n+p&#45;1)$&#45;th sensor. Finally, the $(m,n)$&#45;th&#10;entry of the matrix $mathbf D = frac{boldsymbol Sigma boldsymbol&#10;Sigma^text T}{2}$ is the covariance of the component noises injected into the&#10;$m$&#45;th and $n$&#45;th sensors. For different choices of $mathbf B$ and&#10;$boldsymbol Sigma,$ we investigate whether Cyclicity Analysis enables us to&#10;recover the structure of network. Roughly speaking, Cyclicity Analysis studies&#10;the lead&#45;lag dynamics pertaining to the components of a multivariate signal. We&#10;specifically consider an $N times N$ skew&#45;symmetric matrix $mathbf Q,$ known&#10;as the lead matrix, in which the sign of its $(m,n)$&#45;th entry captures the&#10;lead&#45;lag relationship between the $m$&#45;th and $n$&#45;th component OU processes. We&#10;investigate whether the structure of the leading eigenvector of $mathbf Q,$&#10;the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of $mathbf Q$ in&#10;modulus, reflects the network structure induced by $mathbf B.$&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12102v1) |&#10;| Symmetry&#45;Enriched Learning: A Category&#45;Theoretic Framework for Robust&#10; &#160;Machine Learning Models | Ronald Katende | &#160;&#160;This manuscript presents a novel framework that integrates higher&#45;order&#10;symmetries and category theory into machine learning. We introduce new&#10;mathematical constructs, including hyper&#45;symmetry categories and functorial&#10;representations, to model complex transformations within learning algorithms.&#10;Our contributions include the design of symmetry&#45;enriched learning models, the&#10;development of advanced optimization techniques leveraging categorical&#10;symmetries, and the theoretical analysis of their implications for model&#10;robustness, generalization, and convergence. Through rigorous proofs and&#10;practical applications, we demonstrate that incorporating higher&#45;dimensional&#10;categorical structures enhances both the theoretical foundations and practical&#10;capabilities of modern machine learning algorithms, opening new directions for&#10;research and innovation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12100v1) |&#10;| Brain&#45;Streams: fMRI&#45;to&#45;Image Reconstruction with Multi&#45;modal Guidance | Jaehoon Joo, Taejin Jeong, Seongjae Hwang | &#160;&#160;Understanding how humans process visual information is one of the crucial&#10;steps for unraveling the underlying mechanism of brain activity. Recently, this&#10;curiosity has motivated the fMRI&#45;to&#45;image reconstruction task; given the fMRI&#10;data from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual&#10;stimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent&#10;Diffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex&#10;visual stimuli such as high&#45;resolution natural images from vision datasets.&#10;Despite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often&#10;lack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.&#10;Consequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere&#10;visuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs&#10;effectively incorporate multi&#45;modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,&#10;and image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image&#10;generations. Specifically, inspired by the two&#45;streams hypothesis suggesting&#10;that perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain&#10;regions, our framework, Brain&#45;Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain&#10;regions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from&#10;semantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information&#10;regions, Brain&#45;Streams provides accurate multi&#45;modal guidance to LDMs. We&#10;validate the reconstruction ability of Brain&#45;Streams both quantitatively and&#10;qualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI&#10;data.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12099v1) |&#10;| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal&#10; &#160;execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huyên Pham | &#160;&#160;Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and&#10;constraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity&#10;markets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general&#10;propagator model under linear functional inequality constraints. The optimal&#10;control is given explicitly in terms of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers&#10;and their conditional expectations, as a solution to a linear stochastic&#10;Fredholm equation. We propose a stochastic version of the Uzawa algorithm on&#10;the dual problem to construct the stochastic Lagrange multipliers numerically&#10;via a stochastic projected gradient ascent, combined with a least&#45;squares Monte&#10;Carlo regression step to approximate their conditional expectations. We&#10;illustrate our findings on two different practical applications with stochastic&#10;signals: (i) an optimal execution problem with an exponential or a power law&#10;decaying transient impact, with either a `no&#45;shorting&#39; constraint in the&#10;presence of a `sell&#39; signal, a `no&#45;buying&#39; constraint in the presence of a&#10;`buy&#39; signal or a stochastic `stop&#45;trading&#39; constraint whenever the exogenous&#10;price drops below a specified reference level; (ii) a battery storage problem&#10;with instantaneous operating costs, seasonal signals and fixed constraints on&#10;both the charging power and the load capacity of the battery.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12098v1) |&#10;| Skill matching at scale: freelancer&#45;project alignment for efficient&#10; &#160;multilingual candidate retrieval | Warren Jouanneau, Marc Palyart, Emma Jouffroy | &#160;&#160;Finding the perfect match between a job proposal and a set of freelancers is&#10;not an easy task to perform at scale, especially in multiple languages.

The task of&#10;next&#45;best&#45;view (NBV) planning is to infer the pose of the next viewpoint based&#10;on the current data, and gradually realize the complete three&#45;dimensional&#10;reconstruction. Many existing algorithms, however, suffer a large computational&#10;burden due to the use of ray&#45;casting. To address this, this paper proposes a&#10;projection&#45;based NBV planning framework. It can select the next best view at an&#10;extremely fast speed while ensuring the complete scanning of the object.&#10;Specifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into&#10;ellipsoids based on the voxel structure.Then, the next best view is selected&#10;from the candidate views using a projection&#45;based viewpoint quality evaluation&#10;function in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy. This process&#10;replaces the ray&#45;casting in voxel structures, significantly improving the&#10;computational efficiency. Comparative experiments with other algorithms in a&#10;simulation environment show that the framework proposed in this paper can&#10;achieve 10 times efficiency improvement on the basis of capturing roughly the&#10;same coverage. The real&#45;world experimental results also prove the efficiency&#10;and feasibility of the framework.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12096v1) |&#10;| Undersampling effects on observed periods of coronal oscillations | Daye Lim, Tom Van Doorsselaere, Valery M. Nakariakov, Dmitrii Y. Kolotkov, Yuhang Gao, David Berghmans | &#160;&#160;Context. Recent observations of decayless transverse oscillations have shown&#10;two branches in the relationship between periods and loop lengths. One is a&#10;linear relationship, interpreted as a standing mode. The other shows almost no&#10;correlation and has not yet been interpreted conclusively. Aims. We&#10;investigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless&#10;oscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely&#10;follow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations&#10;are standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations&#10;where the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase&#10;are randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal&#10;by considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of&#10;telescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast&#10;Fourier transform. Results. When the sampling cadence is getting closer to the&#10;actual oscillation period, a tendency for overestimating periods in short loops&#10;is enhanced. The relationship between loop lengths and periods of the sampled&#10;signals shows the two branches as in the observation. Conclusions. We find that&#10;long periods of decayless oscillations occurring in short loops could be the&#10;result of undersampling.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12095v1) |&#10;| Enwrapped Perylene Bisimide Enables Room Temperature Polariton Lasing&#10; &#160;and Photonic Lattices | Dominik Horneber, Johannes Düreth, Tim Schembri, Simon Betzold, Matthias Stolte, Sven Höfling, Frank Würthner, Sebastian Klembt | &#160;&#160;Perylene bisimides (PBIs) are organic dyes with photoluminescence quantum&#10;yields (PLQY) close to unity in solution and great thermal and photo&#45;chemical&#10;stability. These features alongside the tunability of their solid&#45;state packing&#10;arrangement via chemical functionalization make this material class an&#10;excellent candidate for exciton&#45;polariton lasing at room temperature. Polariton&#10;lasing is well understood in III&#45;V semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures,&#10;however, the search for emitter materials for robust and versatile room&#10;temperature applications is ongoing. While e.g. perovskites and several organic&#10;materials have been identified to support polariton lasing, many of these&#10;materials lack tunability and long&#45;term stability under ambient conditions.&#10;Here, we fabricate optical microcavities using a strongly enwrapped PBI&#10;chromophore with prevailing monomer&#45;like absorption and emission properties in&#10;the solid state. Voluminous bay&#45;substituents prevent stacking induced&#10;PLQY&#45;quenching, thereby enabling polariton lasing at room temperature.&#10;Additionally, photonic confinement in single hemispheric resonators is&#10;demonstrated leading to localized polaritonic modes with discrete energies, as&#10;well as optical lattices revealing distinct polaritonic band&#45;structures. Due to&#10;the possibility of tunable properties by the precise control of the solid&#45;state&#10;packing arrangement of PBI emitters, our results pave the way for&#10;polarization&#45;dependent light&#45;matter coupling, including topological photonic&#10;effects within oriented crystalline thin&#45;film microcavity structures.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12093v1) |&#10;| IMRL: Integrating Visual, Physical, Temporal, and Geometric&#10; &#160;Representations for Enhanced Food Acquisition | Rui Liu, Zahiruddin Mahammad, Amisha Bhaskar, Pratap Tokekar | &#160;&#160;Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality&#10;of life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse&#10;food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents&#10;unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface&#45;level geometric&#10;information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g.,&#10;color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially&#10;when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance.&#10;We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition.&#10;Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy&#10;based on off&#45;the&#45;shelf image encoders such as ResNet&#45;50. However, such&#10;representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse&#10;acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel&#10;approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi&#45;Dimensional Representation Learning), which&#10;integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance&#10;the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach&#10;captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi&#45;solid, granular,&#10;liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and&#10;introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and&#10;assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies&#10;based on context, improving the robot&#39;s capability to handle diverse food&#10;acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach&#39;s&#10;robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations,&#10;including zero&#45;shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves&#10;improvement up to $35%$ in success rate compared with the best&#45;performing&#10;baseline.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12092v1) |&#10;| Uncovering liquid&#45;substrate fluctuation effects on crystal growth and&#10; &#160;disordered hyperuniformity of two&#45;dimensional materials | S.

Motivated by recent experiments which achieved&#10;unprecedented fast growth of large&#45;size high&#45;quality 2D crystals on liquid&#10;substrates, we uncover novel effects of liquid surfaces on microstructural&#10;ordering. We find that substrate fluctuations generate short&#45;ranged noise that&#10;speeds up crystallization and grain growth of the overlayer, surpassing that of&#10;free&#45;standing system. Coupling to the liquid substrate fluctuations can also&#10;modulate local randomness, leading to intriguing disordered structures with&#10;hidden spatial order, i.e., disordered hyperuniformity.

To navigate such environments,&#10;agents benefit from information on the various elements (e.g., buttons, text,&#10;or images) present. It remains unclear which element attributes have the&#10;greatest impact on agent performance, especially in environments that only&#10;provide a graphical representation (i.e., pixels). Here we find that the&#10;ordering in which elements are presented to the language model is surprisingly&#10;impactful&#45;&#45;randomizing element ordering in a webpage degrades agent performance&#10;comparably to removing all visible text from an agent&#39;s state representation.&#10;While a webpage provides a hierarchical ordering of elements, there is no such&#10;ordering when parsing elements directly from pixels. Moreover, as tasks become&#10;more challenging and models more sophisticated, our experiments suggest that&#10;the impact of ordering increases. Finding an effective ordering is non&#45;trivial.&#10;We investigate the impact of various element ordering methods in web and&#10;desktop environments. We find that dimensionality reduction provides a viable&#10;ordering for pixel&#45;only environments. We train a UI element detection model to&#10;derive elements from pixels and apply our findings to an agent&#10;benchmark&#45;&#45;OmniACT&#45;&#45;where we only have access to pixels.

At zero temperature for baryon chemical potentials below&#10;the mass of the Lambda baryon, only nucleons contribute to the quark density.&#10;This is different at finite temperature, where all baryons, mesons and their&#10;resonances can be excited and thus add quarks to the phase space. The&#10;probability density to find a quark inside a hadron is determined using the&#10;Yukawa ansatz of the IdylliQ model of Quarkyonic Matter. We estimate separately&#10;the magnitude of the various contributions of nucleons, Delta baryons, pions as&#10;well as further hadrons and resonances. The uncertainty in the parametrization&#10;of the probability density to find a quark inside a nucleon is spanned by&#10;assuming that at zero temperature the transition density to Quarkyonic Matter&#10;is between one and three times that of nuclear matter. Various predictions for&#10;a possible critical point associated with the chiral phase transition are found&#10;close to a triple point at which the line of the deconfinement transition and&#10;the curve associated with the transition to Quarkyonic Matter intersect.

Although cut&#45;based strategies for boosted top&#10;tagging, which rely on substructure information from fat jets resulting from&#10;the hadronic decay of boosted top quarks, were introduced in the literature as&#10;early as 2008, recent years have witnessed a surge in the utilization of&#10;machine learning&#45;based approaches for the classification of top&#45;jets from QCD&#10;jets. The review focuses on the present status of boosted top tagging and its&#10;application for BSM searchers.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12085v1) |&#10;| The $η_c$&#45;meson leading&#45;twist distribution amplitude | Benoît Blossier, Mariane Mangin&#45;Brinet, José Manuel Morgado Chávez, Teseo San José | &#160;&#160;In this project, we employ the short&#45;distance factorization to compute the&#10;distribution amplitude of the $eta_c$&#45;meson from Lattice QCD at leading twist.&#10;We employ a set of CLS $N_f=2$ ensembles at three lattice spacings and various&#10;quark masses to extrapolate the pseudo distribution to the physical point in&#10;the isospin limit. We solve the inverse problem modeling the distribution&#10;amplitude, and we match our results to the light&#45;cone in the&#10;$overline{text{MS}}$&#45;scheme. We include a complete error budget, and we&#10;compare to two alternative approaches: non&#45;relativistic QCD and Dyson&#45;Schwinger&#10;equations, finding good agreement with the latter but not with the former.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12084v1) |&#10;| The asymptotic behavior of solutions to a doubly degenerate&#10; &#160;chemotaxis&#45;consumption system in two&#45;dimensional setting | Duan Wu | &#160;&#160;The present work proceeds to consider the convergence of the solutions to the&#10;following doubly degenerate chemotaxis&#45;consumption system begin{align*}&#10;&#10;eft{ begin{array}{r@{,}l@{quad}l@{,}c}&#10;&amp;u_{t}=&#10;ablacdotbig(u^{m&#45;1}v&#10;abla vbig)&#45;&#10;ablacdotbig(f(u)v&#10;abla&#10;vbig)+ell uv,\ &amp;v_{t}=Delta v&#45;uv, end{array}&#13;ight.%} end{align*} under&#10;no&#45;flux boundary conditions in a smoothly bounded convex domain $Omegasubset&#10;R^2$, where the nonnegative function $fin C^1([0,infty))$ is asked to&#10;satisfy $f(s)&#10;e C_fs^{al}$ with $al, C_f&gt;0$ for all $sge 1$.&#10; &#160;The global existence of weak solutions or classical solutions to the above&#10;system has been established in both one&#45; and two&#45;dimensional bounded convex&#10;domains in previous works. However, the results concerning the large time&#10;behavior are still constrained to one dimension due to the lack of a&#10;Harnack&#45;type inequality in the two&#45;dimensional case. In this note, we&#10;complement this result by using the Moser iteration technique and building a&#10;new Harnack&#45;type inequality.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12083v1) |&#10;| ReLU Surrogates in Mixed&#45;Integer MPC for Irrigation Scheduling | Bernard T. Agyeman, Jinfeng Liu, Sirish L. Shah | &#160;&#160;Efficient water management in agriculture is important for mitigating the&#10;growing freshwater scarcity crisis. Mixed&#45;integer Model Predictive Control&#10;(MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex&#10;scheduling problems in agricultural irrigation. However, the computational&#10;complexity of mixed&#45;integer MPC still poses a significant challenge,&#10;particularly in large&#45;scale applications. This study proposes an approach to&#10;enhance the computational efficiency of mixed&#45;integer MPC&#45;based irrigation&#10;schedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture&#10;dynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed&#45;integer linear&#10;representation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the&#10;mixed&#45;integer MPC&#45;based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a&#10;mixed&#45;integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed&#45;integer&#10;nonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global&#10;optimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated&#10;through comparative studies conducted on a large&#45;scale agricultural field&#10;across two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models,&#10;specifically Long Short&#45;Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used&#10;triggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU&#45;based approach significantly&#10;reduces solution times &#45;&#45; by up to 99.5% &#45;&#45; while achieving comparable&#10;performance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water&#10;Use Efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, the ReLU&#45;based approach maintains enhanced&#10;performance in terms of total prescribed irrigation and IWUE compared to the&#10;widely&#45;used triggered irrigation scheduling method.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12082v1) |&#10;| Design of Ligand&#45;Binding Proteins with Atomic Flow Matching | Junqi Liu, Shaoning Li, Chence Shi, Zhi Yang, Jian Tang | &#160;&#160;Designing novel proteins that bind to small molecules is a long&#45;standing&#10;challenge in computational biology, with applications in developing catalysts,&#10;biosensors, and more. Current computational methods rely on the assumption that&#10;the binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible,&#10;as conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon&#10;binding. In this work, we formulate proteins and molecules as unified&#10;biotokens, and present AtomFlow, a novel deep generative model under the&#10;flow&#45;matching framework for the design of ligand&#45;binding proteins from the 2D&#10;target molecular graph alone. Operating on representative atoms of biotokens,&#10;AtomFlow captures the flexibility of ligands and generates ligand conformations&#10;and protein backbone structures iteratively. We consider the multi&#45;scale nature&#10;of biotokens and demonstrate that AtomFlow can be effectively trained on a&#10;subset of structures from the Protein Data Bank, by matching flow vector field&#10;using an SE(3) equivariant structure prediction network. Experimental results&#10;show that our method can generate high fidelity ligand&#45;binding proteins and&#10;achieve performance comparable to the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art model RFDiffusionAA,&#10;while not requiring bound ligand structures. As a general framework, AtomFlow&#10;holds the potential to be applied to various biomolecule generation tasks in&#10;the future.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12080v1) |&#10;| Denoising diffusion models for high&#45;resolution microscopy image&#10; &#160;restoration | Pamela Osuna&#45;Vargas, Maren H. Wehrheim, Lucas Zinz, Johanna Rahm, Ashwin Balakrishnan, Alexandra Kaminer, Mike Heilemann, Matthias Kaschube | &#160;&#160;Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at&#10;the nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological&#10;organization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of&#10;fluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses&#10;remain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced&#10;laser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and&#10;increased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a&#10;denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high&#45;resolution&#10;images by conditioning the model on low&#45;resolution information. Additionally,&#10;the probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images&#10;that tend to further increase the signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio. We show that our model&#10;achieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously&#10;best&#45;performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly,&#10;while any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but&#10;not all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all&#10;four data sets, suggesting high generalizability.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12078v1) |&#10;| Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Via Data Pruning | Andrea Napoli, Paul White | &#160;&#160;The removal of carefully&#45;selected examples from training data has recently&#10;emerged as an effective way of improving the robustness of machine learning&#10;models. However, the best way to select these examples remains an open&#10;question. In this paper, we consider the problem from the perspective of&#10;unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). We propose AdaPrune, a method for UDA&#10;whereby training examples are removed to attempt to align the training&#10;distribution to that of the target data. By adopting the maximum mean&#10;discrepancy (MMD) as the criterion for alignment, the problem can be neatly&#10;formulated and solved as an integer quadratic program. We evaluate our approach&#10;on a real&#45;world domain shift task of bioacoustic event detection. As a method&#10;for UDA, we show that AdaPrune outperforms related techniques, and is&#10;complementary to other UDA algorithms such as CORAL. Our analysis of the&#10;relationship between the MMD and model accuracy, along with t&#45;SNE plots,&#10;validate the proposed method as a principled and well&#45;founded way of performing&#10;data pruning.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12076v1) |&#10;| The elastica sling | Alessandro Cazzolli, Francesco Dal Corso | &#160;&#160;The nonlinear mechanics of a flexible elastic rod constrained at its edges by&#10;a pair of sliding sleeves is analyzed. The planar equilibrium configurations of&#10;this variable&#45;length elastica are found to have shape defined only by the&#10;inclination of the two constraints, while their distance is responsible only&#10;for scaling the size. By extending the theoretical stability criterion&#10;available for systems under isoperimetric constraints to the case of variable&#10;domains, the existence of no more than one stable equilibrium solution is&#10;revealed. The set of sliding sleeves&#39; inclination pairs for which the stability&#10;is lost are identified. Such critical conditions allow the indefinite ejection&#10;of the flexible rod from the sliding sleeves, thus realizing an elastica sling.&#10;Finally, the theoretical findings are validated by experiments on a physical&#10;prototype. The present results lead to a novel actuation principle that may&#10;find application as a mechanism in energy harvesting, wave mitigation devices,&#10;and soft robotic locomotion.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12075v1) |&#10;| Online Refractive Camera Model Calibration in Visual Inertial Odometry | Mohit Singh, Kostas Alexis | &#160;&#160;This paper presents a general refractive camera model and online&#10;co&#45;estimation of odometry and the refractive index of unknown media. This&#10;enables operation in diverse and varying refractive fluids, given only the&#10;camera calibration in air. The refractive index is estimated online as a state&#10;variable of a monocular visual&#45;inertial odometry framework in an iterative&#10;formulation using the proposed camera model. The method was verified on data&#10;collected using an underwater robot traversing inside a pool. The evaluations&#10;demonstrate convergence to the ideal refractive index for water despite&#10;significant perturbations in the initialization. Simultaneously, the approach&#10;enables on&#45;par visual&#45;inertial odometry performance in refractive media without&#10;prior knowledge of the refractive index or requirement of medium&#45;specific&#10;camera calibration.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12074v1) |&#10;| Influence of dislocations in multilayer graphene stacks: A phase field&#10; &#160;crystal study | K. R. Elder, Zhi&#45;Feng Huang, T. Ala&#45;Nissila | &#160;&#160;In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene&#10;stacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a&#10;recently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems&#10;incorporating out&#45;of&#45;plane deformations and parameterized to match to density&#10;functional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems. The&#10;specific configuration considered consists of one monolayer containing four&#10;$5|7$ dislocations (i.e., two dislocation dipoles) sandwiched in between&#10;perfect graphene layers. The study reveals how the strain field from the&#10;dislocations in the defected layer leads to out&#45;of&#45;plane deformations that in&#10;turn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are&#10;made for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a&#10;defect&#45;free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and&#10;system size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by&#10;roughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence&#10;across the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height&#10;profiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12073v1) |&#10;| PAD&#45;FT: A Lightweight Defense for Backdoor Attacks via Data Purification&#10; &#160;and Fine&#45;Tuning | Yukai Xu, Yujie Gu, Kouichi Sakurai | &#160;&#160;Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks,&#10;particularly as recent advancements have led to increasingly subtle&#10;implantation, making the defense more challenging. Existing defense mechanisms&#10;typically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and&#10;involve retraining an auxiliary model or fine&#45;tuning the entire victim model.&#10;However, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always&#10;feasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and&#10;lightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD&#45;FT, that does not require an&#10;additional clean dataset and fine&#45;tunes only a very small part of the model to&#10;disinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a&#10;simple data purification process to identify and select the most&#45;likely clean&#10;data from the poisoned training dataset. The self&#45;purified clean dataset is&#10;then used for activation clipping and fine&#45;tuning only the last classification&#10;layer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation&#10;clipping, and classifier fine&#45;tuning, our mechanism PAD&#45;FT demonstrates&#10;superior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as&#10;confirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12072v1) |&#10;| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing&#10; &#160;data in Irish sagas | P. MacCarron | &#160;&#160;For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts&#10;in order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify&#10;similarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the&#10;significance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture&#10;requires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and&#10;often impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the&#10;network of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that&#10;the top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent&#10;with central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has&#10;been lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust&#10;to a large random removal of edges.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12071v1) |&#10;| The repetition threshold for ternary rich words | James D. Currie, Lucas Mol, Jarkko Peltomäki | &#160;&#160;In 2014, Vesti proposed the problem of determining the repetition threshold&#10;for infinite rich words, i.e., for infinite words in which all factors of&#10;length $n$ contain $n$ distinct nonempty palindromic factors. In 2020, Currie,&#10;Mol, and Rampersad proved a conjecture of Baranwal and Shallit that the&#10;repetition threshold for binary rich words is $2 + sqrt{2}/2$. In this paper,&#10;we prove a structure theorem for $16/7$&#45;power&#45;free ternary rich words. Using&#10;the structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich&#10;words is $1 + 1/(3 &#45; mu) approx 2.25876324$, where $mu$ is the unique real&#10;root of the polynomial $x^3 &#45; 2x^2 &#45; 1$.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12068v1) |&#10;| Fitting Multilevel Factor Models | Tetiana Parshakova, Trevor Hastie, Stephen Boyd | &#160;&#160;We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance&#10;given by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~cite{parshakova2023factor}. We&#10;develop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation&#45;maximization (EM)&#10;algorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of&#10;the observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and&#10;maintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved&#10;through a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive&#10;definite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of an invertible PSD MLR matrix&#10;is also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the&#10;recursive Sherman&#45;Morrison&#45;Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of&#10;the inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky&#10;factorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities,&#10;yielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement. This paper is&#10;accompanied by an open&#45;source package that implements the proposed methods.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12067v1) |&#10;| Drifts of the sub&#45;stellar points of the TRAPPIST&#45;1 planets | Revol Alexandre, Émeline Bolmont, Mariana Sastre, Gabriel Tobie, Anne&#45;Sophie Libert, Mathilde Kervazo, Sergi Blanco&#45;Cuaresma | &#160;&#160;Accurate modeling of tidal interactions is crucial for interpreting recent&#10;JWST observations of the thermal emissions of TRAPPIST&#45;1~b and c and for&#10;characterizing the surface conditions and potential habitability of the other&#10;planets in the system. Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by&#10;tidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to&#10;their proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the&#10;TRAPPIST&#45;1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In&#10;this work, we present the recent implementation of the co&#45;planar tidal torque&#10;and forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N&#45;body code&#10;Posidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using&#10;a tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of&#10;each planet by taking into account their multi&#45;layer internal structure&#10;computed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST&#45;1 planets&#10;are not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state.&#10;Planet&#45;planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and&#10;tides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a&#10;result, the sub&#45;stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and&#10;long&#45;timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with&#10;periods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12065v1) |&#10;| Quantum Magic and Multi&#45;Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei | Florian Brökemeier, S. Momme Hengstenberg, James W. T. Keeble, Caroline E. P. Robin, Federico Rocco, Martin J. Savage | &#160;&#160;Motivated by the Gottesman&#45;Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the&#10;quantum complexity of $p$&#45;shell and $sd$&#45;shell nuclei. Valence&#45;space nuclear&#10;shell&#45;model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit&#10;registers using the Jordan&#45;Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$&#45;shell and 24&#10;qubits for the $sd$&#45;shell), from which measures of the many&#45;body entanglement&#10;($n$&#45;tangles) and magic (non&#45;stabilizerness) are determined. While exact&#10;evaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of&#10;active nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex&#10;nuclei. The broadly&#45;applicable Pauli&#45;String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe&#45;) MCMC technique&#10;is introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed&#10;nuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $sim 8$ for some&#10;nuclei. Significant multi&#45;nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$&#45;shell,&#10;dominated by proton&#45;neutron configurations, along with significant measures of&#10;magic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on&#10;the path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion.&#10;These results indicate that quantum&#45;computing resources will accelerate&#10;precision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12064v1) |&#10;| Post&#45;Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a&#10; &#160;massive, rotating object | Lorenzo Iorio | &#160;&#160;The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the&#10;general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense&#45;Thirring&#10;components of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are&#10;analytically worked out to the first post&#45;Newtonian level. To the Newtonian&#10;order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as&#10;well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation&#10;in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the&#10;primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first&#10;to &#39;Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system&#10;along an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred&#10;close to the Sun&#39;s flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due&#10;to the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of&#10;microarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for&#10;the post&#45;Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)&#10;spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of&#10;the latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current&#10;(formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would&#10;bring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the&#10;predicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not&#10;changed by any of the post&#45;&#45;Keplerian accelerations considered. The&#10;calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any&#10;alternative models of gravity as well.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12063v1) |&#10;| Generalized Robot Learning Framework | Jiahuan Yan, Zhouyang Hong, Yu Zhao, Yu Tian, Yunxin Liu, Travis Davies, Luhui Hu | &#160;&#160;Imitation based robot learning has recently gained significant attention in&#10;the robotics field due to its theoretical potential for transferability and&#10;generalizability. However, it remains notoriously costly, both in terms of&#10;hardware and data collection, and deploying it in real&#45;world environments&#10;demands meticulous setup of robots and precise experimental conditions. In this&#10;paper, we present a low&#45;cost robot learning framework that is both easily&#10;reproducible and transferable to various robots and environments. We&#10;demonstrate that deployable imitation learning can be successfully applied even&#10;to industrial&#45;grade robots, not just expensive collaborative robotic arms.&#10;Furthermore, our results show that multi&#45;task robot learning is achievable with&#10;simple network architectures and fewer demonstrations than previously thought&#10;necessary. As the current evaluating method is almost subjective when it comes&#10;to real&#45;world manipulation tasks, we propose Voting Positive Rate (VPR) &#45; a&#10;novel evaluation strategy that provides a more objective assessment of&#10;performance. We conduct an extensive comparison of success rates across various&#10;self&#45;designed tasks to validate our approach.

However, the prevailing notion of paraphrase is often quite&#10;simplistic, offering only a limited view of the vast spectrum of paraphrase&#10;phenomena. Indeed, we find that evaluating models in a paraphrase dataset can&#10;leave uncertainty about their true semantic understanding. To alleviate this,&#10;we release paraphrasus, a benchmark designed for multi&#45;dimensional assessment&#10;of paraphrase detection models and finer model selection. We find that&#10;paraphrase detection models under a fine&#45;grained evaluation lens exhibit&#10;trade&#45;offs that cannot be captured through a single classification dataset.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12060v1) |&#10;| Dual&#45;Layer Training and Decoding of Large Language Model with&#10; &#160;Simultaneously Thinking and Speaking | Ningyuan Xi, Xiaoyu Wang, Yetao Wu, Teng Chen, Qingqing Gu, Jinxian Qu, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong Chen, Luo Ji | &#160;&#160;Large Language Model can reasonably understand and generate human expressions&#10;but may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have&#10;been several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but&#10;most of them are not data&#45;driven or training&#45;based. In this paper, we are&#10;motivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel&#10;model architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts&#10;and then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines&#10;to annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt&#45;response samples, then&#10;add language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We&#10;train the language model by the thoughts&#45;augmented data and successfully let&#10;the thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally&#10;output more reasonable responses.

Recent advances in zkML have&#10;substantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily&#10;optimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the&#10;substantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the&#10;model and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new&#10;Commit&#45;and&#45;Prove SNARK (CP&#45;SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that&#10;effectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML&#10;pipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white&#45;box use of the&#10;underlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic&#10;polynomial commitment and only makes black&#45;box use of the proof system. As a&#10;result, Artemis is compatible with state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art proof systems without&#10;trusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP&#45;SNARKs, evaluate&#10;their performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial&#10;improvements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover&#10;costs and maintaining efficiency even for large&#45;scale models. For example, for&#10;the VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from&#10;11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML&#10;towards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and&#10;complex ML models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12055v1) |&#10;| MMP for Enriques pairs and singular Enriques varieties | Francesco Antonio Denisi, Ángel David Ríos Ortiz, Nikolaos Tsakanikas, Zhixin Xie | &#160;&#160;We introduce and study the class of primitive Enriques varieties, whose&#10;smooth members are Enriques manifolds. We provide several examples and we&#10;demonstrate that this class is stable under the operations of the Minimal Model&#10;Program (MMP). In particular, given an Enriques manifold $Y$ and an effective&#10;$mathbb{R}$&#45;divisor $B_Y$ on $Y$ such that the pair $(Y,B_Y)$ is log&#10;canonical, we prove that any $(K_Y+B_Y)$&#45;MMP terminates with a minimal model&#10;$(Y&#39;,B_{Y&#39;})$ of $(Y,B_Y)$, where $Y&#39;$ is a $mathbb{Q}$&#45;factorial primitive&#10;Enriques variety with canonical singularities. Finally, we investigate the&#10;asymptotic theory of Enriques manifolds.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12054v1) |&#10;| Numerical renormalization group calculations for magnetic impurity&#10; &#160;systems with spin&#45;orbit coupling and crystal&#45;field effects | Aitor Calvo&#45;Fernández, María Blanco&#45;Rey, Asier Eiguren | &#160;&#160;Exploiting symmetries in the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method&#10;significantly enhances performance by improving accuracy, increasing&#10;computational speed, and optimizing memory efficiency. Published codes focus on&#10;continuous rotations and unitary groups, which generally are not applicable to&#10;systems with strong crystal&#45;field effects. The PointGroupNRG code implements&#10;symmetries related to discrete rotation groups, which are defined by the user&#10;in terms of Clebsch&#45;Gordan coefficients, together with particle conservation&#10;and spin rotation symmetries. In this paper we present a new version of the&#10;code that extends the available finite groups, previously limited to simply&#10;reducible point groups, in a way that all point and double groups become&#10;accessible. It also includes the full spin&#45;orbital rotation group. Moreover, to&#10;improve the code&#39;s flexibility for impurities with complex interactions, this&#10;new version allows to choose between a standard Anderson Hamiltonian for the&#10;impurity or, as another novel feature, an ionic model that requires only the&#10;spectrum and the impurity Lehmann amplitudes.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12050v1) |&#10;| Quantum&#45;like nonlinear interferometry with frequency&#45;engineered&#10; &#160;classical light | Romain Dalidet, Anthony Martin, Grégory Sauder, Laurent Labonté, Sébastien Tanzilli | &#160;&#160;Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic&#10;entanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits. Nonlinear&#10;optics has served as a workhorse for the generation of entangled photon pairs,&#10;ensuring both energy and phase conservation, but at the cost of limited rate&#10;and degraded signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio compared to laser&#45;based interferometry&#10;approaches. We present a &quot;quantum&#45;like&quot; nonlinear optical method that reaches&#10;super&#45;resolution in single&#45;photon detection regime. This is achieved by&#10;replacing photon&#45;pairs by coherent states of light, mimicking quantum&#10;properties through classical nonlinear optics processes. Our scheme utilizes&#10;two high&#45;brightness lasers. This results in a substantially greater&#10;signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio compared to its quantum counterpart. Such an approach&#10;paves the way to significantly reduced acquisition times, providing a pathway&#10;to explore signals across a broader range of bandwidth. The need to increase&#10;the frequency bandwidth of the quantum sensor significantly motivates the&#10;potential applications of this pathway.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12049v1) |&#10;| A Survey&#45;Based Quantitative Analysis of Stress Factors and Their Impacts&#10; &#160;Among Cybersecurity Professionals | Sunil Arora, John D. Hastings | &#160;&#160;This study investigates the prevalence and underlying causes of work&#45;related&#10;stress and burnout among cybersecurity professionals using a quantitative&#10;survey approach guided by the Job Demands&#45;Resources model. Analysis of&#10;responses from 50 cybersecurity practitioners reveals an alarming reality: 44%&#10;report experiencing severe work&#45;related stress and burnout, while an additional&#10;28% are uncertain about their condition. The demanding nature of cybersecurity&#10;roles, unrealistic expectations, and unsupportive organizational cultures&#10;emerge as primary factors fueling this crisis. Notably, 66% of respondents&#10;perceive cybersecurity jobs as more stressful than other IT positions, with 84%&#10;facing additional challenges due to the pandemic and recent high&#45;profile&#10;breaches. The study finds that most cybersecurity experts are reluctant to&#10;report their struggles to management, perpetuating a cycle of silence and&#10;neglect. To address this critical issue, the paper recommends that&#10;organizations foster supportive work environments, implement mindfulness&#10;programs, and address systemic challenges. By prioritizing the mental health of&#10;cybersecurity professionals, organizations can cultivate a more resilient and&#10;effective workforce to protect against an ever&#45;evolving threat landscape.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12047v1) |&#10;| Using Large Language Models to Generate Clinical Trial Tables and&#10; &#160;Figures | Yumeng Yang, Peter Krusche, Kristyn Pantoja, Cheng Shi, Ethan Ludmir, Kirk Roberts, Gen Zhu | &#160;&#160;Tables, figures, and listings (TFLs) are essential tools for summarizing&#10;clinical trial data. Creation of TFLs for reporting activities is often a&#10;time&#45;consuming task encountered routinely during the execution of clinical&#10;trials. This study explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate&#10;the generation of TFLs through prompt engineering and few&#45;shot transfer&#10;learning. Using public clinical trial data in ADaM format, our results&#10;demonstrated that LLMs can efficiently generate TFLs with prompt instructions,&#10;showcasing their potential in this domain. Furthermore, we developed a&#10;conservational agent named Clinical Trial TFL Generation Agent: An app that&#10;matches user queries to predefined prompts that produce customized programs to&#10;generate specific predefined TFLs.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12046v2) |&#10;| Handling Long&#45;Term Safety and Uncertainty in Safe Reinforcement Learning | Jonas Günster, Puze Liu, Jan Peters, Davide Tateo | &#160;&#160;Safety is one of the key issues preventing the deployment of reinforcement&#10;learning techniques in real&#45;world robots. While most approaches in the Safe&#10;Reinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and&#10;robot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them&#10;in complex real&#45;world settings. Instead, model&#45;based approaches that&#10;incorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning&#10;framework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on&#10;the real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot&#10;dynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task&#45;specific and hard&#10;to obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to&#10;compute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long&#45;term safety&#10;requirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe&#10;exploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus&#10;on ensuring long&#45;term safety and handling of uncertainty. Our approach is&#10;competitive or superior to state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methods in final performance while&#10;maintaining safer behavior during training.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12045v1) |&#10;| Quasiperiodic Floquet&#45;Gibbs states in Rydberg atomic systems | Wilson S. Martins, Federico Carollo, Kay Brandner, Igor Lesanovsky | &#160;&#160;Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by&#10;fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an&#10;equilibrium&#45;like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet&#45;Magnus&#10;Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi&#39;s golden rule, we show&#10;that such Floquet&#45;Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated&#10;Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab&#45;frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function&#10;of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the&#10;system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which&#10;is necessary to uphold high&#45;lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To&#10;corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five&#10;interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate&#10;numerically that the second&#45;order Floquet&#45;Gibbs state of this system is&#10;essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding&#10;Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently&#10;large.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12044v1) |&#10;| Understanding the Effects of the Baidu&#45;ULTR Logging Policy on Two&#45;Tower&#10; &#160;Models | Morris de Haan, Philipp Hager | &#160;&#160;Despite the popularity of the two&#45;tower model for unbiased learning to rank&#10;(ULTR) tasks, recent work suggests that it suffers from a major limitation that&#10;could lead to its collapse in industry applications: the problem of logging&#10;policy confounding. Several potential solutions have even been proposed;&#10;however, the evaluation of these methods was mostly conducted using&#10;semi&#45;synthetic simulation experiments. This paper bridges the gap between&#10;theory and practice by investigating the confounding problem on the largest&#10;real&#45;world dataset, Baidu&#45;ULTR. Our main contributions are threefold: 1) we&#10;show that the conditions for the confounding problem are given on Baidu&#45;ULTR,&#10;2) the confounding problem bears no significant effect on the two&#45;tower model,&#10;and 3) we point to a potential mismatch between expert annotations, the golden&#10;standard in ULTR, and user click behavior.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12043v1) |&#10;| ASR Benchmarking: Need for a More Representative Conversational Dataset | Gaurav Maheshwari, Dmitry Ivanov, Théo Johannet, Kevin El Haddad | &#160;&#160;Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable&#10;performance on widely used benchmarks such as LibriSpeech and Fleurs. However,&#10;these benchmarks do not adequately reflect the complexities of real&#45;world&#10;conversational environments, where speech is often unstructured and contains&#10;disfluencies such as pauses, interruptions, and diverse accents. In this study,&#10;we introduce a multilingual conversational dataset, derived from TalkBank,&#10;consisting of unstructured phone conversation between adults. Our results show&#10;a significant performance drop across various state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art ASR models when&#10;tested in conversational settings. Furthermore, we observe a correlation&#10;between Word Error Rate and the presence of speech disfluencies, highlighting&#10;the critical need for more realistic, conversational ASR benchmarks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12042v1) |&#10;&#10;">

First, via a substantial corpus of&#10;51,278 interview questions sourced from 888 YouTube videos of mock interviews&#10;of Indian civil service candidates, we demonstrate stark gender bias in the&#10;broad nature of questions asked to male and female candidates. Second, our&#10;experiments with large language models show a strong presence of gender bias in&#10;explanations provided by the LLMs on the gender inference task.

However, current methods often require hundreds to&#10;thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high&#45;dimensional visual&#10;observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual&#10;representations are predominantly either pretrained on out&#45;of&#45;domain data or&#10;trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present&#10;DynaMo, a new in&#45;domain, self&#45;supervised method for learning visual&#10;representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a&#10;latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of&#10;image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without&#10;augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.&#10;Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out&#45;of&#45;domain data such as Internet&#10;datasets or cross&#45;embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real&#10;environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly&#10;improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self&#45;supervised&#10;learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo&#10;hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,&#10;and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and&#10;measure its impact on downstream policy performance.

Qwen2&#45;VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,&#10;which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions&#10;into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to&#10;generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning&#10;with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary&#10;Position Embedding (M&#45;RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional&#10;information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for&#10;processing both images and videos, enhancing the model&#39;s visual perception&#10;capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2&#45;VL&#10;investigates the scaling laws for large vision&#45;language models (LVLMs). By&#10;scaling both the model size&#45;with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters&#45;and the&#10;amount of training data, the Qwen2&#45;VL Series achieves highly competitive&#10;performance. Notably, the Qwen2&#45;VL&#45;72B model achieves results comparable to&#10;leading models such as GPT&#45;4o and Claude3.5&#45;Sonnet across various multimodal&#10;benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models.

BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses&#10;and 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance&#10;of deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to&#10;integrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and&#10;performance. However, widely&#45;used C++&#45;based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,&#10;g$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries&#10;like PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of&#10;debugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we&#10;introduce an eager&#45;mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,&#10;providing PyTorch&#45;compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach&#10;includes GPU&#45;accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for&#10;2nd&#45;order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear&#10;solvers. Our eager&#45;mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency,&#10;achieving an average speedup of 18.5$times$, 22$times$, and 23$times$&#10;compared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12190v1) |&#10;| Massively Multi&#45;Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context | Felix B Mueller, Julian Tanke, Juergen Gall | &#160;&#160;Forecasting long&#45;term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of&#10;human behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input&#10;sequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby&#10;people can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene&#45;aware social&#10;transformer model (SAST) to forecast long&#45;term (10s) human motion motion.&#10;Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely&#10;varying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal&#10;convolutional encoder&#45;decoder architecture with a Transformer&#45;based bottleneck&#10;that allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model&#10;the conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We&#10;benchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to&#10;16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously.

Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon | &#160;&#160;Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a&#10;perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from&#10;fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($mu$&#45;distortion) to late&#45;time&#10;baryonic feedback processes (y&#45;distortion). While the y&#45;distortion can be&#10;detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the&#10;$Lambda$CDM&#45;predicted $mu$&#45;distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude&#10;smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a&#10;serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $mu$&#10;arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the&#10;primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k approx 1&#45;10^{4}$ Mpc$^{&#45;1}$. Here,&#10;we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly&#10;detecting $mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but&#10;with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we&#10;optimize the instrument&#39;s configuration to target $mu$ while robustly&#10;marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike&#10;Fourier&#45;transform&#45;spectrometer&#45;based designs, the specific bands and their&#10;individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing&#10;significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the&#10;$Lambda$CDM&#45;predicted $mu$&#45;distortion at $approx 5sigma$ (10$sigma$)&#10;assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission&#10;duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized&#10;configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1&#45;2000 GHz with degree&#45;scale angular&#10;resolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally&#10;measure the y&#45;distortion at sub&#45;percent precision and its relativistic&#10;correction at percent&#45;level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total&#10;thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12188v1) |&#10;| Exoplanet accretion monitoring spectroscopic survey (ENTROPY) I.&#10; &#160;Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary&#45;mass&#10; &#160;object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C.

Detection of emission lines from&#10;accreting gas giants facilitate detailed investigations into this process. This&#10;work presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known&#10;young, planetary&#45;mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf&#10;2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7&#45;21 Mj and age 5&#45;45 Myr, located at 45+&#45;2&#10;pc. We obtained the first high&#45;resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target&#10;with VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near&#45;UV to visible wavelengths (3200&#45;6800&#10;AA). We report resolved H3&#45;H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.&#10;Based on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+&#45;1&#10;km/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR&#10;excess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of&#10;the parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+&#45;63 K and radius to 1.5+&#45;0.1&#10;Rj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet&#45;surface shock model&#10;implies a pre&#45;shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,&#45;40) km/s and a pre&#45;shock&#10;density of log(n0/cm^&#45;3)=14(+0,&#45;5). Pre&#45;shock velocity points to a mass of&#10;6(+8,&#45;4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary&#10;Lline&#45;Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of&#10;1.4(+2.8,&#45;0.9)x10^&#45;8 Mj/yr.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12187v1) |&#10;| Qwen2.5&#45;Coder Technical Report | Binyuan Hui, Jian Yang, Zeyu Cui, Jiaxi Yang, Dayiheng Liu, Lei Zhang, Tianyu Liu, Jiajun Zhang, Bowen Yu, Kai Dang, An Yang, Rui Men, Fei Huang, Xingzhang Ren, Xuancheng Ren, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin | &#160;&#160;In this report, we introduce the Qwen2.5&#45;Coder series, a significant upgrade&#10;from its predecessor, CodeQwen1.5. This series includes two models:&#10;Qwen2.5&#45;Coder&#45;1.5B and Qwen2.5&#45;Coder&#45;7B. As a code&#45;specific model,&#10;Qwen2.5&#45;Coder is built upon the Qwen2.5 architecture and continues pretrained&#10;on a vast corpus of over 5.5 trillion tokens. Through meticulous data cleaning,&#10;scalable synthetic data generation, and balanced data mixing, Qwen2.5&#45;Coder&#10;demonstrates impressive code generation capabilities while retaining general&#10;versatility. The model has been evaluated on a wide range of code&#45;related&#10;tasks, achieving state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art (SOTA) performance across more than 10&#10;benchmarks, including code generation, completion, reasoning, and repair,&#10;consistently outperforming larger models of the same model size. We believe&#10;that the release of the Qwen2.5&#45;Coder series will not only push the boundaries&#10;of research in code intelligence but also, through its permissive licensing,&#10;encourage broader adoption by developers in real&#45;world applications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12186v1) |&#10;| Disruption of a massive molecular cloud by a supernova in the Galactic&#10; &#160;Centre: Initial results from the ACES project | M.

Xu | &#160;&#160;The Milky Way&#39;s Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our&#10;local solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions&#10;it exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong&#10;dynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).&#10;Consequently, it is likely that there are large&#45;scale physical structures&#10;within the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we&#10;present new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array&#10;(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a&#10;multi&#45;wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the&#10;M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring&#45;like morphology. We&#10;estimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring to be 79&quot;&#10;and 154&quot;, respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre&#10;distance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $&gt; 10^{4}$ cm$^{&#45;3}$, a&#10;mass of $sim$ $10^6$ M$_odot$, and an expansion speed of $sim$ 20 km&#10;s$^{&#45;1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($&gt; 10^{51}$ erg) and&#10;momentum ($&gt; 10^7$ M$_odot$ km s$^{&#45;1}$). We discuss several possible causes&#10;for the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback&#10;and large&#45;scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the&#10;M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring is a single high&#45;energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain&#10;the observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have&#10;taken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which&#10;we now see as the M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an&#10;extreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12185v1) |&#10;| To CoT or not to CoT?

But for what kinds of&#10;tasks is this extra ``thinking&#39;&#39; really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted&#10;a quantitative meta&#45;analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own&#10;evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives&#10;strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with&#10;much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the&#10;answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the&#10;question or model&#39;s response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic&#10;operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of&#10;CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing&#10;against tool&#45;augmented LLMs. Much of CoT&#39;s gain comes from improving symbolic&#10;execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our&#10;results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance&#10;while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond&#10;prompt&#45;based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation&#10;across the whole range of LLM applications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183v1) |&#10;| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs | Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T. Chiu, Siyu Ren, Fei Yuan, Wenting Zhao, Zhiyong Wu, Alexander M. Rush | &#160;&#160;Broad textual understanding and in&#45;context learning require language models&#10;that utilize full document contexts. Due to the implementation challenges&#10;associated with directly training long&#45;context models, many methods have been&#10;proposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to&#10;differences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these&#10;approaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long&#45;context&#10;performance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a&#10;controlled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation,&#10;utilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several&#10;insights into long&#45;context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of&#10;perplexity as a general&#45;purpose performance indicator even in longer&#45;context&#10;tasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods&#10;systematically underperform across long&#45;context tasks. Finally, we confirm that&#10;exact fine&#45;tuning based methods are generally effective within the range of&#10;their extension, whereas extrapolation remains challenging.

Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate&#10;information that conflicts with real&#45;world facts, and their persuasive style&#10;can make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result,&#10;end&#45;users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with&#10;the accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all&#10;outputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore&#10;supervised finetuning on uncertainty&#45;augmented predictions as a method to&#10;develop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty.&#10;Specifically, we measure the calibration of pre&#45;trained models and then&#10;fine&#45;tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of&#10;uncertainty. Through experiments on various question&#45;answering datasets, we&#10;demonstrate that LLMs are well&#45;calibrated in assessing their predictions, and&#10;supervised finetuning based on the model&#39;s own confidence leads to&#10;well&#45;calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single&#45;claim&#10;answers.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12180v1) |&#10;| Computational Dynamical Systems | Jordan Cotler, Semon Rezchikov | &#160;&#160;We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite&#45;dimensional&#10;dynamical systems. Building off of previous work, we give definitions for what&#10;it means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine. We then&#10;show that &#39;chaotic&#39; dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and&#10;&#39;integrable&#39; dynamical systems (more generally, measure&#45;preserving systems)&#10;cannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines can&#10;be robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, we&#10;show that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable&#10;one&#45;dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and&#10;moreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt.&#10;More broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one &#39;machine&#39; to simulate&#10;another, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low&#45;complexity &#39;encoders&#39; and&#10;&#39;decoders&#39; to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system&#10;being simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical&#10;system leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity&#10;theory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12179v1) |&#10;| Poisson approximate likelihood compared to the particle filter | Yize Hao, Aaron A. Abkemeier, Edward L. Ionides | &#160;&#160;Filtering algorithms are fundamental for inference on partially observed&#10;stochastic dynamic systems, since they provide access to the likelihood&#10;function and hence enable likelihood&#45;based or Bayesian inference. A novel&#10;Poisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.&#10;(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering&#10;a fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of&#10;partially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL&#10;is the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large&#10;improvement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,&#10;based on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.&#10;(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should&#10;use PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence&#10;also reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a&#10;shortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that&#10;the comparison of log&#45;likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al. (2023) is&#10;flawed because their PAL calculations were carried out using a dataset scaled&#10;differently from the previous study. If PAL and the particle filter are applied&#10;to the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears. On simulations&#10;where the model is correctly specified, the particle filter outperforms PAL.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12173v1) |&#10;| You Only Read Once (YORO): Learning to Internalize Database Knowledge&#10; &#160;for Text&#45;to&#45;SQL | Hideo Kobayashi, Wuwei Lan, Peng Shi, Shuaichen Chang, Jiang Guo, Henghui Zhu, Zhiguo Wang, Patrick Ng | &#160;&#160;While significant progress has been made on the text&#45;to&#45;SQL task, recent&#10;solutions repeatedly encode the same database schema for every question,&#10;resulting in unnecessary high inference cost and often overlooking crucial&#10;database knowledge.

YORO significantly reduces the input&#10;token length by 66%&#45;98%. Despite its shorter inputs, our empirical results&#10;demonstrate YORO&#39;s competitive performances with traditional systems on three&#10;benchmarks as well as its significant outperformance on large databases.&#10;Furthermore, YORO excels in handling questions with challenging value&#10;retrievals such as abbreviation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12172v1) |&#10;| Ergodic properties of infinite extension of symmetric interval exchange&#10; &#160;transformations | Przemysław Berk, Frank Trujillo, Hao Wu | &#160;&#160;We prove that skew products with the cocycle given by the function&#10;$f(x)=a(x&#45;1/2)$ with $a&#10;eq 0$ are ergodic for every ergodic symmetric IET in&#10;the base, thus giving the full characterization of ergodic extensions in this&#10;family.

However,&#10;due to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across&#10;different MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In&#10;this study, we propose a novel Transformer&#45;based framework, multiPI&#45;TransBTS,&#10;which integrates multi&#45;physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.&#10;The model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi&#45;modal&#10;imaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor&#10;characteristics. The multiPI&#45;TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an&#10;Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi&#45;source, multi&#45;scale feature&#10;decoder. The encoder incorporates a multi&#45;branch architecture to separately&#10;extract modality&#45;specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module&#10;fuses information from multiple sources using channel&#45;wise and element&#45;wise&#10;attention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both&#10;common and task&#45;specific features through a Task&#45;Specific Feature Introduction&#10;(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),&#10;Tumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on&#10;the BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of&#10;multiPI&#45;TransBTS over the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methods. The model consistently&#10;achieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,&#10;highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results&#10;also indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision&#10;and recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a&#10;significant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving&#10;clinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12167v1) |&#10;| Synchrotron self&#45;Compton in a radiative&#45;adiabatic fireball scenario:&#10; &#160;Modelling the multiwavelength observations in some Fermi/LAT bursts | Nissim Fraija, P.

We show that the SSC&#10;scenario plays a relevant role in the radiative parameter $epsilon$, leading&#10;to a prolonged evolution during the slow cooling regime. In a particular case,&#10;we derive the Fermi/LAT light curves together with the photons with energies&#10;$geq$ 100 MeV in a sample of nine bursts from the second Fermi/LAT GRB catalog&#10;that exhibited temporal and spectral indices with $geq$ 1.5 and $approx$ 2,&#10;respectively. These events can hardly be described with closure relations of&#10;the standard synchrotron afterglow model, and also exhibit energetic photons&#10;above the synchrotron limit. We have modeled the multi&#45;wavelength observations&#10;of our sample to constrain the microphysical parameters, the circumburst&#10;density, the bulk Lorentz factor and the mechanism responsible for explaining&#10;the energetic GeV photons.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12166v1) |&#10;| Blind Deconvolution on Graphs: Exact and Stable Recovery | Chang Ye, Gonzalo Mateos | &#160;&#160;We study a blind deconvolution problem on graphs, which arises in the context&#10;of localizing a few sources that diffuse over networks. While the observations&#10;are bilinear functions of the unknown graph filter coefficients and sparse&#10;input signals, a mild requirement on invertibility of the diffusion filter&#10;enables an efficient convex relaxation leading to a linear programming&#10;formulation that can be tackled with off&#45;the&#45;shelf solvers. Under the&#10;Bernoulli&#45;Gaussian model for the inputs, we derive sufficient exact recovery&#10;conditions in the noise&#45;free setting. A stable recovery result is then&#10;established, ensuring the estimation error remains manageable even when the&#10;observations are corrupted by a small amount of noise. Numerical tests with&#10;synthetic and real&#45;world network data illustrate the merits of the proposed&#10;algorithm, its robustness to noise as well as the benefits of leveraging&#10;multiple signals to aid the (blind) localization of sources of diffusion. At a&#10;fundamental level, the results presented here broaden the scope of classical&#10;blind deconvolution of (spatio&#45;)temporal signals to irregular graph domains.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12164v1) |&#10;| Generalized compression and compressive search of large datasets | Morgan E. Prior, Thomas Howard III, Emily Light, Najib Ishaq, Noah M. Daniels | &#160;&#160;The Big Data explosion has necessitated the development of search algorithms&#10;that scale sub&#45;linearly in time and memory.&#10; &#160;While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently,&#10;few algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain&#45;specific.&#10; &#160;We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to&#10;perform $k$&#45;NN and $&#13;ho$&#45;NN search on compressed data while only decompressing&#10;a small, relevant, portion of the data.&#10; &#160;panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low&#45;dimensional&#10;structure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.&#10; &#160;panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between&#10;two points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in&#10;terms of the other.&#10; &#160;This property holds for many widely&#45;used distance functions, e.g. string edit&#10;distances (Levenshtein, Needleman&#45;Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures&#10;(Jaccard, Dice, etc.).&#10; &#160;We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic,&#10;and set data.&#10; &#160;We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the&#10;compressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.&#10; &#160;panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering&#10;sub&#45;linear time performance for $k$&#45;NN and $&#13;ho$&#45;NN search.&#10; &#160;We conclude that panCAKES is an efficient, general&#45;purpose algorithm for&#10;exact compressive search on large datasets that obey the manifold hypothesis.&#10; &#160;We provide an open&#45;source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming&#10;language.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12161v1) |&#10;| WeHelp: A Shared Autonomy System for Wheelchair Users | Abulikemu Abuduweili, Alice Wu, Tianhao Wei, Weiye Zhao | &#160;&#160;There is a large population of wheelchair users. Most of the wheelchair users&#10;need help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs&#10;are not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this&#10;project, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair&#10;users. A robot with a WeHelp system has three modes, following mode, remote&#10;control mode and tele&#45;operation mode. In the following mode, the robot follows&#10;the wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can&#10;ask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the&#10;wheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech&#10;recognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode.&#10;In the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy&#10;stick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs,&#10;such as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high&#10;shelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant&#10;takes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks&#10;for their needs. Our evaluation shows that the pipeline is useful and practical&#10;for wheelchair users.

These IFSs&#10;exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are&#10;topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the&#10;Blonder&#45;Tinkham&#45;Klapwijk formalism and considering normal&#45;$d$&#45;wave&#10;superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients&#10;including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and&#10;examine the validation of Widemann&#45;Franz law in the presence of both voltage&#10;and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of&#10;$d$&#45;wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the&#10;normal&#45;superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric&#10;response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in&#10;Seebeck coefficient ($sim 200,mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($sim 3.5$) due to the&#10;generation of the IFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for&#10;device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by&#10;computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice&#45;regularized&#10;version of our continuum model.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12157v1) |&#10;| JEAN: Joint Expression and Audio&#45;guided NeRF&#45;based Talking Face&#10; &#160;Generation | Sai Tanmay Reddy Chakkera, Aggelina Chatziagapi, Dimitris Samaras | &#160;&#160;We introduce a novel method for joint expression and audio&#45;guided talking&#10;face generation. Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker&#10;identity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these&#10;challenges, we propose a NeRF&#45;based network. Since we train our network on&#10;monocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn&#10;disentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio&#10;features in a self&#45;supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects.&#10;By incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned&#10;audio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle&#10;motion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer&#45;based architecture&#10;that learns expression features, capturing long&#45;range facial expressions and&#10;disentangling them from the speech&#45;specific mouth movements. Through&#10;quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can&#10;synthesize high&#45;fidelity talking face videos, achieving state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art facial&#10;expression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12156v1) |&#10;| Autopet III challenge: Incorporating anatomical knowledge into nnUNet&#10; &#160;for lesion segmentation in PET/CT | Hamza Kalisch, Fabian Hörst, Ken Herrmann, Jens Kleesiek, Constantin Seibold | &#160;&#160;Lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging is essential for precise tumor&#10;characterization, which supports personalized treatment planning and enhances&#10;diagnostic precision in oncology. However, accurate manual segmentation of&#10;lesions is time&#45;consuming and prone to inter&#45;observer variability. Given the&#10;rising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods,&#10;particularly deep&#45;learning&#45;based approaches, have become increasingly more&#10;relevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation&#10;of tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting,&#10;addressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable&#10;solutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET&#10;challenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers&#10;(FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers. To this extent, we developed a&#10;classifier that identifies the tracer of the given PET/CT based on the Maximum&#10;Intensity Projection of the PET scan. We trained two individual&#10;nnUNet&#45;ensembles for each tracer where anatomical labels are included as a&#10;multi&#45;label task to enhance the model&#39;s performance. Our final submission&#10;achieves cross&#45;validation Dice scores of 76.90% and 61.33% for the publicly&#10;available FDG and PSMA datasets, respectively.

However, a&#10;robot&#39;s ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if&#10;naively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach&#45;avoid&#10;dynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a&#10;safety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human&#39;s behavior&#10;as goal&#45;driven but conditioned on the robot&#39;s plan, enabling us to capture&#10;influence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical&#10;and belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in&#10;human behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE&#10;(Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high&#45;dimensional&#10;(39&#45;D) simulated human&#45;robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline&#10;game&#45;theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust&#10;baseline that treats the human as a worst&#45;case adversary, a safety controller&#10;that does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy&#45;function&#45;based&#10;safety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage&#10;the influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing&#10;the robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate&#10;during task execution.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12153v1) |&#10;| Decoding Style: Efficient Fine&#45;Tuning of LLMs for Image&#45;Guided Outfit&#10; &#160;Recommendation with Preference | Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan | &#160;&#160;Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding&#10;both fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper&#10;presents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large&#10;language models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their &quot;black box&quot; and static&#10;nature through fine&#45;tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item&#10;visual&#45;textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a&#10;Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style&#10;and color characteristics from human&#45;curated fashion images, forming the basis&#10;for personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine&#45;tuned on the&#10;open&#45;source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability&#10;to recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative&#10;examples is employed to enhance the LLM&#39;s decision&#45;making process. This creates&#10;a self&#45;enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in&#10;line with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore&#10;dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill&#45;in&#45;the&#45;blank,&#10;and complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework&#39;s&#10;ability to generate stylish, trend&#45;aligned outfit suggestions, continuously&#10;improving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our&#10;proposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more&#10;cohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the&#10;proposed framework&#39;s potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate&#10;suggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit&#10;generation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12150v1) |&#10;| Mechanical Wannier&#45;Stark Ladder of Diamond Spin&#45;Mechanical Lamb Wave&#10; &#160;Resonators | Philip Andrango, Hailin Wang | &#160;&#160;We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier&#45;Stark ladders of&#10;diamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with&#10;ultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin&#10;properties. Three nearest&#45;neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric&#10;configurations and a large range of coupling rates have been explored for the&#10;realization of Wannier&#45;Stark ladders of LWRs, potentially enabling long&#45;range&#10;connectivity between spin qubits through their interactions with mechanical&#10;vibrations. Additional analysis on the effects of disorder indicates that the&#10;proposed Wannier&#45;Stark ladder can be robust against realistic experimental&#10;imperfections. The development of mechanical quantum networks of spin qubits&#10;with long&#45;range connectivity can open the door to the implementation of newly&#10;developed quantum low&#45;density parity&#45;check codes in solid&#45;state systems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12149v1) |&#10;| MAgICoRe: Multi&#45;Agent, Iterative, Coarse&#45;to&#45;Fine Refinement for&#10; &#160;Reasoning | Justin Chih&#45;Yao Chen, Archiki Prasad, Swarnadeep Saha, Elias Stengel&#45;Eskin, Mohit Bansal | &#160;&#160;Large Language Models&#39; (LLM) reasoning can be improved using test&#45;time&#10;aggregation strategies, i.e., generating multiple samples and voting among&#10;generated samples. While these improve performance, they often reach a&#10;saturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM&#45;generated&#10;feedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key&#10;challenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can&#10;over&#45;correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and&#10;address errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self&#45;correct and struggle to&#10;identify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding&#10;how many iterations of refinement are needed is non&#45;trivial, and stopping too&#10;soon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose&#10;MAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty&#10;as easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse&#45;grained aggregation and hard&#10;ones with fine&#45;grained and iterative multi&#45;agent refinement. To improve error&#10;localization, we incorporate external step&#45;wise reward model (RM) scores.&#10;Moreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi&#45;agent loop with&#10;three agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on&#10;step&#45;wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure&#10;sufficient refinement, we re&#45;evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating&#10;further rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama&#45;3&#45;8B and GPT&#45;3.5&#10;and show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of&#10;MAgICoRe beats Self&#45;Consistency by 3.4%, Best&#45;of&#45;k by 3.2%, and Self&#45;Refine by&#10;4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with&#10;baselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our&#10;ablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe&#39;s RMs and multi&#45;agent&#10;communication.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147v1) |&#10;| Lempel&#45;Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka | &#160;&#160;Lempel&#45;Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string&#10;processing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into&#10;blocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence&#10;of a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another&#10;occurrence earlier in $T$. Due to numerous applications, LZ77 factorization is&#10;one of the most studied problems on strings. In the 47 years since its&#10;inception, several algorithms were developed for different models of&#10;computation, including parallel, GPU, external&#45;memory, and quantum. Remarkably,&#10;however, the complexity of the most basic variant is still not settled: All&#10;existing algorithms in the RAM model run in $Omega(n)$ time, which is a&#10;$Theta(&#10;og n)$ factor away from the lower bound of $Omega(n/&#10;og n)$&#10;(following from the necessity to read the input, which takes $Theta(n/&#10;og n)$&#10;space for $Tin{0,1}^{n}$).&#10; &#160;We present the first $o(n)$&#45;time algorithm for LZ77 factorization, breaking&#10;the linear&#45;time barrier present for nearly 50 years. For $Tin{0,1}^{n}$, our&#10;algorithm runs in $mathcal{O}(n/sqrt{&#10;og n})=o(n)$ time and uses the optimal&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og n)$ working space. Our algorithm generalizes to&#10;$Sigma=[0..sigma)$, where $sigma=n^{mathcal{O}(1)}$. The runtime and&#10;working space then become $mathcal{O}((n&#10;ogsigma)/sqrt{&#10;og n})$ and&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og_{sigma} n)$. To obtain our algorithm, we prove a more&#10;general result: For any constant $epsilonin(0,1)$ and $Tin[0..sigma)^{n}$,&#10;in $mathcal{O}((n&#10;ogsigma)/sqrt{&#10;og n})$ time and using&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og_{sigma}n)$ space, we can construct an&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og_{sigma}n)$&#45;size index that, given any $P=T[j..j+ell)$&#10;(represented as $(j,ell)$), computes the leftmost occurrence of $P$ in $T$ in&#10;$mathcal{O}(&#10;og^{epsilon}n)$ time. In other words, we solve the&#10;indexing/online variant of the LZ77 problem.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12146v1) |&#10;| Experimental Evidence That Conversational Artificial Intelligence Can&#10; &#160;Steer Consumer Behavior Without Detection | Tobias Werner, Ivan Soraperra, Emilio Calvano, David C.

In this&#10;report, we introduce Takin AudioLLM, a series of techniques and models, mainly&#10;including Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, specifically designed for&#10;audiobook production. These models are capable of zero&#45;shot speech production,&#10;generating high&#45;quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human&#10;speech and facilitating individuals to customize the speech content according&#10;to their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec&#10;language model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a&#10;multi&#45;task training framework, capable of generating high&#45;fidelity natural&#10;speech in a zero&#45;shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and&#10;timbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while&#10;advocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its&#10;naturalness and expressiveness.

Despite the plethora of studies in this domain, research&#10;on the combined methodology remains scarce, particularly in the context of&#10;Vietnamese language processing. This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDS&#10;framework leveraging a two&#45;component pipeline architecture that integrates&#10;extractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs an&#10;extractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This is&#10;achieved by a modification of the pre&#45;trained BERT network, which derives&#10;semantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet network&#10;structures. The second component utilizes the VBD&#45;LLaMA2&#45;7B&#45;50b model for&#10;abstractive summarization, ultimately generating the final summary document.&#10;Our proposed framework demonstrates a positive performance, attaining ROUGE&#45;2&#10;scores of 39.6% on the VN&#45;MDS dataset and outperforming the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art&#10;baselines.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12134v1) |&#10;| Einstein&#45;dilaton&#45;four&#45;Maxwell Holographic Anisotropic Models | Irina Ya. Aref&#39;eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov | &#160;&#160;In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the&#10;five&#45;dimensional Einstein&#45;dilaton&#45;Maxwell models has played a crucial role.&#10;Typically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while&#10;additional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A&#10;more general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field&#10;represents spatial longitudinal&#45;transverse anisotropy, while the third and&#10;fourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We&#10;consider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero&#10;temperature and five functions at non&#45;zero temperature. Maxwell field related&#10;to the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,&#10;whereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.&#10;We demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of&#10;the seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations &#45;&#45; either the&#10;dilaton or the vector potential equation &#45;&#45; follows from the Einstein equations&#10;and the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi&#10;identity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress&#45;energy&#10;tensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is&#10;provided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to&#10;three Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis&#10;shows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein&#10;equations and the equation for the vector potential&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12131v1) |&#10;| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components&#10; &#160;for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco&#45;Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram | &#160;&#160;Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data&#10;together with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal&#10;components used. It is therefore important to determine the number of&#10;significant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a&#10;variational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for&#10;estimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of&#10;samples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This&#10;eliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of&#10;principal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.&#10;This framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows&#10;and columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),&#10;and with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data&#10;with arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as&#10;cultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our&#10;method on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may&#10;underestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the&#10;synthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical&#10;dataset. These results suggest that it is broadly applicable across the life&#10;sciences.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12129v1) |&#10;| Linguini: A benchmark for language&#45;agnostic linguistic reasoning | Eduardo Sánchez, Belen Alastruey, Christophe Ropers, Pontus Stenetorp, Mikel Artetxe, Marta R. Costa&#45;jussà | &#160;&#160;We propose a new benchmark to measure a language model&#39;s linguistic reasoning&#10;skills without relying on pre&#45;existing language&#45;specific knowledge. The test&#10;covers 894 questions grouped in 160 problems across 75 (mostly) extremely&#10;low&#45;resource languages, extracted from the International Linguistic Olympiad&#10;corpus. To attain high accuracy on this benchmark, models don&#39;t need previous&#10;knowledge of the tested language, as all the information needed to solve the&#10;linguistic puzzle is presented in the context. We find that, while all analyzed&#10;models rank below 25% accuracy, there is a significant gap between open and&#10;closed models, with the best&#45;performing proprietary model at 24.05% and the&#10;best&#45;performing open model at 8.84%.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12126v1) |&#10;| From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the&#10; &#160;primordial black hole reheating scenario | Guillem Domènech, Jan Tränkle | &#160;&#160;We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs&#10;originate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight&#10;PBHs with masses $M&#10;esssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat&#10;it via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate&#10;whether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH&#10;reheating contains information about the pre&#45;PBH&#45;dominated stage, namely the&#10;initial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer&#10;functions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and&#10;isocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation&#10;of state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH&#10;dominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the&#10;spectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive&#10;to $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density&#10;fluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance&#10;as a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)&#10;observations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the&#10;initial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we&#10;find that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several&#10;future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas,&#10;especially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any&#10;early matter&#45;dominated universe scenario.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12125v1) |&#10;| Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules | Anqi Zhang, Wilson S. Geisler | &#160;&#160;Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We&#10;investigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented&#10;displays having well&#45;separated potential target&#45;object locations. Performance&#10;was compared with the Bayesian&#45;optimal decision process under the assumption&#10;that the information from the different potential target locations is&#10;statistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than&#10;optimal, despite humans&#39; substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the&#10;implausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show&#10;that three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical&#10;results. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near&#10;optimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the&#10;central potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise&#10;causes search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These&#10;findings have far&#45;reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks&#10;and other identification tasks in humans and other animals.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12124v1) |&#10;| Far&#45;from&#45;equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann&#10; &#160;approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows&#10; &#160;$v_n$ | Vincenzo Nugara, Vincenzo Greco, Salvatore Plumari | &#160;&#160;We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal&#10;system in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution&#10;function and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system&#10;sizes $R$ and interaction strength $eta/s$ and identify universality classes&#10;based upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each&#10;of this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $hat&#10;gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results&#10;highlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum&#10;moments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to&#10;a 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of&#10;different sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a&#10;similar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse&#10;flow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system&#10;size and $eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and&#10;their response functions, along with the impact of the $eta/s$ and the system&#10;transverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in&#10;momentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow&#10;$v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of&#10;large opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems&#10;evolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play&#10;in this process.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12123v1) |&#10;| Qwen2.5&#45;Math Technical Report: Toward Mathematical Expert Model via&#10; &#160;Self&#45;Improvement | An Yang, Beichen Zhang, Binyuan Hui, Bofei Gao, Bowen Yu, Chengpeng Li, Dayiheng Liu, Jianhong Tu, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin, Keming Lu, Mingfeng Xue, Runji Lin, Tianyu Liu, Xingzhang Ren, Zhenru Zhang | &#160;&#160;In this report, we present a series of math&#45;specific large language models:&#10;Qwen2.5&#45;Math and Qwen2.5&#45;Math&#45;Instruct&#45;1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the&#10;Qwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self&#45;improvement&#10;throughout the entire pipeline, from pre&#45;training and post&#45;training to&#10;inference: (1) During the pre&#45;training phase, Qwen2&#45;Math&#45;Instruct is utilized&#10;to generate large&#45;scale, high&#45;quality mathematical data. (2) In the&#10;post&#45;training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive&#10;sampling from Qwen2&#45;Math&#45;Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative&#10;evolution of data in supervised fine&#45;tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model,&#10;it&#39;s possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the&#10;next round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the&#10;ultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5&#45;Math&#45;Instruct.&#10;(3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling,&#10;optimizing the model&#39;s performance.&#10; &#160;Qwen2.5&#45;Math&#45;Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced&#10;mathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain&#45;of&#45;Thought (CoT) and&#10;Tool&#45;Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics&#10;datasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and&#10;AIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math&#10;competition problems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12122v1) |&#10;| Computing the $mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two&#45;Dimensional&#10; &#160;Strongly&#45;Correlated Systems | Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn | &#160;&#160;We show that the two&#45;dimensional $mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time&#45;reversal&#10;invariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary&#45;condition&#10;dependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non&#45;interacting and&#10;strongly&#45;correlated insulators. By introducing a family of quasi&#45;single&#10;particle states associated to the many&#45;body ground state of an insulator, we&#10;show that the $mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant can be expressed as the integral of a&#10;certain Berry connection over half the space of boundary conditions, providing&#10;an alternative expression to the formulations that appear in [Lee et al., Phys.&#10;Rev. Lett. $textbf{100}$, 186807 (2008)]. We show the equivalence of the&#10;different many&#45;body formulations of the invariant, and show how they reduce to&#10;known band&#45;theoretic results for Slater determinant ground states. Finally, we&#10;apply our results to analytically calculate the invariant for the Kane&#45;Mele&#10;model with nonlocal (orbital) Hatsugai&#45;Kohmoto (HK) interactions. This&#10;rigorously establishes the topological nontriviality of the Kane&#45;Mele model&#10;with HK interactions, and represents one of the few exact calculations of the&#10;$mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a strongly&#45;interacting system.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12120v1) |&#10;| Weak Lensing analysis of Abell 2390 using short exposures | A. Dutta, J. R. Peterson, T. Rose, M. Cianfaglione, A. Bonafede, G. Li, G. Sembroski | &#160;&#160;We present a weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 2390 at z =&#10;0.23 using second moment shape measurements made in 411 short 60s exposures.&#10;The exposures are obtained in three broadband photometric filters (g, r, i)&#10;using WIYN&#45;ODI. Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a&#10;moment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching&#10;algorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The&#10;measurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight&#10;to obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim&#10;simulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find&#10;the mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We&#10;also find the E&#45;Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic&#10;structures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical&#10;and X&#45;Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to&#10;map large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of&#10;the cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the&#10;peaks are similar to X&#45;Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster&#10;and show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12119v1) |&#10;| Low Frame&#45;rate Speech Codec: a Codec Designed for Fast High&#45;quality&#10; &#160;Speech LLM Training and Inference | Edresson Casanova, Ryan Langman, Paarth Neekhara, Shehzeen Hussain, Jason Li, Subhankar Ghosh, Ante Jukić, Sang&#45;gil Lee | &#160;&#160;Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing&#10;through audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the&#10;application of language modeling techniques to audio data. However, audio&#10;codecs often operate at high frame rates, resulting in slow training and&#10;inference, especially for autoregressive models. To address this challenge, we&#10;present the Low Frame&#45;rate Speech Codec (LFSC): a neural audio codec that&#10;leverages finite scalar quantization and adversarial training with large speech&#10;language models to achieve high&#45;quality audio compression with a 1.89 kbps&#10;bitrate and 21.5 frames per second. We demonstrate that our novel codec can&#10;make the inference of LLM&#45;based text&#45;to&#45;speech models around three times faster&#10;while improving intelligibility and producing quality comparable to previous&#10;models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12117v1) |&#10;| Stronger Baseline Models &#45;&#45; A Key Requirement for Aligning Machine&#10; &#160;Learning Research with Clinical Utility | Nathan Wolfrath, Joel Wolfrath, Hengrui Hu, Anjishnu Banerjee, Anai N. Kothari | &#160;&#160;Machine Learning (ML) research has increased substantially in recent years,&#10;due to the success of predictive modeling across diverse application domains.&#10;However, well&#45;known barriers exist when attempting to deploy ML models in&#10;high&#45;stakes, clinical settings, including lack of model transparency (or the&#10;inability to audit the inference process), large training data requirements&#10;with siloed data sources, and complicated metrics for measuring model utility.&#10;In this work, we show empirically that including stronger baseline models in&#10;healthcare ML evaluations has important downstream effects that aid&#10;practitioners in addressing these challenges. Through a series of case studies,&#10;we find that the common practice of omitting baselines or comparing against a&#10;weak baseline model (e.g. a linear model with no optimization) obscures the&#10;value of ML methods proposed in the research literature. Using these insights,&#10;we propose some best practices that will enable practitioners to more&#10;effectively study and deploy ML models in clinical settings.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12116v1) |&#10;| Revisiting Dark Photon Constraints from CMB Spectral Distortions | Jens Chluba, Bryce Cyr, Matthew C. Johnson | &#160;&#160;Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide&#10;stringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post&#45;BBN (Big&#10;Bang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models&#10;with COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.&#10;Here, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark&#10;photon conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous&#10;works only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the&#10;change to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon&#10;distortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the&#10;distortion has an opposite sign and a $simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We&#10;furthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover&#10;the redshift range $simeq 2times 10^6&#45;4times 10^7$ between the $mu$&#45;era and&#10;the end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints&#10;for dark photon masses in the range $10^{&#45;4},{&#13;m eV}&#10;esssim m_{&#13;m&#10;dp}&#10;esssim 10^{&#45;3},{&#13;m eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We&#10;demonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon&#10;to dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $mu$&#45;type distortion&#10;independent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study&#10;dark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with&#10;CMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12115v1) |&#10;| Bi&#45;objective trail&#45;planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous&#10; &#160;environment | Cory M. Simon, Jeffrey Richley, Lucas Overbey, Darleen Perez&#45;Lavin | &#160;&#160;Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in&#10;resource delivery, patrolling, information&#45;gathering, agriculture, forest fire&#10;fighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and&#10;search&#45;and&#45;rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments &#45;&#45; with e.g.&#10;rough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or&#10;capturing robots &#45;&#45; should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of&#10;risks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should&#10;take the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the&#10;team&#45;level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward&#10;from visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider&#10;bi&#45;objective trail&#45;planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a&#10;hazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed&#10;graph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of&#10;survival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a&#10;robot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for&#10;the Pareto&#45;optimal robot&#45;team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team&#10;objectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive&#10;the mission. A human decision&#45;maker can then select trail plans that balance,&#10;according to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony&#10;optimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto&#45;optimal set of&#10;robot team trail plans. As a case study, we illustrate with an&#10;information&#45;gathering mission in an art museum.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12114v1) |&#10;| Pareto Data Framework: Steps Towards Resource&#45;Efficient Decision Making&#10; &#160;Using Minimum Viable Data (MVD) | Tashfain Ahmed, Josh Siegel | &#160;&#160;This paper introduces the Pareto Data Framework, an approach for identifying&#10;and selecting the Minimum Viable Data (MVD) required for enabling machine&#10;learning applications on constrained platforms such as embedded systems, mobile&#10;devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We demonstrate that strategic&#10;data reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing&#10;bandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies&#10;Minimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource&#45;constrained&#10;environments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient&#10;practices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and&#10;overprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for&#10;optimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data&#10;representation. An experimental methodology demonstrates effective acoustic&#10;data characterization after downsampling, quantization, and truncation to&#10;simulate reduced&#45;fidelity sensors and network and storage constraints; results&#10;shows that performance can be maintained up to 95% with sample rates reduced&#10;by 75% and bit depths and clip length reduced by 50% which translates into&#10;substantial cost and resource reduction. These findings have implications on&#10;the design and development of constrained systems. The paper also discusses&#10;broader implications of the framework, including the potential to democratize&#10;advanced AI technologies across IoT applications and sectors such as&#10;agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing to improve access and multiply&#10;the benefits of data&#45;driven insights.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12112v1) |&#10;| Applications of Knowledge Distillation in Remote Sensing: A Survey | Yassine Himeur, Nour Aburaed, Omar Elharrouss, Iraklis Varlamis, Shadi Atalla, Wathiq Mansoor, Hussain Al Ahmad | &#160;&#160;With the ever&#45;growing complexity of models in the field of remote sensing&#10;(RS), there is an increasing demand for solutions that balance model accuracy&#10;with computational efficiency. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a&#10;powerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,&#10;complex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in&#10;performance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and&#10;its innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer&#10;knowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact&#10;and efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application&#10;across various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and&#10;historical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are&#10;highlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational&#10;efficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical&#10;deployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of&#10;KD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the&#10;breadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case&#10;studies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,&#10;such as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review&#10;discusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical&#10;constraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive&#10;overview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS. Through this&#10;organization, the paper not only elucidates the current state of research in KD&#10;but also sets the stage for future research opportunities, thereby contributing&#10;significantly to both academic research and real&#45;world applications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12111v1) |&#10;| It depends: Varieties of defining growth dependence | Anja Janischewski, Katharina Bohnenberger, Matthias Kranke, Tobias Vogel, Riwan Driouich, Tobias Froese, Stefanie Gerold, Raphael Kaufmann, Lorenz Keyßer, Jannis Niethammer, Christopher Olk, Matthias Schmelzer, Aslı Yürük, Steffen Lange | &#160;&#160;Many socio&#45;economic systems require positive economic growth rates to&#10;function properly. Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing&#10;evidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,&#10;these growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,&#10;more and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth&#45;dependent systems&#10;and develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of&#10;&#39;growth dependence&#39; still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,&#10;which impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article&#10;proposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the&#10;concept of &#39;growth dependence&#39; across socio&#45;economic systems. We provide a&#10;general definition consisting of four components that can be specified for&#10;different empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of&#10;measurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions&#10;or properties of the system under investigation. According to our general&#10;definition, a socio&#45;economic system is growth&#45;dependent if it requires a&#10;long&#45;term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to&#10;maintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen&#10;normative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to&#10;three areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:&#10;employment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies&#10;demonstrate that whether or not a system is growth&#45;dependent hinges not only on&#10;the empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of&#10;the concept of growth dependence. Our framework enables coherent, robust and&#10;effective definitions and research questions, fostering comparability of&#10;findings across different cases and disciplines.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12109v1) |&#10;| SPRMamba: Surgical Phase Recognition for Endoscopic Submucosal&#10; &#160;Dissection with Mamba | Xiangning Zhang, Jinnan Chen, Qingwei Zhang, Chengfeng Zhou, Zhengjie Zhang, Xiaobo Li, Dahong Qian | &#160;&#160;Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive procedure&#10;initially designed for the treatment of early gastric cancer but is now widely&#10;used for various gastrointestinal lesions. Computer&#45;assisted Surgery systems&#10;have played a crucial role in improving the precision and safety of ESD&#10;procedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognition&#10;of surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesion&#10;characteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real&#45;time&#10;surgical phase recognition algorithms. Existing surgical phase recognition&#10;algorithms struggle to efficiently capture temporal contexts in video&#45;based&#10;scenarios, leading to insufficient performance. To address these issues, we&#10;propose SPRMamba, a novel Mamba&#45;based framework for ESD surgical phase&#10;recognition. SPRMamba leverages the strengths of Mamba for long&#45;term temporal&#10;modeling while introducing the Scaled Residual TranMamba block to enhance the&#10;capture of fine&#45;grained details, overcoming the limitations of traditional&#10;temporal models like Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformers.&#10;Moreover, a Temporal Sample Strategy is introduced to accelerate the&#10;processing, which is essential for real&#45;time phase recognition in clinical&#10;settings. Extensive testing on the ESD385 dataset and the cholecystectomy&#10;Cholec80 dataset demonstrates that SPRMamba surpasses existing state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art&#10;methods and exhibits greater robustness across various surgical phase&#10;recognition tasks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12108v1) |&#10;| Who&#39;s the GOAT? Sports Rankings and Data&#45;Driven Random Walks on the&#10; &#160;Symmetric Group | Gian&#45;Gabriel P. Garcia, J. Carlos Martínez Mori | &#160;&#160;Given a collection of historical sports rankings, can one tell which player&#10;is the greatest of all time (i.e., the GOAT)? In this work, we design a&#10;data&#45;driven random walk on the symmetric group to obtain a stationary&#10;distribution over player rankings, spanning across different time periods in&#10;sports history. We combine this distribution with a notion of stochastic&#10;dominance to obtain a partial order over the players. We implement our methods&#10;using publicly available data from the Association of Tennis Professionals&#10;(ATP) and the Women&#39;s Tennis Association (WTA) to find the GOATs in the&#10;respective categories.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12107v1) |&#10;| Measuring Human and AI Values based on Generative Psychometrics with&#10; &#160;Large Language Models | Haoran Ye, Yuhang Xie, Yuanyi Ren, Hanjun Fang, Xin Zhang, Guojie Song | &#160;&#160;Human values and their measurement are long&#45;standing interdisciplinary&#10;inquiry. Recent advances in AI have sparked renewed interest in this area, with&#10;large language models (LLMs) emerging as both tools and subjects of value&#10;measurement. This work introduces Generative Psychometrics for Values (GPV), an&#10;LLM&#45;based, data&#45;driven value measurement paradigm, theoretically grounded in&#10;text&#45;revealed selective perceptions. We begin by fine&#45;tuning an LLM for&#10;accurate perception&#45;level value measurement and verifying the capability of&#10;LLMs to parse texts into perceptions, forming the core of the GPV pipeline.&#10;Applying GPV to human&#45;authored blogs, we demonstrate its stability, validity,&#10;and superiority over prior psychological tools. Then, extending GPV to LLM&#10;value measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometric&#10;methodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free&#45;form&#10;outputs, enabling context&#45;specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis of&#10;measurement paradigms, indicating response biases of prior methods; and 3) an&#10;attempt to bridge LLM values and their safety, revealing the predictive power&#10;of different value systems and the impacts of various values on LLM safety.&#10;Through interdisciplinary efforts, we aim to leverage AI for next&#45;generation&#10;psychometrics and psychometrics for value&#45;aligned AI.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12106v1) |&#10;| FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated&#10; &#160;Long&#45;Tailed Learning | Xiuhua Lu, Peng Li, Xuefeng Jiang | &#160;&#160;Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy&#10;in distributed machine learning. However, datasets distributed across each&#10;client in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can&#10;be globally aggregated, they tend to be long&#45;tailed distributed, which greatly&#10;affects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated&#10;learning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it&#10;fails to address the phenomenon of class&#45;wise bias in global long&#45;tailed data.&#10;This results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting&#10;the equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a&#10;methodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,&#10;we propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the&#10;local training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred&#10;optimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art&#10;methods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long&#45;tailed&#10;distribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR&#45;10&#45;LT and&#10;CIFAR&#45;100&#45;LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of&#10;model performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long&#45;tailed&#10;distribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12105v1) |&#10;| Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error&#10; &#160;Detection | Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia | &#160;&#160;Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real&#45;world applications. Doing&#10;so requires overcoming the noise present on today&#39;s hardware. The quantum&#10;approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling&#10;up due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup&#10;over state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art classical algorithms for some problems. However,&#10;achieving better&#45;than&#45;classical performance with QAOA is believed to require&#10;fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault&#45;tolerant&#10;implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg&#39;&#39; error detection&#10;code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the&#10;algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with&#10;up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped&#45;ion quantum computer. Additionally, we&#10;propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance, and use it&#10;to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance&#10;to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our&#10;model can be used to determine necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform&#10;Goemans&#45;Williamson algorithm on future hardware. Our results demonstrate the&#10;largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially&#10;fault&#45;tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date,&#10;paving the way towards solving real&#45;world applications with quantum computers.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12104v1) |&#10;| Cyclicity Analysis of the Ornstein&#45;Uhlenbeck Process | Vivek Kaushik | &#160;&#160;In this thesis, we consider an $N$&#45;dimensional Ornstein&#45;Uhlenbeck (OU)&#10;process satisfying the linear stochastic differential equation $dmathbf x(t) =&#10;&#45; mathbf Bmathbf x(t) dt + boldsymbol Sigma d mathbf w(t).$ Here, $mathbf&#10;B$ is a fixed $N times N$ circulant friction matrix whose eigenvalues have&#10;positive real parts, $boldsymbol Sigma$ is a fixed $N times M$ matrix. We&#10;consider a signal propagation model governed by this OU process. In this model,&#10;an underlying signal propagates throughout a network consisting of $N$ linked&#10;sensors located in space. We interpret the $n$&#45;th component of the OU process&#10;as the measurement of the propagating effect made by the $n$&#45;th sensor. The&#10;matrix $mathbf B$ represents the sensor network structure: if $mathbf B$ has&#10;first row $(b_1 &#160;, &#160;dots &#160;, &#160;b_N),$ where $b_1&gt;0$ and $b_2 &#160;, &#160;dots , b_N &#10;e 0,$ then the magnitude of $b_p$ quantifies how receptive the $n$&#45;th&#10;sensor is to activity within the $(n+p&#45;1)$&#45;th sensor. Finally, the $(m,n)$&#45;th&#10;entry of the matrix $mathbf D = frac{boldsymbol Sigma boldsymbol&#10;Sigma^text T}{2}$ is the covariance of the component noises injected into the&#10;$m$&#45;th and $n$&#45;th sensors. For different choices of $mathbf B$ and&#10;$boldsymbol Sigma,$ we investigate whether Cyclicity Analysis enables us to&#10;recover the structure of network. Roughly speaking, Cyclicity Analysis studies&#10;the lead&#45;lag dynamics pertaining to the components of a multivariate signal. We&#10;specifically consider an $N times N$ skew&#45;symmetric matrix $mathbf Q,$ known&#10;as the lead matrix, in which the sign of its $(m,n)$&#45;th entry captures the&#10;lead&#45;lag relationship between the $m$&#45;th and $n$&#45;th component OU processes. We&#10;investigate whether the structure of the leading eigenvector of $mathbf Q,$&#10;the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of $mathbf Q$ in&#10;modulus, reflects the network structure induced by $mathbf B.$&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12102v1) |&#10;| Symmetry&#45;Enriched Learning: A Category&#45;Theoretic Framework for Robust&#10; &#160;Machine Learning Models | Ronald Katende | &#160;&#160;This manuscript presents a novel framework that integrates higher&#45;order&#10;symmetries and category theory into machine learning. We introduce new&#10;mathematical constructs, including hyper&#45;symmetry categories and functorial&#10;representations, to model complex transformations within learning algorithms.&#10;Our contributions include the design of symmetry&#45;enriched learning models, the&#10;development of advanced optimization techniques leveraging categorical&#10;symmetries, and the theoretical analysis of their implications for model&#10;robustness, generalization, and convergence. Through rigorous proofs and&#10;practical applications, we demonstrate that incorporating higher&#45;dimensional&#10;categorical structures enhances both the theoretical foundations and practical&#10;capabilities of modern machine learning algorithms, opening new directions for&#10;research and innovation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12100v1) |&#10;| Brain&#45;Streams: fMRI&#45;to&#45;Image Reconstruction with Multi&#45;modal Guidance | Jaehoon Joo, Taejin Jeong, Seongjae Hwang | &#160;&#160;Understanding how humans process visual information is one of the crucial&#10;steps for unraveling the underlying mechanism of brain activity. Recently, this&#10;curiosity has motivated the fMRI&#45;to&#45;image reconstruction task; given the fMRI&#10;data from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual&#10;stimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent&#10;Diffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex&#10;visual stimuli such as high&#45;resolution natural images from vision datasets.&#10;Despite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often&#10;lack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.&#10;Consequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere&#10;visuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs&#10;effectively incorporate multi&#45;modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,&#10;and image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image&#10;generations. Specifically, inspired by the two&#45;streams hypothesis suggesting&#10;that perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain&#10;regions, our framework, Brain&#45;Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain&#10;regions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from&#10;semantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information&#10;regions, Brain&#45;Streams provides accurate multi&#45;modal guidance to LDMs. We&#10;validate the reconstruction ability of Brain&#45;Streams both quantitatively and&#10;qualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI&#10;data.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12099v1) |&#10;| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal&#10; &#160;execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huyên Pham | &#160;&#160;Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and&#10;constraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity&#10;markets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general&#10;propagator model under linear functional inequality constraints. The optimal&#10;control is given explicitly in terms of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers&#10;and their conditional expectations, as a solution to a linear stochastic&#10;Fredholm equation. We propose a stochastic version of the Uzawa algorithm on&#10;the dual problem to construct the stochastic Lagrange multipliers numerically&#10;via a stochastic projected gradient ascent, combined with a least&#45;squares Monte&#10;Carlo regression step to approximate their conditional expectations. We&#10;illustrate our findings on two different practical applications with stochastic&#10;signals: (i) an optimal execution problem with an exponential or a power law&#10;decaying transient impact, with either a `no&#45;shorting&#39; constraint in the&#10;presence of a `sell&#39; signal, a `no&#45;buying&#39; constraint in the presence of a&#10;`buy&#39; signal or a stochastic `stop&#45;trading&#39; constraint whenever the exogenous&#10;price drops below a specified reference level; (ii) a battery storage problem&#10;with instantaneous operating costs, seasonal signals and fixed constraints on&#10;both the charging power and the load capacity of the battery.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12098v1) |&#10;| Skill matching at scale: freelancer&#45;project alignment for efficient&#10; &#160;multilingual candidate retrieval | Warren Jouanneau, Marc Palyart, Emma Jouffroy | &#160;&#160;Finding the perfect match between a job proposal and a set of freelancers is&#10;not an easy task to perform at scale, especially in multiple languages. In this&#10;paper, we propose a novel neural retriever architecture that tackles this&#10;problem in a multilingual setting. Our method encodes project descriptions and&#10;freelancer profiles by leveraging pre&#45;trained multilingual language models. The&#10;latter are used as backbone for a custom transformer architecture that aims to&#10;keep the structure of the profiles and project. This model is trained with a&#10;contrastive loss on historical data.

The task of&#10;next&#45;best&#45;view (NBV) planning is to infer the pose of the next viewpoint based&#10;on the current data, and gradually realize the complete three&#45;dimensional&#10;reconstruction. Many existing algorithms, however, suffer a large computational&#10;burden due to the use of ray&#45;casting. To address this, this paper proposes a&#10;projection&#45;based NBV planning framework. It can select the next best view at an&#10;extremely fast speed while ensuring the complete scanning of the object.&#10;Specifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into&#10;ellipsoids based on the voxel structure.Then, the next best view is selected&#10;from the candidate views using a projection&#45;based viewpoint quality evaluation&#10;function in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy. This process&#10;replaces the ray&#45;casting in voxel structures, significantly improving the&#10;computational efficiency. Comparative experiments with other algorithms in a&#10;simulation environment show that the framework proposed in this paper can&#10;achieve 10 times efficiency improvement on the basis of capturing roughly the&#10;same coverage. The real&#45;world experimental results also prove the efficiency&#10;and feasibility of the framework.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12096v1) |&#10;| Undersampling effects on observed periods of coronal oscillations | Daye Lim, Tom Van Doorsselaere, Valery M. Nakariakov, Dmitrii Y. Kolotkov, Yuhang Gao, David Berghmans | &#160;&#160;Context. Recent observations of decayless transverse oscillations have shown&#10;two branches in the relationship between periods and loop lengths. One is a&#10;linear relationship, interpreted as a standing mode. The other shows almost no&#10;correlation and has not yet been interpreted conclusively. Aims. We&#10;investigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless&#10;oscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely&#10;follow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations&#10;are standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations&#10;where the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase&#10;are randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal&#10;by considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of&#10;telescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast&#10;Fourier transform. Results. When the sampling cadence is getting closer to the&#10;actual oscillation period, a tendency for overestimating periods in short loops&#10;is enhanced. The relationship between loop lengths and periods of the sampled&#10;signals shows the two branches as in the observation. Conclusions. We find that&#10;long periods of decayless oscillations occurring in short loops could be the&#10;result of undersampling.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12095v1) |&#10;| Enwrapped Perylene Bisimide Enables Room Temperature Polariton Lasing&#10; &#160;and Photonic Lattices | Dominik Horneber, Johannes Düreth, Tim Schembri, Simon Betzold, Matthias Stolte, Sven Höfling, Frank Würthner, Sebastian Klembt | &#160;&#160;Perylene bisimides (PBIs) are organic dyes with photoluminescence quantum&#10;yields (PLQY) close to unity in solution and great thermal and photo&#45;chemical&#10;stability. These features alongside the tunability of their solid&#45;state packing&#10;arrangement via chemical functionalization make this material class an&#10;excellent candidate for exciton&#45;polariton lasing at room temperature. Polariton&#10;lasing is well understood in III&#45;V semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures,&#10;however, the search for emitter materials for robust and versatile room&#10;temperature applications is ongoing. While e.g. perovskites and several organic&#10;materials have been identified to support polariton lasing, many of these&#10;materials lack tunability and long&#45;term stability under ambient conditions.&#10;Here, we fabricate optical microcavities using a strongly enwrapped PBI&#10;chromophore with prevailing monomer&#45;like absorption and emission properties in&#10;the solid state. Voluminous bay&#45;substituents prevent stacking induced&#10;PLQY&#45;quenching, thereby enabling polariton lasing at room temperature.&#10;Additionally, photonic confinement in single hemispheric resonators is&#10;demonstrated leading to localized polaritonic modes with discrete energies, as&#10;well as optical lattices revealing distinct polaritonic band&#45;structures. Due to&#10;the possibility of tunable properties by the precise control of the solid&#45;state&#10;packing arrangement of PBI emitters, our results pave the way for&#10;polarization&#45;dependent light&#45;matter coupling, including topological photonic&#10;effects within oriented crystalline thin&#45;film microcavity structures.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12093v1) |&#10;| IMRL: Integrating Visual, Physical, Temporal, and Geometric&#10; &#160;Representations for Enhanced Food Acquisition | Rui Liu, Zahiruddin Mahammad, Amisha Bhaskar, Pratap Tokekar | &#160;&#160;Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality&#10;of life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse&#10;food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents&#10;unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface&#45;level geometric&#10;information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g.,&#10;color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially&#10;when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance.&#10;We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition.&#10;Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy&#10;based on off&#45;the&#45;shelf image encoders such as ResNet&#45;50. However, such&#10;representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse&#10;acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel&#10;approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi&#45;Dimensional Representation Learning), which&#10;integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance&#10;the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach&#10;captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi&#45;solid, granular,&#10;liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and&#10;introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and&#10;assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies&#10;based on context, improving the robot&#39;s capability to handle diverse food&#10;acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach&#39;s&#10;robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations,&#10;including zero&#45;shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves&#10;improvement up to $35%$ in success rate compared with the best&#45;performing&#10;baseline.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12092v1) |&#10;| Uncovering liquid&#45;substrate fluctuation effects on crystal growth and&#10; &#160;disordered hyperuniformity of two&#45;dimensional materials | S.

Motivated by recent experiments which achieved&#10;unprecedented fast growth of large&#45;size high&#45;quality 2D crystals on liquid&#10;substrates, we uncover novel effects of liquid surfaces on microstructural&#10;ordering. We find that substrate fluctuations generate short&#45;ranged noise that&#10;speeds up crystallization and grain growth of the overlayer, surpassing that of&#10;free&#45;standing system. Coupling to the liquid substrate fluctuations can also&#10;modulate local randomness, leading to intriguing disordered structures with&#10;hidden spatial order, i.e., disordered hyperuniformity.

To navigate such environments,&#10;agents benefit from information on the various elements (e.g., buttons, text,&#10;or images) present. It remains unclear which element attributes have the&#10;greatest impact on agent performance, especially in environments that only&#10;provide a graphical representation (i.e., pixels). Here we find that the&#10;ordering in which elements are presented to the language model is surprisingly&#10;impactful&#45;&#45;randomizing element ordering in a webpage degrades agent performance&#10;comparably to removing all visible text from an agent&#39;s state representation.&#10;While a webpage provides a hierarchical ordering of elements, there is no such&#10;ordering when parsing elements directly from pixels. Moreover, as tasks become&#10;more challenging and models more sophisticated, our experiments suggest that&#10;the impact of ordering increases. Finding an effective ordering is non&#45;trivial.&#10;We investigate the impact of various element ordering methods in web and&#10;desktop environments. We find that dimensionality reduction provides a viable&#10;ordering for pixel&#45;only environments. We train a UI element detection model to&#10;derive elements from pixels and apply our findings to an agent&#10;benchmark&#45;&#45;OmniACT&#45;&#45;where we only have access to pixels.

At zero temperature for baryon chemical potentials below&#10;the mass of the Lambda baryon, only nucleons contribute to the quark density.&#10;This is different at finite temperature, where all baryons, mesons and their&#10;resonances can be excited and thus add quarks to the phase space. The&#10;probability density to find a quark inside a hadron is determined using the&#10;Yukawa ansatz of the IdylliQ model of Quarkyonic Matter. We estimate separately&#10;the magnitude of the various contributions of nucleons, Delta baryons, pions as&#10;well as further hadrons and resonances. The uncertainty in the parametrization&#10;of the probability density to find a quark inside a nucleon is spanned by&#10;assuming that at zero temperature the transition density to Quarkyonic Matter&#10;is between one and three times that of nuclear matter. Various predictions for&#10;a possible critical point associated with the chiral phase transition are found&#10;close to a triple point at which the line of the deconfinement transition and&#10;the curve associated with the transition to Quarkyonic Matter intersect. These&#10;considerations provide an estimate for the region in the QCD phase diagram&#10;where Quarkyonic Matter may be found.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12088v1) |&#10;| Towards Interpretable End&#45;Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Prediction:&#10; &#160;Utilizing Administrative Claims Data with Explainable AI Techniques | Yubo Li, Saba Al&#45;Sayouri, Rema Padman | &#160;&#160;This study explores the potential of utilizing administrative claims data,&#10;combined with advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, to&#10;predict the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to End&#45;Stage Renal&#10;Disease (ESRD).

We include a complete error budget, and we&#10;compare to two alternative approaches: non&#45;relativistic QCD and Dyson&#45;Schwinger&#10;equations, finding good agreement with the latter but not with the former.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12084v1) |&#10;| The asymptotic behavior of solutions to a doubly degenerate&#10; &#160;chemotaxis&#45;consumption system in two&#45;dimensional setting | Duan Wu | &#160;&#160;The present work proceeds to consider the convergence of the solutions to the&#10;following doubly degenerate chemotaxis&#45;consumption system begin{align*}&#10;&#10;eft{ begin{array}{r@{,}l@{quad}l@{,}c}&#10;&amp;u_{t}=&#10;ablacdotbig(u^{m&#45;1}v&#10;abla vbig)&#45;&#10;ablacdotbig(f(u)v&#10;abla&#10;vbig)+ell uv,\ &amp;v_{t}=Delta v&#45;uv, end{array}&#13;ight.%} end{align*} under&#10;no&#45;flux boundary conditions in a smoothly bounded convex domain $Omegasubset&#10;R^2$, where the nonnegative function $fin C^1([0,infty))$ is asked to&#10;satisfy $f(s)&#10;e C_fs^{al}$ with $al, C_f&gt;0$ for all $sge 1$.&#10; &#160;The global existence of weak solutions or classical solutions to the above&#10;system has been established in both one&#45; and two&#45;dimensional bounded convex&#10;domains in previous works. However, the results concerning the large time&#10;behavior are still constrained to one dimension due to the lack of a&#10;Harnack&#45;type inequality in the two&#45;dimensional case. In this note, we&#10;complement this result by using the Moser iteration technique and building a&#10;new Harnack&#45;type inequality.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12083v1) |&#10;| ReLU Surrogates in Mixed&#45;Integer MPC for Irrigation Scheduling | Bernard T. Agyeman, Jinfeng Liu, Sirish L. Shah | &#160;&#160;Efficient water management in agriculture is important for mitigating the&#10;growing freshwater scarcity crisis. Mixed&#45;integer Model Predictive Control&#10;(MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex&#10;scheduling problems in agricultural irrigation. However, the computational&#10;complexity of mixed&#45;integer MPC still poses a significant challenge,&#10;particularly in large&#45;scale applications. This study proposes an approach to&#10;enhance the computational efficiency of mixed&#45;integer MPC&#45;based irrigation&#10;schedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture&#10;dynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed&#45;integer linear&#10;representation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the&#10;mixed&#45;integer MPC&#45;based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a&#10;mixed&#45;integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed&#45;integer&#10;nonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global&#10;optimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated&#10;through comparative studies conducted on a large&#45;scale agricultural field&#10;across two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models,&#10;specifically Long Short&#45;Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used&#10;triggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU&#45;based approach significantly&#10;reduces solution times &#45;&#45; by up to 99.5% &#45;&#45; while achieving comparable&#10;performance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water&#10;Use Efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, the ReLU&#45;based approach maintains enhanced&#10;performance in terms of total prescribed irrigation and IWUE compared to the&#10;widely&#45;used triggered irrigation scheduling method.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12082v1) |&#10;| Design of Ligand&#45;Binding Proteins with Atomic Flow Matching | Junqi Liu, Shaoning Li, Chence Shi, Zhi Yang, Jian Tang | &#160;&#160;Designing novel proteins that bind to small molecules is a long&#45;standing&#10;challenge in computational biology, with applications in developing catalysts,&#10;biosensors, and more. Current computational methods rely on the assumption that&#10;the binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible,&#10;as conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon&#10;binding. In this work, we formulate proteins and molecules as unified&#10;biotokens, and present AtomFlow, a novel deep generative model under the&#10;flow&#45;matching framework for the design of ligand&#45;binding proteins from the 2D&#10;target molecular graph alone. Operating on representative atoms of biotokens,&#10;AtomFlow captures the flexibility of ligands and generates ligand conformations&#10;and protein backbone structures iteratively. We consider the multi&#45;scale nature&#10;of biotokens and demonstrate that AtomFlow can be effectively trained on a&#10;subset of structures from the Protein Data Bank, by matching flow vector field&#10;using an SE(3) equivariant structure prediction network. Experimental results&#10;show that our method can generate high fidelity ligand&#45;binding proteins and&#10;achieve performance comparable to the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art model RFDiffusionAA,&#10;while not requiring bound ligand structures. As a general framework, AtomFlow&#10;holds the potential to be applied to various biomolecule generation tasks in&#10;the future.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12080v1) |&#10;| Denoising diffusion models for high&#45;resolution microscopy image&#10; &#160;restoration | Pamela Osuna&#45;Vargas, Maren H. Wehrheim, Lucas Zinz, Johanna Rahm, Ashwin Balakrishnan, Alexandra Kaminer, Mike Heilemann, Matthias Kaschube | &#160;&#160;Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at&#10;the nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological&#10;organization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of&#10;fluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses&#10;remain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced&#10;laser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and&#10;increased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a&#10;denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high&#45;resolution&#10;images by conditioning the model on low&#45;resolution information. Additionally,&#10;the probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images&#10;that tend to further increase the signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio. We show that our model&#10;achieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously&#10;best&#45;performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly,&#10;while any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but&#10;not all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all&#10;four data sets, suggesting high generalizability.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12078v1) |&#10;| Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Via Data Pruning | Andrea Napoli, Paul White | &#160;&#160;The removal of carefully&#45;selected examples from training data has recently&#10;emerged as an effective way of improving the robustness of machine learning&#10;models. However, the best way to select these examples remains an open&#10;question. In this paper, we consider the problem from the perspective of&#10;unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). We propose AdaPrune, a method for UDA&#10;whereby training examples are removed to attempt to align the training&#10;distribution to that of the target data. By adopting the maximum mean&#10;discrepancy (MMD) as the criterion for alignment, the problem can be neatly&#10;formulated and solved as an integer quadratic program. We evaluate our approach&#10;on a real&#45;world domain shift task of bioacoustic event detection. As a method&#10;for UDA, we show that AdaPrune outperforms related techniques, and is&#10;complementary to other UDA algorithms such as CORAL. Our analysis of the&#10;relationship between the MMD and model accuracy, along with t&#45;SNE plots,&#10;validate the proposed method as a principled and well&#45;founded way of performing&#10;data pruning.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12076v1) |&#10;| The elastica sling | Alessandro Cazzolli, Francesco Dal Corso | &#160;&#160;The nonlinear mechanics of a flexible elastic rod constrained at its edges by&#10;a pair of sliding sleeves is analyzed. The planar equilibrium configurations of&#10;this variable&#45;length elastica are found to have shape defined only by the&#10;inclination of the two constraints, while their distance is responsible only&#10;for scaling the size. By extending the theoretical stability criterion&#10;available for systems under isoperimetric constraints to the case of variable&#10;domains, the existence of no more than one stable equilibrium solution is&#10;revealed. The set of sliding sleeves&#39; inclination pairs for which the stability&#10;is lost are identified. Such critical conditions allow the indefinite ejection&#10;of the flexible rod from the sliding sleeves, thus realizing an elastica sling.&#10;Finally, the theoretical findings are validated by experiments on a physical&#10;prototype. The present results lead to a novel actuation principle that may&#10;find application as a mechanism in energy harvesting, wave mitigation devices,&#10;and soft robotic locomotion.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12075v1) |&#10;| Online Refractive Camera Model Calibration in Visual Inertial Odometry | Mohit Singh, Kostas Alexis | &#160;&#160;This paper presents a general refractive camera model and online&#10;co&#45;estimation of odometry and the refractive index of unknown media. This&#10;enables operation in diverse and varying refractive fluids, given only the&#10;camera calibration in air. The refractive index is estimated online as a state&#10;variable of a monocular visual&#45;inertial odometry framework in an iterative&#10;formulation using the proposed camera model. The method was verified on data&#10;collected using an underwater robot traversing inside a pool. The evaluations&#10;demonstrate convergence to the ideal refractive index for water despite&#10;significant perturbations in the initialization. Simultaneously, the approach&#10;enables on&#45;par visual&#45;inertial odometry performance in refractive media without&#10;prior knowledge of the refractive index or requirement of medium&#45;specific&#10;camera calibration.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12074v1) |&#10;| Influence of dislocations in multilayer graphene stacks: A phase field&#10; &#160;crystal study | K. R. Elder, Zhi&#45;Feng Huang, T. Ala&#45;Nissila | &#160;&#160;In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene&#10;stacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a&#10;recently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems&#10;incorporating out&#45;of&#45;plane deformations and parameterized to match to density&#10;functional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems. The&#10;specific configuration considered consists of one monolayer containing four&#10;$5|7$ dislocations (i.e., two dislocation dipoles) sandwiched in between&#10;perfect graphene layers. The study reveals how the strain field from the&#10;dislocations in the defected layer leads to out&#45;of&#45;plane deformations that in&#10;turn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are&#10;made for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a&#10;defect&#45;free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and&#10;system size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by&#10;roughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence&#10;across the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height&#10;profiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12073v1) |&#10;| PAD&#45;FT: A Lightweight Defense for Backdoor Attacks via Data Purification&#10; &#160;and Fine&#45;Tuning | Yukai Xu, Yujie Gu, Kouichi Sakurai | &#160;&#160;Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks,&#10;particularly as recent advancements have led to increasingly subtle&#10;implantation, making the defense more challenging. Existing defense mechanisms&#10;typically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and&#10;involve retraining an auxiliary model or fine&#45;tuning the entire victim model.&#10;However, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always&#10;feasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and&#10;lightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD&#45;FT, that does not require an&#10;additional clean dataset and fine&#45;tunes only a very small part of the model to&#10;disinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a&#10;simple data purification process to identify and select the most&#45;likely clean&#10;data from the poisoned training dataset. The self&#45;purified clean dataset is&#10;then used for activation clipping and fine&#45;tuning only the last classification&#10;layer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation&#10;clipping, and classifier fine&#45;tuning, our mechanism PAD&#45;FT demonstrates&#10;superior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as&#10;confirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12072v1) |&#10;| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing&#10; &#160;data in Irish sagas | P. MacCarron | &#160;&#160;For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts&#10;in order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify&#10;similarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the&#10;significance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture&#10;requires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and&#10;often impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the&#10;network of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that&#10;the top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent&#10;with central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has&#10;been lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust&#10;to a large random removal of edges.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12071v1) |&#10;| The repetition threshold for ternary rich words | James D. Currie, Lucas Mol, Jarkko Peltomäki | &#160;&#160;In 2014, Vesti proposed the problem of determining the repetition threshold&#10;for infinite rich words, i.e., for infinite words in which all factors of&#10;length $n$ contain $n$ distinct nonempty palindromic factors. In 2020, Currie,&#10;Mol, and Rampersad proved a conjecture of Baranwal and Shallit that the&#10;repetition threshold for binary rich words is $2 + sqrt{2}/2$. In this paper,&#10;we prove a structure theorem for $16/7$&#45;power&#45;free ternary rich words. Using&#10;the structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich&#10;words is $1 + 1/(3 &#45; mu) approx 2.25876324$, where $mu$ is the unique real&#10;root of the polynomial $x^3 &#45; 2x^2 &#45; 1$.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12068v1) |&#10;| Fitting Multilevel Factor Models | Tetiana Parshakova, Trevor Hastie, Stephen Boyd | &#160;&#160;We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance&#10;given by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~cite{parshakova2023factor}. We&#10;develop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation&#45;maximization (EM)&#10;algorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of&#10;the observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and&#10;maintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved&#10;through a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive&#10;definite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of an invertible PSD MLR matrix&#10;is also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the&#10;recursive Sherman&#45;Morrison&#45;Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of&#10;the inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky&#10;factorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities,&#10;yielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement. This paper is&#10;accompanied by an open&#45;source package that implements the proposed methods.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12067v1) |&#10;| Drifts of the sub&#45;stellar points of the TRAPPIST&#45;1 planets | Revol Alexandre, Émeline Bolmont, Mariana Sastre, Gabriel Tobie, Anne&#45;Sophie Libert, Mathilde Kervazo, Sergi Blanco&#45;Cuaresma | &#160;&#160;Accurate modeling of tidal interactions is crucial for interpreting recent&#10;JWST observations of the thermal emissions of TRAPPIST&#45;1~b and c and for&#10;characterizing the surface conditions and potential habitability of the other&#10;planets in the system. Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by&#10;tidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to&#10;their proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the&#10;TRAPPIST&#45;1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In&#10;this work, we present the recent implementation of the co&#45;planar tidal torque&#10;and forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N&#45;body code&#10;Posidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using&#10;a tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of&#10;each planet by taking into account their multi&#45;layer internal structure&#10;computed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST&#45;1 planets&#10;are not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state.&#10;Planet&#45;planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and&#10;tides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a&#10;result, the sub&#45;stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and&#10;long&#45;timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with&#10;periods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12065v1) |&#10;| Quantum Magic and Multi&#45;Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei | Florian Brökemeier, S. Momme Hengstenberg, James W. T. Keeble, Caroline E. P. Robin, Federico Rocco, Martin J. Savage | &#160;&#160;Motivated by the Gottesman&#45;Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the&#10;quantum complexity of $p$&#45;shell and $sd$&#45;shell nuclei. Valence&#45;space nuclear&#10;shell&#45;model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit&#10;registers using the Jordan&#45;Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$&#45;shell and 24&#10;qubits for the $sd$&#45;shell), from which measures of the many&#45;body entanglement&#10;($n$&#45;tangles) and magic (non&#45;stabilizerness) are determined. While exact&#10;evaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of&#10;active nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex&#10;nuclei. The broadly&#45;applicable Pauli&#45;String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe&#45;) MCMC technique&#10;is introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed&#10;nuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $sim 8$ for some&#10;nuclei. Significant multi&#45;nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$&#45;shell,&#10;dominated by proton&#45;neutron configurations, along with significant measures of&#10;magic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on&#10;the path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion.&#10;These results indicate that quantum&#45;computing resources will accelerate&#10;precision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12064v1) |&#10;| Post&#45;Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a&#10; &#160;massive, rotating object | Lorenzo Iorio | &#160;&#160;The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the&#10;general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense&#45;Thirring&#10;components of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are&#10;analytically worked out to the first post&#45;Newtonian level. To the Newtonian&#10;order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as&#10;well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation&#10;in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the&#10;primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first&#10;to &#39;Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system&#10;along an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred&#10;close to the Sun&#39;s flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due&#10;to the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of&#10;microarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for&#10;the post&#45;Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)&#10;spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of&#10;the latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current&#10;(formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would&#10;bring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the&#10;predicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not&#10;changed by any of the post&#45;&#45;Keplerian accelerations considered. The&#10;calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any&#10;alternative models of gravity as well.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12063v1) |&#10;| Generalized Robot Learning Framework | Jiahuan Yan, Zhouyang Hong, Yu Zhao, Yu Tian, Yunxin Liu, Travis Davies, Luhui Hu | &#160;&#160;Imitation based robot learning has recently gained significant attention in&#10;the robotics field due to its theoretical potential for transferability and&#10;generalizability. However, it remains notoriously costly, both in terms of&#10;hardware and data collection, and deploying it in real&#45;world environments&#10;demands meticulous setup of robots and precise experimental conditions. In this&#10;paper, we present a low&#45;cost robot learning framework that is both easily&#10;reproducible and transferable to various robots and environments. We&#10;demonstrate that deployable imitation learning can be successfully applied even&#10;to industrial&#45;grade robots, not just expensive collaborative robotic arms.&#10;Furthermore, our results show that multi&#45;task robot learning is achievable with&#10;simple network architectures and fewer demonstrations than previously thought&#10;necessary. As the current evaluating method is almost subjective when it comes&#10;to real&#45;world manipulation tasks, we propose Voting Positive Rate (VPR) &#45; a&#10;novel evaluation strategy that provides a more objective assessment of&#10;performance. We conduct an extensive comparison of success rates across various&#10;self&#45;designed tasks to validate our approach.

However, the prevailing notion of paraphrase is often quite&#10;simplistic, offering only a limited view of the vast spectrum of paraphrase&#10;phenomena. Indeed, we find that evaluating models in a paraphrase dataset can&#10;leave uncertainty about their true semantic understanding. To alleviate this,&#10;we release paraphrasus, a benchmark designed for multi&#45;dimensional assessment&#10;of paraphrase detection models and finer model selection. We find that&#10;paraphrase detection models under a fine&#45;grained evaluation lens exhibit&#10;trade&#45;offs that cannot be captured through a single classification dataset.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12060v1) |&#10;| Dual&#45;Layer Training and Decoding of Large Language Model with&#10; &#160;Simultaneously Thinking and Speaking | Ningyuan Xi, Xiaoyu Wang, Yetao Wu, Teng Chen, Qingqing Gu, Jinxian Qu, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong Chen, Luo Ji | &#160;&#160;Large Language Model can reasonably understand and generate human expressions&#10;but may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have&#10;been several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but&#10;most of them are not data&#45;driven or training&#45;based. In this paper, we are&#10;motivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel&#10;model architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts&#10;and then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines&#10;to annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt&#45;response samples, then&#10;add language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We&#10;train the language model by the thoughts&#45;augmented data and successfully let&#10;the thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally&#10;output more reasonable responses. Both qualitative examples and quantitative&#10;results validate the effectiveness and performance of TaS.

To address these&#10;concerns, recent research has focused on developing zero&#45;knowledge machine&#10;learning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of&#10;ML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have&#10;substantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily&#10;optimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the&#10;substantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the&#10;model and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new&#10;Commit&#45;and&#45;Prove SNARK (CP&#45;SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that&#10;effectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML&#10;pipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white&#45;box use of the&#10;underlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic&#10;polynomial commitment and only makes black&#45;box use of the proof system. As a&#10;result, Artemis is compatible with state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art proof systems without&#10;trusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP&#45;SNARKs, evaluate&#10;their performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial&#10;improvements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover&#10;costs and maintaining efficiency even for large&#45;scale models. For example, for&#10;the VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from&#10;11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML&#10;towards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and&#10;complex ML models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12055v1) |&#10;| MMP for Enriques pairs and singular Enriques varieties | Francesco Antonio Denisi, Ángel David Ríos Ortiz, Nikolaos Tsakanikas, Zhixin Xie | &#160;&#160;We introduce and study the class of primitive Enriques varieties, whose&#10;smooth members are Enriques manifolds. We provide several examples and we&#10;demonstrate that this class is stable under the operations of the Minimal Model&#10;Program (MMP). In particular, given an Enriques manifold $Y$ and an effective&#10;$mathbb{R}$&#45;divisor $B_Y$ on $Y$ such that the pair $(Y,B_Y)$ is log&#10;canonical, we prove that any $(K_Y+B_Y)$&#45;MMP terminates with a minimal model&#10;$(Y&#39;,B_{Y&#39;})$ of $(Y,B_Y)$, where $Y&#39;$ is a $mathbb{Q}$&#45;factorial primitive&#10;Enriques variety with canonical singularities. Finally, we investigate the&#10;asymptotic theory of Enriques manifolds.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12054v1) |&#10;| Numerical renormalization group calculations for magnetic impurity&#10; &#160;systems with spin&#45;orbit coupling and crystal&#45;field effects | Aitor Calvo&#45;Fernández, María Blanco&#45;Rey, Asier Eiguren | &#160;&#160;Exploiting symmetries in the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method&#10;significantly enhances performance by improving accuracy, increasing&#10;computational speed, and optimizing memory efficiency. Published codes focus on&#10;continuous rotations and unitary groups, which generally are not applicable to&#10;systems with strong crystal&#45;field effects. The PointGroupNRG code implements&#10;symmetries related to discrete rotation groups, which are defined by the user&#10;in terms of Clebsch&#45;Gordan coefficients, together with particle conservation&#10;and spin rotation symmetries. In this paper we present a new version of the&#10;code that extends the available finite groups, previously limited to simply&#10;reducible point groups, in a way that all point and double groups become&#10;accessible. It also includes the full spin&#45;orbital rotation group. Moreover, to&#10;improve the code&#39;s flexibility for impurities with complex interactions, this&#10;new version allows to choose between a standard Anderson Hamiltonian for the&#10;impurity or, as another novel feature, an ionic model that requires only the&#10;spectrum and the impurity Lehmann amplitudes.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12050v1) |&#10;| Quantum&#45;like nonlinear interferometry with frequency&#45;engineered&#10; &#160;classical light | Romain Dalidet, Anthony Martin, Grégory Sauder, Laurent Labonté, Sébastien Tanzilli | &#160;&#160;Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic&#10;entanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits. Nonlinear&#10;optics has served as a workhorse for the generation of entangled photon pairs,&#10;ensuring both energy and phase conservation, but at the cost of limited rate&#10;and degraded signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio compared to laser&#45;based interferometry&#10;approaches. We present a &quot;quantum&#45;like&quot; nonlinear optical method that reaches&#10;super&#45;resolution in single&#45;photon detection regime. This is achieved by&#10;replacing photon&#45;pairs by coherent states of light, mimicking quantum&#10;properties through classical nonlinear optics processes. Our scheme utilizes&#10;two high&#45;brightness lasers. This results in a substantially greater&#10;signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio compared to its quantum counterpart. Such an approach&#10;paves the way to significantly reduced acquisition times, providing a pathway&#10;to explore signals across a broader range of bandwidth. The need to increase&#10;the frequency bandwidth of the quantum sensor significantly motivates the&#10;potential applications of this pathway.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12049v1) |&#10;| A Survey&#45;Based Quantitative Analysis of Stress Factors and Their Impacts&#10; &#160;Among Cybersecurity Professionals | Sunil Arora, John D. Hastings | &#160;&#160;This study investigates the prevalence and underlying causes of work&#45;related&#10;stress and burnout among cybersecurity professionals using a quantitative&#10;survey approach guided by the Job Demands&#45;Resources model. Analysis of&#10;responses from 50 cybersecurity practitioners reveals an alarming reality: 44%&#10;report experiencing severe work&#45;related stress and burnout, while an additional&#10;28% are uncertain about their condition. The demanding nature of cybersecurity&#10;roles, unrealistic expectations, and unsupportive organizational cultures&#10;emerge as primary factors fueling this crisis. Notably, 66% of respondents&#10;perceive cybersecurity jobs as more stressful than other IT positions, with 84%&#10;facing additional challenges due to the pandemic and recent high&#45;profile&#10;breaches. The study finds that most cybersecurity experts are reluctant to&#10;report their struggles to management, perpetuating a cycle of silence and&#10;neglect. To address this critical issue, the paper recommends that&#10;organizations foster supportive work environments, implement mindfulness&#10;programs, and address systemic challenges. By prioritizing the mental health of&#10;cybersecurity professionals, organizations can cultivate a more resilient and&#10;effective workforce to protect against an ever&#45;evolving threat landscape.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12047v1) |&#10;| Using Large Language Models to Generate Clinical Trial Tables and&#10; &#160;Figures | Yumeng Yang, Peter Krusche, Kristyn Pantoja, Cheng Shi, Ethan Ludmir, Kirk Roberts, Gen Zhu | &#160;&#160;Tables, figures, and listings (TFLs) are essential tools for summarizing&#10;clinical trial data. Creation of TFLs for reporting activities is often a&#10;time&#45;consuming task encountered routinely during the execution of clinical&#10;trials. This study explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate&#10;the generation of TFLs through prompt engineering and few&#45;shot transfer&#10;learning. Using public clinical trial data in ADaM format, our results&#10;demonstrated that LLMs can efficiently generate TFLs with prompt instructions,&#10;showcasing their potential in this domain. Furthermore, we developed a&#10;conservational agent named Clinical Trial TFL Generation Agent: An app that&#10;matches user queries to predefined prompts that produce customized programs to&#10;generate specific predefined TFLs.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12046v2) |&#10;| Handling Long&#45;Term Safety and Uncertainty in Safe Reinforcement Learning | Jonas Günster, Puze Liu, Jan Peters, Davide Tateo | &#160;&#160;Safety is one of the key issues preventing the deployment of reinforcement&#10;learning techniques in real&#45;world robots. While most approaches in the Safe&#10;Reinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and&#10;robot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them&#10;in complex real&#45;world settings. Instead, model&#45;based approaches that&#10;incorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning&#10;framework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on&#10;the real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot&#10;dynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task&#45;specific and hard&#10;to obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to&#10;compute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long&#45;term safety&#10;requirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe&#10;exploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus&#10;on ensuring long&#45;term safety and handling of uncertainty. Our approach is&#10;competitive or superior to state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methods in final performance while&#10;maintaining safer behavior during training.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12045v1) |&#10;| Quasiperiodic Floquet&#45;Gibbs states in Rydberg atomic systems | Wilson S. Martins, Federico Carollo, Kay Brandner, Igor Lesanovsky | &#160;&#160;Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by&#10;fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an&#10;equilibrium&#45;like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet&#45;Magnus&#10;Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi&#39;s golden rule, we show&#10;that such Floquet&#45;Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated&#10;Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab&#45;frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function&#10;of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the&#10;system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which&#10;is necessary to uphold high&#45;lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To&#10;corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five&#10;interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate&#10;numerically that the second&#45;order Floquet&#45;Gibbs state of this system is&#10;essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding&#10;Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently&#10;large.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12044v1) |&#10;| Understanding the Effects of the Baidu&#45;ULTR Logging Policy on Two&#45;Tower&#10; &#160;Models | Morris de Haan, Philipp Hager | &#160;&#160;Despite the popularity of the two&#45;tower model for unbiased learning to rank&#10;(ULTR) tasks, recent work suggests that it suffers from a major limitation that&#10;could lead to its collapse in industry applications: the problem of logging&#10;policy confounding. Several potential solutions have even been proposed;&#10;however, the evaluation of these methods was mostly conducted using&#10;semi&#45;synthetic simulation experiments. This paper bridges the gap between&#10;theory and practice by investigating the confounding problem on the largest&#10;real&#45;world dataset, Baidu&#45;ULTR. Our main contributions are threefold: 1) we&#10;show that the conditions for the confounding problem are given on Baidu&#45;ULTR,&#10;2) the confounding problem bears no significant effect on the two&#45;tower model,&#10;and 3) we point to a potential mismatch between expert annotations, the golden&#10;standard in ULTR, and user click behavior.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12043v1) |&#10;| ASR Benchmarking: Need for a More Representative Conversational Dataset | Gaurav Maheshwari, Dmitry Ivanov, Théo Johannet, Kevin El Haddad | &#160;&#160;Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable&#10;performance on widely used benchmarks such as LibriSpeech and Fleurs. However,&#10;these benchmarks do not adequately reflect the complexities of real&#45;world&#10;conversational environments, where speech is often unstructured and contains&#10;disfluencies such as pauses, interruptions, and diverse accents. In this study,&#10;we introduce a multilingual conversational dataset, derived from TalkBank,&#10;consisting of unstructured phone conversation between adults. Our results show&#10;a significant performance drop across various state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art ASR models when&#10;tested in conversational settings. Furthermore, we observe a correlation&#10;between Word Error Rate and the presence of speech disfluencies, highlighting&#10;the critical need for more realistic, conversational ASR benchmarks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12042v1) |&#10;&#10;">

First, via a substantial corpus of&#10;51,278 interview questions sourced from 888 YouTube videos of mock interviews&#10;of Indian civil service candidates, we demonstrate stark gender bias in the&#10;broad nature of questions asked to male and female candidates. Second, our&#10;experiments with large language models show a strong presence of gender bias in&#10;explanations provided by the LLMs on the gender inference task.

However, current methods often require hundreds to&#10;thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high&#45;dimensional visual&#10;observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual&#10;representations are predominantly either pretrained on out&#45;of&#45;domain data or&#10;trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present&#10;DynaMo, a new in&#45;domain, self&#45;supervised method for learning visual&#10;representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a&#10;latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of&#10;image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without&#10;augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.&#10;Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out&#45;of&#45;domain data such as Internet&#10;datasets or cross&#45;embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real&#10;environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly&#10;improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self&#45;supervised&#10;learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo&#10;hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,&#10;and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and&#10;measure its impact on downstream policy performance.

Qwen2&#45;VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,&#10;which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions&#10;into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to&#10;generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning&#10;with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary&#10;Position Embedding (M&#45;RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional&#10;information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for&#10;processing both images and videos, enhancing the model&#39;s visual perception&#10;capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2&#45;VL&#10;investigates the scaling laws for large vision&#45;language models (LVLMs). By&#10;scaling both the model size&#45;with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters&#45;and the&#10;amount of training data, the Qwen2&#45;VL Series achieves highly competitive&#10;performance. Notably, the Qwen2&#45;VL&#45;72B model achieves results comparable to&#10;leading models such as GPT&#45;4o and Claude3.5&#45;Sonnet across various multimodal&#10;benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models.

BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses&#10;and 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance&#10;of deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to&#10;integrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and&#10;performance. However, widely&#45;used C++&#45;based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,&#10;g$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries&#10;like PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of&#10;debugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we&#10;introduce an eager&#45;mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,&#10;providing PyTorch&#45;compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach&#10;includes GPU&#45;accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for&#10;2nd&#45;order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear&#10;solvers. Our eager&#45;mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency,&#10;achieving an average speedup of 18.5$times$, 22$times$, and 23$times$&#10;compared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12190v1) |&#10;| Massively Multi&#45;Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context | Felix B Mueller, Julian Tanke, Juergen Gall | &#160;&#160;Forecasting long&#45;term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of&#10;human behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input&#10;sequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby&#10;people can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene&#45;aware social&#10;transformer model (SAST) to forecast long&#45;term (10s) human motion motion.&#10;Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely&#10;varying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal&#10;convolutional encoder&#45;decoder architecture with a Transformer&#45;based bottleneck&#10;that allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model&#10;the conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We&#10;benchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to&#10;16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously.

Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon | &#160;&#160;Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a&#10;perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from&#10;fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($mu$&#45;distortion) to late&#45;time&#10;baryonic feedback processes (y&#45;distortion). While the y&#45;distortion can be&#10;detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the&#10;$Lambda$CDM&#45;predicted $mu$&#45;distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude&#10;smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a&#10;serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $mu$&#10;arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the&#10;primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k approx 1&#45;10^{4}$ Mpc$^{&#45;1}$. Here,&#10;we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly&#10;detecting $mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but&#10;with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we&#10;optimize the instrument&#39;s configuration to target $mu$ while robustly&#10;marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike&#10;Fourier&#45;transform&#45;spectrometer&#45;based designs, the specific bands and their&#10;individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing&#10;significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the&#10;$Lambda$CDM&#45;predicted $mu$&#45;distortion at $approx 5sigma$ (10$sigma$)&#10;assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission&#10;duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized&#10;configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1&#45;2000 GHz with degree&#45;scale angular&#10;resolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally&#10;measure the y&#45;distortion at sub&#45;percent precision and its relativistic&#10;correction at percent&#45;level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total&#10;thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12188v1) |&#10;| Exoplanet accretion monitoring spectroscopic survey (ENTROPY) I.&#10; &#160;Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary&#45;mass&#10; &#160;object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C.

Using the Gaia update of&#10;the parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+&#45;63 K and radius to 1.5+&#45;0.1&#10;Rj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet&#45;surface shock model&#10;implies a pre&#45;shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,&#45;40) km/s and a pre&#45;shock&#10;density of log(n0/cm^&#45;3)=14(+0,&#45;5).

This series includes two models:&#10;Qwen2.5&#45;Coder&#45;1.5B and Qwen2.5&#45;Coder&#45;7B. As a code&#45;specific model,&#10;Qwen2.5&#45;Coder is built upon the Qwen2.5 architecture and continues pretrained&#10;on a vast corpus of over 5.5 trillion tokens. Through meticulous data cleaning,&#10;scalable synthetic data generation, and balanced data mixing, Qwen2.5&#45;Coder&#10;demonstrates impressive code generation capabilities while retaining general&#10;versatility. The model has been evaluated on a wide range of code&#45;related&#10;tasks, achieving state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art (SOTA) performance across more than 10&#10;benchmarks, including code generation, completion, reasoning, and repair,&#10;consistently outperforming larger models of the same model size. We believe&#10;that the release of the Qwen2.5&#45;Coder series will not only push the boundaries&#10;of research in code intelligence but also, through its permissive licensing,&#10;encourage broader adoption by developers in real&#45;world applications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12186v1) |&#10;| Disruption of a massive molecular cloud by a supernova in the Galactic&#10; &#160;Centre: Initial results from the ACES project | M.

Xu | &#160;&#160;The Milky Way&#39;s Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our&#10;local solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions&#10;it exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong&#10;dynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).&#10;Consequently, it is likely that there are large&#45;scale physical structures&#10;within the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we&#10;present new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array&#10;(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a&#10;multi&#45;wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the&#10;M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring&#45;like morphology. We&#10;estimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring to be 79&quot;&#10;and 154&quot;, respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre&#10;distance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $&gt; 10^{4}$ cm$^{&#45;3}$, a&#10;mass of $sim$ $10^6$ M$_odot$, and an expansion speed of $sim$ 20 km&#10;s$^{&#45;1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($&gt; 10^{51}$ erg) and&#10;momentum ($&gt; 10^7$ M$_odot$ km s$^{&#45;1}$). We discuss several possible causes&#10;for the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback&#10;and large&#45;scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the&#10;M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring is a single high&#45;energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain&#10;the observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have&#10;taken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which&#10;we now see as the M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an&#10;extreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12185v1) |&#10;| To CoT or not to CoT? Chain&#45;of&#45;thought helps mainly on math and symbolic&#10; &#160;reasoning | Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett | &#160;&#160;Chain&#45;of&#45;thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting&#10;reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of&#10;tasks is this extra ``thinking&#39;&#39; really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted&#10;a quantitative meta&#45;analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own&#10;evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives&#10;strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with&#10;much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the&#10;answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the&#10;question or model&#39;s response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic&#10;operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of&#10;CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing&#10;against tool&#45;augmented LLMs. Much of CoT&#39;s gain comes from improving symbolic&#10;execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our&#10;results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance&#10;while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond&#10;prompt&#45;based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation&#10;across the whole range of LLM applications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183v1) |&#10;| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs | Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T. Chiu, Siyu Ren, Fei Yuan, Wenting Zhao, Zhiyong Wu, Alexander M. Rush | &#160;&#160;Broad textual understanding and in&#45;context learning require language models&#10;that utilize full document contexts. Due to the implementation challenges&#10;associated with directly training long&#45;context models, many methods have been&#10;proposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to&#10;differences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these&#10;approaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long&#45;context&#10;performance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a&#10;controlled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation,&#10;utilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several&#10;insights into long&#45;context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of&#10;perplexity as a general&#45;purpose performance indicator even in longer&#45;context&#10;tasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods&#10;systematically underperform across long&#45;context tasks. Finally, we confirm that&#10;exact fine&#45;tuning based methods are generally effective within the range of&#10;their extension, whereas extrapolation remains challenging. All codebases,&#10;models, and checkpoints will be made available open&#45;source, promoting&#10;transparency and facilitating further research in this critical area of AI&#10;development.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12181v1) |&#10;| Finetuning Language Models to Emit Linguistic Expressions of Uncertainty | Arslan Chaudhry, Sridhar Thiagarajan, Dilan Gorur | &#160;&#160;Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in information&#45;seeking&#10;and decision&#45;making tasks. Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate&#10;information that conflicts with real&#45;world facts, and their persuasive style&#10;can make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result,&#10;end&#45;users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with&#10;the accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all&#10;outputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore&#10;supervised finetuning on uncertainty&#45;augmented predictions as a method to&#10;develop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty.&#10;Specifically, we measure the calibration of pre&#45;trained models and then&#10;fine&#45;tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of&#10;uncertainty. Through experiments on various question&#45;answering datasets, we&#10;demonstrate that LLMs are well&#45;calibrated in assessing their predictions, and&#10;supervised finetuning based on the model&#39;s own confidence leads to&#10;well&#45;calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single&#45;claim&#10;answers.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12180v1) |&#10;| Computational Dynamical Systems | Jordan Cotler, Semon Rezchikov | &#160;&#160;We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite&#45;dimensional&#10;dynamical systems. Building off of previous work, we give definitions for what&#10;it means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine. We then&#10;show that &#39;chaotic&#39; dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and&#10;&#39;integrable&#39; dynamical systems (more generally, measure&#45;preserving systems)&#10;cannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines can&#10;be robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, we&#10;show that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable&#10;one&#45;dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and&#10;moreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt.&#10;More broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one &#39;machine&#39; to simulate&#10;another, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low&#45;complexity &#39;encoders&#39; and&#10;&#39;decoders&#39; to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system&#10;being simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical&#10;system leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity&#10;theory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12179v1) |&#10;| Poisson approximate likelihood compared to the particle filter | Yize Hao, Aaron A. Abkemeier, Edward L. Ionides | &#160;&#160;Filtering algorithms are fundamental for inference on partially observed&#10;stochastic dynamic systems, since they provide access to the likelihood&#10;function and hence enable likelihood&#45;based or Bayesian inference. A novel&#10;Poisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.&#10;(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering&#10;a fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of&#10;partially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL&#10;is the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large&#10;improvement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,&#10;based on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.&#10;(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should&#10;use PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence&#10;also reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a&#10;shortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that&#10;the comparison of log&#45;likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al. (2023) is&#10;flawed because their PAL calculations were carried out using a dataset scaled&#10;differently from the previous study. If PAL and the particle filter are applied&#10;to the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears. On simulations&#10;where the model is correctly specified, the particle filter outperforms PAL.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12173v1) |&#10;| You Only Read Once (YORO): Learning to Internalize Database Knowledge&#10; &#160;for Text&#45;to&#45;SQL | Hideo Kobayashi, Wuwei Lan, Peng Shi, Shuaichen Chang, Jiang Guo, Henghui Zhu, Zhiguo Wang, Patrick Ng | &#160;&#160;While significant progress has been made on the text&#45;to&#45;SQL task, recent&#10;solutions repeatedly encode the same database schema for every question,&#10;resulting in unnecessary high inference cost and often overlooking crucial&#10;database knowledge. To address these issues, we propose You Only Read Once&#10;(YORO), a novel paradigm that directly internalizes database knowledge into the&#10;parametric knowledge of a text&#45;to&#45;SQL model during training and eliminates the&#10;need for schema encoding during inference. YORO significantly reduces the input&#10;token length by 66%&#45;98%. Despite its shorter inputs, our empirical results&#10;demonstrate YORO&#39;s competitive performances with traditional systems on three&#10;benchmarks as well as its significant outperformance on large databases.&#10;Furthermore, YORO excels in handling questions with challenging value&#10;retrievals such as abbreviation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12172v1) |&#10;| Ergodic properties of infinite extension of symmetric interval exchange&#10; &#160;transformations | Przemysław Berk, Frank Trujillo, Hao Wu | &#160;&#160;We prove that skew products with the cocycle given by the function&#10;$f(x)=a(x&#45;1/2)$ with $a&#10;eq 0$ are ergodic for every ergodic symmetric IET in&#10;the base, thus giving the full characterization of ergodic extensions in this&#10;family. Moreover, we prove that under an additional natural assumption of&#10;unique ergodicity on the IET, we can replace $f$ with any differentiable&#10;function with a non&#45;zero sum of jumps. Finally, by considering weakly mixing&#10;IETs instead of just ergodic, we show that the skew products with cocycle given&#10;by $f$ have infinite ergodic index.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12168v1) |&#10;| multiPI&#45;TransBTS: A Multi&#45;Path Learning Framework for Brain Tumor Image&#10; &#160;Segmentation Based on Multi&#45;Physical Information | Hongjun Zhu, Jiaohang Huang, Kuo Chen, Xuehui Ying, Ying Qian | &#160;&#160;Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis,&#10;treatment planning, and monitoring the progression of brain tumors. However,&#10;due to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across&#10;different MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In&#10;this study, we propose a novel Transformer&#45;based framework, multiPI&#45;TransBTS,&#10;which integrates multi&#45;physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.&#10;The model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi&#45;modal&#10;imaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor&#10;characteristics. The multiPI&#45;TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an&#10;Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi&#45;source, multi&#45;scale feature&#10;decoder. The encoder incorporates a multi&#45;branch architecture to separately&#10;extract modality&#45;specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module&#10;fuses information from multiple sources using channel&#45;wise and element&#45;wise&#10;attention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both&#10;common and task&#45;specific features through a Task&#45;Specific Feature Introduction&#10;(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),&#10;Tumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on&#10;the BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of&#10;multiPI&#45;TransBTS over the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methods. The model consistently&#10;achieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,&#10;highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results&#10;also indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision&#10;and recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a&#10;significant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving&#10;clinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12167v1) |&#10;| Synchrotron self&#45;Compton in a radiative&#45;adiabatic fireball scenario:&#10; &#160;Modelling the multiwavelength observations in some Fermi/LAT bursts | Nissim Fraija, P. Veres, B. Betancourt Kamenetskaia, A. Galvan&#45;Gamez, M. G. Dainotti, Simone Dichiara, R. L. Becerra | &#160;&#160;Energetic GeV photons expected from the closest and the most energetic&#10;Gamma&#45;ray bursts (GRBs) provide an unique opportunity to study the&#10;very&#45;high&#45;energy emission as well as the possible correlations with lower&#10;energy bands in realistic GRB afterglow models. In the standard GRB afterglow&#10;model, the relativistic homogeneous shock is usually considered to be fully&#10;adiabatic, however, it could be partially radiative. Based on the external&#10;forward&#45;shock scenario in both stellar wind and constant&#45;density medium. We&#10;present a radiative&#45;adiabatic analytical model of the synchrotron self&#45;Compton&#10;(SSC) and synchrotron processes considering an electron energy distribution&#10;with a power&#45;law index of 1 &lt; p &lt; 2 and 2 $&#10;eq$ p. We show that the SSC&#10;scenario plays a relevant role in the radiative parameter $epsilon$, leading&#10;to a prolonged evolution during the slow cooling regime. In a particular case,&#10;we derive the Fermi/LAT light curves together with the photons with energies&#10;$geq$ 100 MeV in a sample of nine bursts from the second Fermi/LAT GRB catalog&#10;that exhibited temporal and spectral indices with $geq$ 1.5 and $approx$ 2,&#10;respectively. These events can hardly be described with closure relations of&#10;the standard synchrotron afterglow model, and also exhibit energetic photons&#10;above the synchrotron limit. We have modeled the multi&#45;wavelength observations&#10;of our sample to constrain the microphysical parameters, the circumburst&#10;density, the bulk Lorentz factor and the mechanism responsible for explaining&#10;the energetic GeV photons.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12166v1) |&#10;| Blind Deconvolution on Graphs: Exact and Stable Recovery | Chang Ye, Gonzalo Mateos | &#160;&#160;We study a blind deconvolution problem on graphs, which arises in the context&#10;of localizing a few sources that diffuse over networks. While the observations&#10;are bilinear functions of the unknown graph filter coefficients and sparse&#10;input signals, a mild requirement on invertibility of the diffusion filter&#10;enables an efficient convex relaxation leading to a linear programming&#10;formulation that can be tackled with off&#45;the&#45;shelf solvers. Under the&#10;Bernoulli&#45;Gaussian model for the inputs, we derive sufficient exact recovery&#10;conditions in the noise&#45;free setting. A stable recovery result is then&#10;established, ensuring the estimation error remains manageable even when the&#10;observations are corrupted by a small amount of noise. Numerical tests with&#10;synthetic and real&#45;world network data illustrate the merits of the proposed&#10;algorithm, its robustness to noise as well as the benefits of leveraging&#10;multiple signals to aid the (blind) localization of sources of diffusion. At a&#10;fundamental level, the results presented here broaden the scope of classical&#10;blind deconvolution of (spatio&#45;)temporal signals to irregular graph domains.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12164v1) |&#10;| Generalized compression and compressive search of large datasets | Morgan E. Prior, Thomas Howard III, Emily Light, Najib Ishaq, Noah M. Daniels | &#160;&#160;The Big Data explosion has necessitated the development of search algorithms&#10;that scale sub&#45;linearly in time and memory.&#10; &#160;While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently,&#10;few algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain&#45;specific.&#10; &#160;We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to&#10;perform $k$&#45;NN and $&#13;ho$&#45;NN search on compressed data while only decompressing&#10;a small, relevant, portion of the data.&#10; &#160;panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low&#45;dimensional&#10;structure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.&#10; &#160;panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between&#10;two points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in&#10;terms of the other.&#10; &#160;This property holds for many widely&#45;used distance functions, e.g. string edit&#10;distances (Levenshtein, Needleman&#45;Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures&#10;(Jaccard, Dice, etc.).&#10; &#160;We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic,&#10;and set data.&#10; &#160;We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the&#10;compressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.&#10; &#160;panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering&#10;sub&#45;linear time performance for $k$&#45;NN and $&#13;ho$&#45;NN search.&#10; &#160;We conclude that panCAKES is an efficient, general&#45;purpose algorithm for&#10;exact compressive search on large datasets that obey the manifold hypothesis.&#10; &#160;We provide an open&#45;source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming&#10;language.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12161v1) |&#10;| WeHelp: A Shared Autonomy System for Wheelchair Users | Abulikemu Abuduweili, Alice Wu, Tianhao Wei, Weiye Zhao | &#160;&#160;There is a large population of wheelchair users. Most of the wheelchair users&#10;need help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs&#10;are not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this&#10;project, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair&#10;users. A robot with a WeHelp system has three modes, following mode, remote&#10;control mode and tele&#45;operation mode. In the following mode, the robot follows&#10;the wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can&#10;ask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the&#10;wheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech&#10;recognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode.&#10;In the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy&#10;stick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs,&#10;such as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high&#10;shelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant&#10;takes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks&#10;for their needs. Our evaluation shows that the pipeline is useful and practical&#10;for wheelchair users.

These IFSs&#10;exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are&#10;topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the&#10;Blonder&#45;Tinkham&#45;Klapwijk formalism and considering normal&#45;$d$&#45;wave&#10;superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients&#10;including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and&#10;examine the validation of Widemann&#45;Franz law in the presence of both voltage&#10;and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of&#10;$d$&#45;wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the&#10;normal&#45;superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric&#10;response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in&#10;Seebeck coefficient ($sim 200,mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($sim 3.5$) due to the&#10;generation of the IFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for&#10;device applications.

Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker&#10;identity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these&#10;challenges, we propose a NeRF&#45;based network. Since we train our network on&#10;monocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn&#10;disentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio&#10;features in a self&#45;supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects.&#10;By incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned&#10;audio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle&#10;motion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer&#45;based architecture&#10;that learns expression features, capturing long&#45;range facial expressions and&#10;disentangling them from the speech&#45;specific mouth movements. Through&#10;quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can&#10;synthesize high&#45;fidelity talking face videos, achieving state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art facial&#10;expression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12156v1) |&#10;| Autopet III challenge: Incorporating anatomical knowledge into nnUNet&#10; &#160;for lesion segmentation in PET/CT | Hamza Kalisch, Fabian Hörst, Ken Herrmann, Jens Kleesiek, Constantin Seibold | &#160;&#160;Lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging is essential for precise tumor&#10;characterization, which supports personalized treatment planning and enhances&#10;diagnostic precision in oncology. However, accurate manual segmentation of&#10;lesions is time&#45;consuming and prone to inter&#45;observer variability. Given the&#10;rising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods,&#10;particularly deep&#45;learning&#45;based approaches, have become increasingly more&#10;relevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation&#10;of tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting,&#10;addressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable&#10;solutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET&#10;challenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers&#10;(FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers. To this extent, we developed a&#10;classifier that identifies the tracer of the given PET/CT based on the Maximum&#10;Intensity Projection of the PET scan.

However, a&#10;robot&#39;s ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if&#10;naively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach&#45;avoid&#10;dynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a&#10;safety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human&#39;s behavior&#10;as goal&#45;driven but conditioned on the robot&#39;s plan, enabling us to capture&#10;influence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical&#10;and belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in&#10;human behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE&#10;(Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high&#45;dimensional&#10;(39&#45;D) simulated human&#45;robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline&#10;game&#45;theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust&#10;baseline that treats the human as a worst&#45;case adversary, a safety controller&#10;that does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy&#45;function&#45;based&#10;safety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage&#10;the influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing&#10;the robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate&#10;during task execution.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12153v1) |&#10;| Decoding Style: Efficient Fine&#45;Tuning of LLMs for Image&#45;Guided Outfit&#10; &#160;Recommendation with Preference | Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan | &#160;&#160;Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding&#10;both fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper&#10;presents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large&#10;language models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their &quot;black box&quot; and static&#10;nature through fine&#45;tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item&#10;visual&#45;textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a&#10;Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style&#10;and color characteristics from human&#45;curated fashion images, forming the basis&#10;for personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine&#45;tuned on the&#10;open&#45;source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability&#10;to recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative&#10;examples is employed to enhance the LLM&#39;s decision&#45;making process. This creates&#10;a self&#45;enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in&#10;line with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore&#10;dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill&#45;in&#45;the&#45;blank,&#10;and complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework&#39;s&#10;ability to generate stylish, trend&#45;aligned outfit suggestions, continuously&#10;improving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our&#10;proposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more&#10;cohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the&#10;proposed framework&#39;s potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate&#10;suggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit&#10;generation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12150v1) |&#10;| Mechanical Wannier&#45;Stark Ladder of Diamond Spin&#45;Mechanical Lamb Wave&#10; &#160;Resonators | Philip Andrango, Hailin Wang | &#160;&#160;We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier&#45;Stark ladders of&#10;diamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with&#10;ultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin&#10;properties. Three nearest&#45;neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric&#10;configurations and a large range of coupling rates have been explored for the&#10;realization of Wannier&#45;Stark ladders of LWRs, potentially enabling long&#45;range&#10;connectivity between spin qubits through their interactions with mechanical&#10;vibrations. Additional analysis on the effects of disorder indicates that the&#10;proposed Wannier&#45;Stark ladder can be robust against realistic experimental&#10;imperfections. The development of mechanical quantum networks of spin qubits&#10;with long&#45;range connectivity can open the door to the implementation of newly&#10;developed quantum low&#45;density parity&#45;check codes in solid&#45;state systems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12149v1) |&#10;| MAgICoRe: Multi&#45;Agent, Iterative, Coarse&#45;to&#45;Fine Refinement for&#10; &#160;Reasoning | Justin Chih&#45;Yao Chen, Archiki Prasad, Swarnadeep Saha, Elias Stengel&#45;Eskin, Mohit Bansal | &#160;&#160;Large Language Models&#39; (LLM) reasoning can be improved using test&#45;time&#10;aggregation strategies, i.e., generating multiple samples and voting among&#10;generated samples. While these improve performance, they often reach a&#10;saturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM&#45;generated&#10;feedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key&#10;challenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can&#10;over&#45;correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and&#10;address errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self&#45;correct and struggle to&#10;identify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding&#10;how many iterations of refinement are needed is non&#45;trivial, and stopping too&#10;soon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose&#10;MAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty&#10;as easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse&#45;grained aggregation and hard&#10;ones with fine&#45;grained and iterative multi&#45;agent refinement. To improve error&#10;localization, we incorporate external step&#45;wise reward model (RM) scores.&#10;Moreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi&#45;agent loop with&#10;three agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on&#10;step&#45;wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure&#10;sufficient refinement, we re&#45;evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating&#10;further rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama&#45;3&#45;8B and GPT&#45;3.5&#10;and show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of&#10;MAgICoRe beats Self&#45;Consistency by 3.4%, Best&#45;of&#45;k by 3.2%, and Self&#45;Refine by&#10;4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with&#10;baselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our&#10;ablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe&#39;s RMs and multi&#45;agent&#10;communication.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147v1) |&#10;| Lempel&#45;Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka | &#160;&#160;Lempel&#45;Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string&#10;processing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into&#10;blocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence&#10;of a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another&#10;occurrence earlier in $T$. Due to numerous applications, LZ77 factorization is&#10;one of the most studied problems on strings. In the 47 years since its&#10;inception, several algorithms were developed for different models of&#10;computation, including parallel, GPU, external&#45;memory, and quantum. Remarkably,&#10;however, the complexity of the most basic variant is still not settled: All&#10;existing algorithms in the RAM model run in $Omega(n)$ time, which is a&#10;$Theta(&#10;og n)$ factor away from the lower bound of $Omega(n/&#10;og n)$&#10;(following from the necessity to read the input, which takes $Theta(n/&#10;og n)$&#10;space for $Tin{0,1}^{n}$).&#10; &#160;We present the first $o(n)$&#45;time algorithm for LZ77 factorization, breaking&#10;the linear&#45;time barrier present for nearly 50 years. For $Tin{0,1}^{n}$, our&#10;algorithm runs in $mathcal{O}(n/sqrt{&#10;og n})=o(n)$ time and uses the optimal&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og n)$ working space. Our algorithm generalizes to&#10;$Sigma=[0..sigma)$, where $sigma=n^{mathcal{O}(1)}$. The runtime and&#10;working space then become $mathcal{O}((n&#10;ogsigma)/sqrt{&#10;og n})$ and&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og_{sigma} n)$. To obtain our algorithm, we prove a more&#10;general result: For any constant $epsilonin(0,1)$ and $Tin[0..sigma)^{n}$,&#10;in $mathcal{O}((n&#10;ogsigma)/sqrt{&#10;og n})$ time and using&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og_{sigma}n)$ space, we can construct an&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og_{sigma}n)$&#45;size index that, given any $P=T[j..j+ell)$&#10;(represented as $(j,ell)$), computes the leftmost occurrence of $P$ in $T$ in&#10;$mathcal{O}(&#10;og^{epsilon}n)$ time. In other words, we solve the&#10;indexing/online variant of the LZ77 problem.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12146v1) |&#10;| Experimental Evidence That Conversational Artificial Intelligence Can&#10; &#160;Steer Consumer Behavior Without Detection | Tobias Werner, Ivan Soraperra, Emilio Calvano, David C.

The long&#45;standing goal of&#10;creating a predictive global model for the binding energy of a nucleus remains&#10;a significant challenge, however, and prompts the need for precise measurements&#10;of atomic masses to serve as anchor points for model developments. We present&#10;precise mass measurements of neutron&#45;rich Ru and Pd isotopes performed at the&#10;Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade facility at Argonne National&#10;Laboratory using the Canadian Penning Trap mass spectrometer. The masses of&#10;$^{108}$Ru, $^{110}$Ru and $^{116}$Pd were measured to a relative mass&#10;precision $delta m/m approx 10^{&#45;8}$ via the phase&#45;imaging&#10;ion&#45;cyclotron&#45;resonance technique, and represent an improvement of&#10;approximately an order of magnitude over previous measurements. These mass data&#10;were used in conjunction with the physically interpretable machine learning&#10;(PIML) model, which uses a mixture density neural network to model mass&#10;excesses via a mixture of Gaussian distributions.

By effectively prompting large language&#10;models (LLMs), we address spelling errors and rephrasing issues in motion&#10;retrieval. Our approach utilizes a multi&#45;part retrieval strategy to improve the&#10;generalizability of motion retrieval across the language space.

In this&#10;report, we introduce Takin AudioLLM, a series of techniques and models, mainly&#10;including Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, specifically designed for&#10;audiobook production. These models are capable of zero&#45;shot speech production,&#10;generating high&#45;quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human&#10;speech and facilitating individuals to customize the speech content according&#10;to their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec&#10;language model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a&#10;multi&#45;task training framework, capable of generating high&#45;fidelity natural&#10;speech in a zero&#45;shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and&#10;timbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while&#10;advocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its&#10;naturalness and expressiveness. Last, we propose the Takin Morphing system with&#10;highly decoupled and advanced timbre and prosody modeling approaches, which&#10;enables individuals to customize speech production with their preferred timbre&#10;and prosody in a precise and controllable manner.

However, sparse computation challenges&#10;traditional training practices, as discrete expert routing hinders standard&#10;backpropagation and thus gradient&#45;based optimization, which are the cornerstone&#10;of deep learning. To better pursue the scaling power of MoE, we introduce GRIN&#10;(GRadient&#45;INformed MoE training), which incorporates sparse gradient estimation&#10;for expert routing and configures model parallelism to avoid token dropping.&#10;Applying GRIN to autoregressive language modeling, we develop a top&#45;2&#10;16$times$3.8B MoE model. Our model, with only 6.6B activated parameters,&#10;outperforms a 7B dense model and matches the performance of a 14B dense model&#10;trained on the same data.

However, each approach has its own limitations,&#10;making it less effective to rely solely on either one. An emerging and&#10;promising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractive&#10;summarization methods. Despite the plethora of studies in this domain, research&#10;on the combined methodology remains scarce, particularly in the context of&#10;Vietnamese language processing. This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDS&#10;framework leveraging a two&#45;component pipeline architecture that integrates&#10;extractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs an&#10;extractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This is&#10;achieved by a modification of the pre&#45;trained BERT network, which derives&#10;semantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet network&#10;structures. The second component utilizes the VBD&#45;LLaMA2&#45;7B&#45;50b model for&#10;abstractive summarization, ultimately generating the final summary document.&#10;Our proposed framework demonstrates a positive performance, attaining ROUGE&#45;2&#10;scores of 39.6% on the VN&#45;MDS dataset and outperforming the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art&#10;baselines.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12134v1) |&#10;| Einstein&#45;dilaton&#45;four&#45;Maxwell Holographic Anisotropic Models | Irina Ya. Aref&#39;eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov | &#160;&#160;In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the&#10;five&#45;dimensional Einstein&#45;dilaton&#45;Maxwell models has played a crucial role.&#10;Typically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while&#10;additional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A&#10;more general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field&#10;represents spatial longitudinal&#45;transverse anisotropy, while the third and&#10;fourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We&#10;consider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero&#10;temperature and five functions at non&#45;zero temperature. Maxwell field related&#10;to the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,&#10;whereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.&#10;We demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of&#10;the seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations &#45;&#45; either the&#10;dilaton or the vector potential equation &#45;&#45; follows from the Einstein equations&#10;and the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi&#10;identity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress&#45;energy&#10;tensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is&#10;provided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to&#10;three Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis&#10;shows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein&#10;equations and the equation for the vector potential&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12131v1) |&#10;| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components&#10; &#160;for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco&#45;Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram | &#160;&#160;Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data&#10;together with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal&#10;components used. It is therefore important to determine the number of&#10;significant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a&#10;variational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for&#10;estimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of&#10;samples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This&#10;eliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of&#10;principal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.&#10;This framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows&#10;and columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),&#10;and with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data&#10;with arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as&#10;cultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our&#10;method on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may&#10;underestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the&#10;synthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical&#10;dataset. These results suggest that it is broadly applicable across the life&#10;sciences.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12129v1) |&#10;| Linguini: A benchmark for language&#45;agnostic linguistic reasoning | Eduardo Sánchez, Belen Alastruey, Christophe Ropers, Pontus Stenetorp, Mikel Artetxe, Marta R.

To attain high accuracy on this benchmark, models don&#39;t need previous&#10;knowledge of the tested language, as all the information needed to solve the&#10;linguistic puzzle is presented in the context. We find that, while all analyzed&#10;models rank below 25% accuracy, there is a significant gap between open and&#10;closed models, with the best&#45;performing proprietary model at 24.05% and the&#10;best&#45;performing open model at 8.84%.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12126v1) |&#10;| From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the&#10; &#160;primordial black hole reheating scenario | Guillem Domènech, Jan Tränkle | &#160;&#160;We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs&#10;originate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight&#10;PBHs with masses $M&#10;esssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat&#10;it via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate&#10;whether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH&#10;reheating contains information about the pre&#45;PBH&#45;dominated stage, namely the&#10;initial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer&#10;functions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and&#10;isocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation&#10;of state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH&#10;dominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the&#10;spectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive&#10;to $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density&#10;fluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance&#10;as a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)&#10;observations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the&#10;initial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we&#10;find that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several&#10;future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas,&#10;especially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any&#10;early matter&#45;dominated universe scenario.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12125v1) |&#10;| Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules | Anqi Zhang, Wilson S. Geisler | &#160;&#160;Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We&#10;investigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented&#10;displays having well&#45;separated potential target&#45;object locations. Performance&#10;was compared with the Bayesian&#45;optimal decision process under the assumption&#10;that the information from the different potential target locations is&#10;statistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than&#10;optimal, despite humans&#39; substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the&#10;implausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show&#10;that three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical&#10;results. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near&#10;optimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the&#10;central potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise&#10;causes search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These&#10;findings have far&#45;reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks&#10;and other identification tasks in humans and other animals.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12124v1) |&#10;| Far&#45;from&#45;equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann&#10; &#160;approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows&#10; &#160;$v_n$ | Vincenzo Nugara, Vincenzo Greco, Salvatore Plumari | &#160;&#160;We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal&#10;system in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution&#10;function and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system&#10;sizes $R$ and interaction strength $eta/s$ and identify universality classes&#10;based upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each&#10;of this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $hat&#10;gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results&#10;highlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum&#10;moments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to&#10;a 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of&#10;different sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a&#10;similar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse&#10;flow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system&#10;size and $eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and&#10;their response functions, along with the impact of the $eta/s$ and the system&#10;transverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in&#10;momentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow&#10;$v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of&#10;large opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems&#10;evolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play&#10;in this process.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12123v1) |&#10;| Qwen2.5&#45;Math Technical Report: Toward Mathematical Expert Model via&#10; &#160;Self&#45;Improvement | An Yang, Beichen Zhang, Binyuan Hui, Bofei Gao, Bowen Yu, Chengpeng Li, Dayiheng Liu, Jianhong Tu, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin, Keming Lu, Mingfeng Xue, Runji Lin, Tianyu Liu, Xingzhang Ren, Zhenru Zhang | &#160;&#160;In this report, we present a series of math&#45;specific large language models:&#10;Qwen2.5&#45;Math and Qwen2.5&#45;Math&#45;Instruct&#45;1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the&#10;Qwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self&#45;improvement&#10;throughout the entire pipeline, from pre&#45;training and post&#45;training to&#10;inference: (1) During the pre&#45;training phase, Qwen2&#45;Math&#45;Instruct is utilized&#10;to generate large&#45;scale, high&#45;quality mathematical data. (2) In the&#10;post&#45;training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive&#10;sampling from Qwen2&#45;Math&#45;Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative&#10;evolution of data in supervised fine&#45;tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model,&#10;it&#39;s possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the&#10;next round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the&#10;ultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5&#45;Math&#45;Instruct.&#10;(3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling,&#10;optimizing the model&#39;s performance.&#10; &#160;Qwen2.5&#45;Math&#45;Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced&#10;mathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain&#45;of&#45;Thought (CoT) and&#10;Tool&#45;Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics&#10;datasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and&#10;AIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math&#10;competition problems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12122v1) |&#10;| Computing the $mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two&#45;Dimensional&#10; &#160;Strongly&#45;Correlated Systems | Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn | &#160;&#160;We show that the two&#45;dimensional $mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time&#45;reversal&#10;invariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary&#45;condition&#10;dependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non&#45;interacting and&#10;strongly&#45;correlated insulators. By introducing a family of quasi&#45;single&#10;particle states associated to the many&#45;body ground state of an insulator, we&#10;show that the $mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant can be expressed as the integral of a&#10;certain Berry connection over half the space of boundary conditions, providing&#10;an alternative expression to the formulations that appear in [Lee et al., Phys.&#10;Rev. Lett. $textbf{100}$, 186807 (2008)]. We show the equivalence of the&#10;different many&#45;body formulations of the invariant, and show how they reduce to&#10;known band&#45;theoretic results for Slater determinant ground states. Finally, we&#10;apply our results to analytically calculate the invariant for the Kane&#45;Mele&#10;model with nonlocal (orbital) Hatsugai&#45;Kohmoto (HK) interactions. This&#10;rigorously establishes the topological nontriviality of the Kane&#45;Mele model&#10;with HK interactions, and represents one of the few exact calculations of the&#10;$mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a strongly&#45;interacting system.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12120v1) |&#10;| Weak Lensing analysis of Abell 2390 using short exposures | A. Dutta, J. R. Peterson, T. Rose, M. Cianfaglione, A. Bonafede, G. Li, G. Sembroski | &#160;&#160;We present a weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 2390 at z =&#10;0.23 using second moment shape measurements made in 411 short 60s exposures.&#10;The exposures are obtained in three broadband photometric filters (g, r, i)&#10;using WIYN&#45;ODI. Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a&#10;moment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching&#10;algorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The&#10;measurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight&#10;to obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim&#10;simulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find&#10;the mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We&#10;also find the E&#45;Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic&#10;structures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical&#10;and X&#45;Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to&#10;map large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of&#10;the cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the&#10;peaks are similar to X&#45;Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster&#10;and show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12119v1) |&#10;| Low Frame&#45;rate Speech Codec: a Codec Designed for Fast High&#45;quality&#10; &#160;Speech LLM Training and Inference | Edresson Casanova, Ryan Langman, Paarth Neekhara, Shehzeen Hussain, Jason Li, Subhankar Ghosh, Ante Jukić, Sang&#45;gil Lee | &#160;&#160;Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing&#10;through audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the&#10;application of language modeling techniques to audio data. However, audio&#10;codecs often operate at high frame rates, resulting in slow training and&#10;inference, especially for autoregressive models. To address this challenge, we&#10;present the Low Frame&#45;rate Speech Codec (LFSC): a neural audio codec that&#10;leverages finite scalar quantization and adversarial training with large speech&#10;language models to achieve high&#45;quality audio compression with a 1.89 kbps&#10;bitrate and 21.5 frames per second. We demonstrate that our novel codec can&#10;make the inference of LLM&#45;based text&#45;to&#45;speech models around three times faster&#10;while improving intelligibility and producing quality comparable to previous&#10;models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12117v1) |&#10;| Stronger Baseline Models &#45;&#45; A Key Requirement for Aligning Machine&#10; &#160;Learning Research with Clinical Utility | Nathan Wolfrath, Joel Wolfrath, Hengrui Hu, Anjishnu Banerjee, Anai N. Kothari | &#160;&#160;Machine Learning (ML) research has increased substantially in recent years,&#10;due to the success of predictive modeling across diverse application domains.&#10;However, well&#45;known barriers exist when attempting to deploy ML models in&#10;high&#45;stakes, clinical settings, including lack of model transparency (or the&#10;inability to audit the inference process), large training data requirements&#10;with siloed data sources, and complicated metrics for measuring model utility.&#10;In this work, we show empirically that including stronger baseline models in&#10;healthcare ML evaluations has important downstream effects that aid&#10;practitioners in addressing these challenges. Through a series of case studies,&#10;we find that the common practice of omitting baselines or comparing against a&#10;weak baseline model (e.g. a linear model with no optimization) obscures the&#10;value of ML methods proposed in the research literature. Using these insights,&#10;we propose some best practices that will enable practitioners to more&#10;effectively study and deploy ML models in clinical settings.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12116v1) |&#10;| Revisiting Dark Photon Constraints from CMB Spectral Distortions | Jens Chluba, Bryce Cyr, Matthew C. Johnson | &#160;&#160;Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide&#10;stringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post&#45;BBN (Big&#10;Bang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models&#10;with COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.&#10;Here, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark&#10;photon conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous&#10;works only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the&#10;change to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon&#10;distortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the&#10;distortion has an opposite sign and a $simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We&#10;furthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover&#10;the redshift range $simeq 2times 10^6&#45;4times 10^7$ between the $mu$&#45;era and&#10;the end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints&#10;for dark photon masses in the range $10^{&#45;4},{&#13;m eV}&#10;esssim m_{&#13;m&#10;dp}&#10;esssim 10^{&#45;3},{&#13;m eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We&#10;demonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon&#10;to dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $mu$&#45;type distortion&#10;independent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study&#10;dark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with&#10;CMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12115v1) |&#10;| Bi&#45;objective trail&#45;planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous&#10; &#160;environment | Cory M. Simon, Jeffrey Richley, Lucas Overbey, Darleen Perez&#45;Lavin | &#160;&#160;Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in&#10;resource delivery, patrolling, information&#45;gathering, agriculture, forest fire&#10;fighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and&#10;search&#45;and&#45;rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments &#45;&#45; with e.g.&#10;rough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or&#10;capturing robots &#45;&#45; should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of&#10;risks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should&#10;take the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the&#10;team&#45;level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward&#10;from visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider&#10;bi&#45;objective trail&#45;planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a&#10;hazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed&#10;graph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of&#10;survival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a&#10;robot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for&#10;the Pareto&#45;optimal robot&#45;team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team&#10;objectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive&#10;the mission. A human decision&#45;maker can then select trail plans that balance,&#10;according to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony&#10;optimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto&#45;optimal set of&#10;robot team trail plans. As a case study, we illustrate with an&#10;information&#45;gathering mission in an art museum.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12114v1) |&#10;| Pareto Data Framework: Steps Towards Resource&#45;Efficient Decision Making&#10; &#160;Using Minimum Viable Data (MVD) | Tashfain Ahmed, Josh Siegel | &#160;&#160;This paper introduces the Pareto Data Framework, an approach for identifying&#10;and selecting the Minimum Viable Data (MVD) required for enabling machine&#10;learning applications on constrained platforms such as embedded systems, mobile&#10;devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We demonstrate that strategic&#10;data reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing&#10;bandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies&#10;Minimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource&#45;constrained&#10;environments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient&#10;practices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and&#10;overprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for&#10;optimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data&#10;representation. An experimental methodology demonstrates effective acoustic&#10;data characterization after downsampling, quantization, and truncation to&#10;simulate reduced&#45;fidelity sensors and network and storage constraints; results&#10;shows that performance can be maintained up to 95% with sample rates reduced&#10;by 75% and bit depths and clip length reduced by 50% which translates into&#10;substantial cost and resource reduction. These findings have implications on&#10;the design and development of constrained systems. The paper also discusses&#10;broader implications of the framework, including the potential to democratize&#10;advanced AI technologies across IoT applications and sectors such as&#10;agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing to improve access and multiply&#10;the benefits of data&#45;driven insights.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12112v1) |&#10;| Applications of Knowledge Distillation in Remote Sensing: A Survey | Yassine Himeur, Nour Aburaed, Omar Elharrouss, Iraklis Varlamis, Shadi Atalla, Wathiq Mansoor, Hussain Al Ahmad | &#160;&#160;With the ever&#45;growing complexity of models in the field of remote sensing&#10;(RS), there is an increasing demand for solutions that balance model accuracy&#10;with computational efficiency. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a&#10;powerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,&#10;complex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in&#10;performance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and&#10;its innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer&#10;knowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact&#10;and efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application&#10;across various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and&#10;historical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are&#10;highlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational&#10;efficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical&#10;deployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of&#10;KD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the&#10;breadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case&#10;studies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,&#10;such as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review&#10;discusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical&#10;constraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive&#10;overview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS. Through this&#10;organization, the paper not only elucidates the current state of research in KD&#10;but also sets the stage for future research opportunities, thereby contributing&#10;significantly to both academic research and real&#45;world applications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12111v1) |&#10;| It depends: Varieties of defining growth dependence | Anja Janischewski, Katharina Bohnenberger, Matthias Kranke, Tobias Vogel, Riwan Driouich, Tobias Froese, Stefanie Gerold, Raphael Kaufmann, Lorenz Keyßer, Jannis Niethammer, Christopher Olk, Matthias Schmelzer, Aslı Yürük, Steffen Lange | &#160;&#160;Many socio&#45;economic systems require positive economic growth rates to&#10;function properly. Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing&#10;evidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,&#10;these growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,&#10;more and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth&#45;dependent systems&#10;and develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of&#10;&#39;growth dependence&#39; still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,&#10;which impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article&#10;proposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the&#10;concept of &#39;growth dependence&#39; across socio&#45;economic systems. We provide a&#10;general definition consisting of four components that can be specified for&#10;different empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of&#10;measurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions&#10;or properties of the system under investigation. According to our general&#10;definition, a socio&#45;economic system is growth&#45;dependent if it requires a&#10;long&#45;term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to&#10;maintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen&#10;normative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to&#10;three areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:&#10;employment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies&#10;demonstrate that whether or not a system is growth&#45;dependent hinges not only on&#10;the empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of&#10;the concept of growth dependence. Our framework enables coherent, robust and&#10;effective definitions and research questions, fostering comparability of&#10;findings across different cases and disciplines.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12109v1) |&#10;| SPRMamba: Surgical Phase Recognition for Endoscopic Submucosal&#10; &#160;Dissection with Mamba | Xiangning Zhang, Jinnan Chen, Qingwei Zhang, Chengfeng Zhou, Zhengjie Zhang, Xiaobo Li, Dahong Qian | &#160;&#160;Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive procedure&#10;initially designed for the treatment of early gastric cancer but is now widely&#10;used for various gastrointestinal lesions. Computer&#45;assisted Surgery systems&#10;have played a crucial role in improving the precision and safety of ESD&#10;procedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognition&#10;of surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesion&#10;characteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real&#45;time&#10;surgical phase recognition algorithms. Existing surgical phase recognition&#10;algorithms struggle to efficiently capture temporal contexts in video&#45;based&#10;scenarios, leading to insufficient performance. To address these issues, we&#10;propose SPRMamba, a novel Mamba&#45;based framework for ESD surgical phase&#10;recognition. SPRMamba leverages the strengths of Mamba for long&#45;term temporal&#10;modeling while introducing the Scaled Residual TranMamba block to enhance the&#10;capture of fine&#45;grained details, overcoming the limitations of traditional&#10;temporal models like Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformers.&#10;Moreover, a Temporal Sample Strategy is introduced to accelerate the&#10;processing, which is essential for real&#45;time phase recognition in clinical&#10;settings. Extensive testing on the ESD385 dataset and the cholecystectomy&#10;Cholec80 dataset demonstrates that SPRMamba surpasses existing state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art&#10;methods and exhibits greater robustness across various surgical phase&#10;recognition tasks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12108v1) |&#10;| Who&#39;s the GOAT? Sports Rankings and Data&#45;Driven Random Walks on the&#10; &#160;Symmetric Group | Gian&#45;Gabriel P. Garcia, J. Carlos Martínez Mori | &#160;&#160;Given a collection of historical sports rankings, can one tell which player&#10;is the greatest of all time (i.e., the GOAT)? In this work, we design a&#10;data&#45;driven random walk on the symmetric group to obtain a stationary&#10;distribution over player rankings, spanning across different time periods in&#10;sports history. We combine this distribution with a notion of stochastic&#10;dominance to obtain a partial order over the players. We implement our methods&#10;using publicly available data from the Association of Tennis Professionals&#10;(ATP) and the Women&#39;s Tennis Association (WTA) to find the GOATs in the&#10;respective categories.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12107v1) |&#10;| Measuring Human and AI Values based on Generative Psychometrics with&#10; &#160;Large Language Models | Haoran Ye, Yuhang Xie, Yuanyi Ren, Hanjun Fang, Xin Zhang, Guojie Song | &#160;&#160;Human values and their measurement are long&#45;standing interdisciplinary&#10;inquiry. Recent advances in AI have sparked renewed interest in this area, with&#10;large language models (LLMs) emerging as both tools and subjects of value&#10;measurement. This work introduces Generative Psychometrics for Values (GPV), an&#10;LLM&#45;based, data&#45;driven value measurement paradigm, theoretically grounded in&#10;text&#45;revealed selective perceptions. We begin by fine&#45;tuning an LLM for&#10;accurate perception&#45;level value measurement and verifying the capability of&#10;LLMs to parse texts into perceptions, forming the core of the GPV pipeline.&#10;Applying GPV to human&#45;authored blogs, we demonstrate its stability, validity,&#10;and superiority over prior psychological tools. Then, extending GPV to LLM&#10;value measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometric&#10;methodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free&#45;form&#10;outputs, enabling context&#45;specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis of&#10;measurement paradigms, indicating response biases of prior methods; and 3) an&#10;attempt to bridge LLM values and their safety, revealing the predictive power&#10;of different value systems and the impacts of various values on LLM safety.&#10;Through interdisciplinary efforts, we aim to leverage AI for next&#45;generation&#10;psychometrics and psychometrics for value&#45;aligned AI.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12106v1) |&#10;| FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated&#10; &#160;Long&#45;Tailed Learning | Xiuhua Lu, Peng Li, Xuefeng Jiang | &#160;&#160;Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy&#10;in distributed machine learning. However, datasets distributed across each&#10;client in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can&#10;be globally aggregated, they tend to be long&#45;tailed distributed, which greatly&#10;affects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated&#10;learning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it&#10;fails to address the phenomenon of class&#45;wise bias in global long&#45;tailed data.&#10;This results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting&#10;the equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a&#10;methodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,&#10;we propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the&#10;local training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred&#10;optimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art&#10;methods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long&#45;tailed&#10;distribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR&#45;10&#45;LT and&#10;CIFAR&#45;100&#45;LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of&#10;model performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long&#45;tailed&#10;distribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12105v1) |&#10;| Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error&#10; &#160;Detection | Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia | &#160;&#160;Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real&#45;world applications. Doing&#10;so requires overcoming the noise present on today&#39;s hardware. The quantum&#10;approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling&#10;up due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup&#10;over state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art classical algorithms for some problems. However,&#10;achieving better&#45;than&#45;classical performance with QAOA is believed to require&#10;fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault&#45;tolerant&#10;implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg&#39;&#39; error detection&#10;code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the&#10;algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with&#10;up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped&#45;ion quantum computer. Additionally, we&#10;propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance, and use it&#10;to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance&#10;to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our&#10;model can be used to determine necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform&#10;Goemans&#45;Williamson algorithm on future hardware. Our results demonstrate the&#10;largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially&#10;fault&#45;tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date,&#10;paving the way towards solving real&#45;world applications with quantum computers.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12104v1) |&#10;| Cyclicity Analysis of the Ornstein&#45;Uhlenbeck Process | Vivek Kaushik | &#160;&#160;In this thesis, we consider an $N$&#45;dimensional Ornstein&#45;Uhlenbeck (OU)&#10;process satisfying the linear stochastic differential equation $dmathbf x(t) =&#10;&#45; mathbf Bmathbf x(t) dt + boldsymbol Sigma d mathbf w(t).$ Here, $mathbf&#10;B$ is a fixed $N times N$ circulant friction matrix whose eigenvalues have&#10;positive real parts, $boldsymbol Sigma$ is a fixed $N times M$ matrix. We&#10;consider a signal propagation model governed by this OU process. In this model,&#10;an underlying signal propagates throughout a network consisting of $N$ linked&#10;sensors located in space. We interpret the $n$&#45;th component of the OU process&#10;as the measurement of the propagating effect made by the $n$&#45;th sensor. The&#10;matrix $mathbf B$ represents the sensor network structure: if $mathbf B$ has&#10;first row $(b_1 &#160;, &#160;dots &#160;, &#160;b_N),$ where $b_1&gt;0$ and $b_2 &#160;, &#160;dots , b_N &#10;e 0,$ then the magnitude of $b_p$ quantifies how receptive the $n$&#45;th&#10;sensor is to activity within the $(n+p&#45;1)$&#45;th sensor. Finally, the $(m,n)$&#45;th&#10;entry of the matrix $mathbf D = frac{boldsymbol Sigma boldsymbol&#10;Sigma^text T}{2}$ is the covariance of the component noises injected into the&#10;$m$&#45;th and $n$&#45;th sensors. For different choices of $mathbf B$ and&#10;$boldsymbol Sigma,$ we investigate whether Cyclicity Analysis enables us to&#10;recover the structure of network. Roughly speaking, Cyclicity Analysis studies&#10;the lead&#45;lag dynamics pertaining to the components of a multivariate signal. We&#10;specifically consider an $N times N$ skew&#45;symmetric matrix $mathbf Q,$ known&#10;as the lead matrix, in which the sign of its $(m,n)$&#45;th entry captures the&#10;lead&#45;lag relationship between the $m$&#45;th and $n$&#45;th component OU processes.

Through rigorous proofs and&#10;practical applications, we demonstrate that incorporating higher&#45;dimensional&#10;categorical structures enhances both the theoretical foundations and practical&#10;capabilities of modern machine learning algorithms, opening new directions for&#10;research and innovation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12100v1) |&#10;| Brain&#45;Streams: fMRI&#45;to&#45;Image Reconstruction with Multi&#45;modal Guidance | Jaehoon Joo, Taejin Jeong, Seongjae Hwang | &#160;&#160;Understanding how humans process visual information is one of the crucial&#10;steps for unraveling the underlying mechanism of brain activity. Recently, this&#10;curiosity has motivated the fMRI&#45;to&#45;image reconstruction task; given the fMRI&#10;data from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual&#10;stimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent&#10;Diffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex&#10;visual stimuli such as high&#45;resolution natural images from vision datasets.&#10;Despite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often&#10;lack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.&#10;Consequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere&#10;visuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs&#10;effectively incorporate multi&#45;modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,&#10;and image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image&#10;generations. Specifically, inspired by the two&#45;streams hypothesis suggesting&#10;that perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain&#10;regions, our framework, Brain&#45;Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain&#10;regions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from&#10;semantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information&#10;regions, Brain&#45;Streams provides accurate multi&#45;modal guidance to LDMs. We&#10;validate the reconstruction ability of Brain&#45;Streams both quantitatively and&#10;qualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI&#10;data.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12099v1) |&#10;| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal&#10; &#160;execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huyên Pham | &#160;&#160;Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and&#10;constraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity&#10;markets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general&#10;propagator model under linear functional inequality constraints. The optimal&#10;control is given explicitly in terms of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers&#10;and their conditional expectations, as a solution to a linear stochastic&#10;Fredholm equation. We propose a stochastic version of the Uzawa algorithm on&#10;the dual problem to construct the stochastic Lagrange multipliers numerically&#10;via a stochastic projected gradient ascent, combined with a least&#45;squares Monte&#10;Carlo regression step to approximate their conditional expectations. We&#10;illustrate our findings on two different practical applications with stochastic&#10;signals: (i) an optimal execution problem with an exponential or a power law&#10;decaying transient impact, with either a `no&#45;shorting&#39; constraint in the&#10;presence of a `sell&#39; signal, a `no&#45;buying&#39; constraint in the presence of a&#10;`buy&#39; signal or a stochastic `stop&#45;trading&#39; constraint whenever the exogenous&#10;price drops below a specified reference level; (ii) a battery storage problem&#10;with instantaneous operating costs, seasonal signals and fixed constraints on&#10;both the charging power and the load capacity of the battery.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12098v1) |&#10;| Skill matching at scale: freelancer&#45;project alignment for efficient&#10; &#160;multilingual candidate retrieval | Warren Jouanneau, Marc Palyart, Emma Jouffroy | &#160;&#160;Finding the perfect match between a job proposal and a set of freelancers is&#10;not an easy task to perform at scale, especially in multiple languages. In this&#10;paper, we propose a novel neural retriever architecture that tackles this&#10;problem in a multilingual setting. Our method encodes project descriptions and&#10;freelancer profiles by leveraging pre&#45;trained multilingual language models. The&#10;latter are used as backbone for a custom transformer architecture that aims to&#10;keep the structure of the profiles and project. This model is trained with a&#10;contrastive loss on historical data. Thanks to several experiments, we show&#10;that this approach effectively captures skill matching similarity and&#10;facilitates efficient matching, outperforming traditional methods.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12097v2) |&#10;| An Efficient Projection&#45;Based Next&#45;best&#45;view Planning Framework for&#10; &#160;Reconstruction of Unknown Objects | Zhizhou Jia, Shaohui Zhang, Qun Hao | &#160;&#160;Efficiently and completely capturing the three&#45;dimensional data of an object&#10;is a fundamental problem in industrial and robotic applications. The task of&#10;next&#45;best&#45;view (NBV) planning is to infer the pose of the next viewpoint based&#10;on the current data, and gradually realize the complete three&#45;dimensional&#10;reconstruction. Many existing algorithms, however, suffer a large computational&#10;burden due to the use of ray&#45;casting. To address this, this paper proposes a&#10;projection&#45;based NBV planning framework. It can select the next best view at an&#10;extremely fast speed while ensuring the complete scanning of the object.&#10;Specifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into&#10;ellipsoids based on the voxel structure.Then, the next best view is selected&#10;from the candidate views using a projection&#45;based viewpoint quality evaluation&#10;function in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy. This process&#10;replaces the ray&#45;casting in voxel structures, significantly improving the&#10;computational efficiency. Comparative experiments with other algorithms in a&#10;simulation environment show that the framework proposed in this paper can&#10;achieve 10 times efficiency improvement on the basis of capturing roughly the&#10;same coverage. The real&#45;world experimental results also prove the efficiency&#10;and feasibility of the framework.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12096v1) |&#10;| Undersampling effects on observed periods of coronal oscillations | Daye Lim, Tom Van Doorsselaere, Valery M. Nakariakov, Dmitrii Y. Kolotkov, Yuhang Gao, David Berghmans | &#160;&#160;Context. Recent observations of decayless transverse oscillations have shown&#10;two branches in the relationship between periods and loop lengths. One is a&#10;linear relationship, interpreted as a standing mode. The other shows almost no&#10;correlation and has not yet been interpreted conclusively. Aims. We&#10;investigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless&#10;oscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely&#10;follow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations&#10;are standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations&#10;where the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase&#10;are randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal&#10;by considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of&#10;telescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast&#10;Fourier transform. Results. When the sampling cadence is getting closer to the&#10;actual oscillation period, a tendency for overestimating periods in short loops&#10;is enhanced. The relationship between loop lengths and periods of the sampled&#10;signals shows the two branches as in the observation. Conclusions. We find that&#10;long periods of decayless oscillations occurring in short loops could be the&#10;result of undersampling.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12095v1) |&#10;| Enwrapped Perylene Bisimide Enables Room Temperature Polariton Lasing&#10; &#160;and Photonic Lattices | Dominik Horneber, Johannes Düreth, Tim Schembri, Simon Betzold, Matthias Stolte, Sven Höfling, Frank Würthner, Sebastian Klembt | &#160;&#160;Perylene bisimides (PBIs) are organic dyes with photoluminescence quantum&#10;yields (PLQY) close to unity in solution and great thermal and photo&#45;chemical&#10;stability. These features alongside the tunability of their solid&#45;state packing&#10;arrangement via chemical functionalization make this material class an&#10;excellent candidate for exciton&#45;polariton lasing at room temperature. Polariton&#10;lasing is well understood in III&#45;V semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures,&#10;however, the search for emitter materials for robust and versatile room&#10;temperature applications is ongoing. While e.g. perovskites and several organic&#10;materials have been identified to support polariton lasing, many of these&#10;materials lack tunability and long&#45;term stability under ambient conditions.&#10;Here, we fabricate optical microcavities using a strongly enwrapped PBI&#10;chromophore with prevailing monomer&#45;like absorption and emission properties in&#10;the solid state. Voluminous bay&#45;substituents prevent stacking induced&#10;PLQY&#45;quenching, thereby enabling polariton lasing at room temperature.&#10;Additionally, photonic confinement in single hemispheric resonators is&#10;demonstrated leading to localized polaritonic modes with discrete energies, as&#10;well as optical lattices revealing distinct polaritonic band&#45;structures. Due to&#10;the possibility of tunable properties by the precise control of the solid&#45;state&#10;packing arrangement of PBI emitters, our results pave the way for&#10;polarization&#45;dependent light&#45;matter coupling, including topological photonic&#10;effects within oriented crystalline thin&#45;film microcavity structures.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12093v1) |&#10;| IMRL: Integrating Visual, Physical, Temporal, and Geometric&#10; &#160;Representations for Enhanced Food Acquisition | Rui Liu, Zahiruddin Mahammad, Amisha Bhaskar, Pratap Tokekar | &#160;&#160;Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality&#10;of life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse&#10;food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents&#10;unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface&#45;level geometric&#10;information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g.,&#10;color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially&#10;when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance.&#10;We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition.&#10;Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy&#10;based on off&#45;the&#45;shelf image encoders such as ResNet&#45;50. However, such&#10;representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse&#10;acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel&#10;approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi&#45;Dimensional Representation Learning), which&#10;integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance&#10;the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach&#10;captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi&#45;solid, granular,&#10;liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and&#10;introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and&#10;assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies&#10;based on context, improving the robot&#39;s capability to handle diverse food&#10;acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach&#39;s&#10;robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations,&#10;including zero&#45;shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves&#10;improvement up to $35%$ in success rate compared with the best&#45;performing&#10;baseline.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12092v1) |&#10;| Uncovering liquid&#45;substrate fluctuation effects on crystal growth and&#10; &#160;disordered hyperuniformity of two&#45;dimensional materials | S. K. Mkhonta, Zhi&#45;Feng Huang, K. R. Elder | &#160;&#160;We investigate the growth of two&#45;dimensional (2D) crystals on fluctuating&#10;surfaces using a phase field crystal model that is relevant on atomic length&#10;and diffusive time scales. Motivated by recent experiments which achieved&#10;unprecedented fast growth of large&#45;size high&#45;quality 2D crystals on liquid&#10;substrates, we uncover novel effects of liquid surfaces on microstructural&#10;ordering. We find that substrate fluctuations generate short&#45;ranged noise that&#10;speeds up crystallization and grain growth of the overlayer, surpassing that of&#10;free&#45;standing system. Coupling to the liquid substrate fluctuations can also&#10;modulate local randomness, leading to intriguing disordered structures with&#10;hidden spatial order, i.e., disordered hyperuniformity. These results reveal&#10;the physical mechanisms underlying the fast growth of 2D crystals on liquid&#10;surfaces and demonstrate a novel strategy for synthesizing disordered&#10;hyperuniform thin film structures.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12090v1) |&#10;| The Impact of Element Ordering on LM Agent Performance | Wayne Chi, Ameet Talwalkar, Chris Donahue | &#160;&#160;There has been a surge of interest in language model agents that can navigate&#10;virtual environments such as the web or desktop. To navigate such environments,&#10;agents benefit from information on the various elements (e.g., buttons, text,&#10;or images) present. It remains unclear which element attributes have the&#10;greatest impact on agent performance, especially in environments that only&#10;provide a graphical representation (i.e., pixels). Here we find that the&#10;ordering in which elements are presented to the language model is surprisingly&#10;impactful&#45;&#45;randomizing element ordering in a webpage degrades agent performance&#10;comparably to removing all visible text from an agent&#39;s state representation.&#10;While a webpage provides a hierarchical ordering of elements, there is no such&#10;ordering when parsing elements directly from pixels. Moreover, as tasks become&#10;more challenging and models more sophisticated, our experiments suggest that&#10;the impact of ordering increases. Finding an effective ordering is non&#45;trivial.&#10;We investigate the impact of various element ordering methods in web and&#10;desktop environments. We find that dimensionality reduction provides a viable&#10;ordering for pixel&#45;only environments. We train a UI element detection model to&#10;derive elements from pixels and apply our findings to an agent&#10;benchmark&#45;&#45;OmniACT&#45;&#45;where we only have access to pixels. Our method completes&#10;more than two times as many tasks on average relative to the previous&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12089v2) |&#10;| Quark saturation in the QCD phase diagram | Marcus Bluhm, Yuki Fujimoto, Larry McLerran, Marlene Nahrgang | &#160;&#160;We determine the onset of Quarkyonic Matter corresponding to values of&#10;temperature and baryon chemical potential at which the quark phase space&#10;density becomes one. At zero temperature for baryon chemical potentials below&#10;the mass of the Lambda baryon, only nucleons contribute to the quark density.&#10;This is different at finite temperature, where all baryons, mesons and their&#10;resonances can be excited and thus add quarks to the phase space. The&#10;probability density to find a quark inside a hadron is determined using the&#10;Yukawa ansatz of the IdylliQ model of Quarkyonic Matter. We estimate separately&#10;the magnitude of the various contributions of nucleons, Delta baryons, pions as&#10;well as further hadrons and resonances. The uncertainty in the parametrization&#10;of the probability density to find a quark inside a nucleon is spanned by&#10;assuming that at zero temperature the transition density to Quarkyonic Matter&#10;is between one and three times that of nuclear matter. Various predictions for&#10;a possible critical point associated with the chiral phase transition are found&#10;close to a triple point at which the line of the deconfinement transition and&#10;the curve associated with the transition to Quarkyonic Matter intersect. These&#10;considerations provide an estimate for the region in the QCD phase diagram&#10;where Quarkyonic Matter may be found.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12088v1) |&#10;| Towards Interpretable End&#45;Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Prediction:&#10; &#160;Utilizing Administrative Claims Data with Explainable AI Techniques | Yubo Li, Saba Al&#45;Sayouri, Rema Padman | &#160;&#160;This study explores the potential of utilizing administrative claims data,&#10;combined with advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, to&#10;predict the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to End&#45;Stage Renal&#10;Disease (ESRD). We analyze a comprehensive, 10&#45;year dataset provided by a major&#10;health insurance organization to develop prediction models for multiple&#10;observation windows using traditional machine learning methods such as Random&#10;Forest and XGBoost as well as deep learning approaches such as Long Short&#45;Term&#10;Memory (LSTM) networks.

We further apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to&#10;enhance interpretability, providing insights into the impact of individual&#10;features on predictions at the individual patient level.

Although cut&#45;based strategies for boosted top&#10;tagging, which rely on substructure information from fat jets resulting from&#10;the hadronic decay of boosted top quarks, were introduced in the literature as&#10;early as 2008, recent years have witnessed a surge in the utilization of&#10;machine learning&#45;based approaches for the classification of top&#45;jets from QCD&#10;jets.

Agyeman, Jinfeng Liu, Sirish L. Shah | &#160;&#160;Efficient water management in agriculture is important for mitigating the&#10;growing freshwater scarcity crisis. Mixed&#45;integer Model Predictive Control&#10;(MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex&#10;scheduling problems in agricultural irrigation. However, the computational&#10;complexity of mixed&#45;integer MPC still poses a significant challenge,&#10;particularly in large&#45;scale applications. This study proposes an approach to&#10;enhance the computational efficiency of mixed&#45;integer MPC&#45;based irrigation&#10;schedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture&#10;dynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed&#45;integer linear&#10;representation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the&#10;mixed&#45;integer MPC&#45;based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a&#10;mixed&#45;integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed&#45;integer&#10;nonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global&#10;optimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated&#10;through comparative studies conducted on a large&#45;scale agricultural field&#10;across two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models,&#10;specifically Long Short&#45;Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used&#10;triggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU&#45;based approach significantly&#10;reduces solution times &#45;&#45; by up to 99.5% &#45;&#45; while achieving comparable&#10;performance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water&#10;Use Efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, the ReLU&#45;based approach maintains enhanced&#10;performance in terms of total prescribed irrigation and IWUE compared to the&#10;widely&#45;used triggered irrigation scheduling method.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12082v1) |&#10;| Design of Ligand&#45;Binding Proteins with Atomic Flow Matching | Junqi Liu, Shaoning Li, Chence Shi, Zhi Yang, Jian Tang | &#160;&#160;Designing novel proteins that bind to small molecules is a long&#45;standing&#10;challenge in computational biology, with applications in developing catalysts,&#10;biosensors, and more. Current computational methods rely on the assumption that&#10;the binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible,&#10;as conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon&#10;binding. In this work, we formulate proteins and molecules as unified&#10;biotokens, and present AtomFlow, a novel deep generative model under the&#10;flow&#45;matching framework for the design of ligand&#45;binding proteins from the 2D&#10;target molecular graph alone. Operating on representative atoms of biotokens,&#10;AtomFlow captures the flexibility of ligands and generates ligand conformations&#10;and protein backbone structures iteratively. We consider the multi&#45;scale nature&#10;of biotokens and demonstrate that AtomFlow can be effectively trained on a&#10;subset of structures from the Protein Data Bank, by matching flow vector field&#10;using an SE(3) equivariant structure prediction network. Experimental results&#10;show that our method can generate high fidelity ligand&#45;binding proteins and&#10;achieve performance comparable to the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art model RFDiffusionAA,&#10;while not requiring bound ligand structures. As a general framework, AtomFlow&#10;holds the potential to be applied to various biomolecule generation tasks in&#10;the future.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12080v1) |&#10;| Denoising diffusion models for high&#45;resolution microscopy image&#10; &#160;restoration | Pamela Osuna&#45;Vargas, Maren H. Wehrheim, Lucas Zinz, Johanna Rahm, Ashwin Balakrishnan, Alexandra Kaminer, Mike Heilemann, Matthias Kaschube | &#160;&#160;Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at&#10;the nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological&#10;organization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of&#10;fluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses&#10;remain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced&#10;laser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and&#10;increased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a&#10;denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high&#45;resolution&#10;images by conditioning the model on low&#45;resolution information. Additionally,&#10;the probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images&#10;that tend to further increase the signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio. We show that our model&#10;achieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously&#10;best&#45;performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly,&#10;while any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but&#10;not all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all&#10;four data sets, suggesting high generalizability.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12078v1) |&#10;| Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Via Data Pruning | Andrea Napoli, Paul White | &#160;&#160;The removal of carefully&#45;selected examples from training data has recently&#10;emerged as an effective way of improving the robustness of machine learning&#10;models. However, the best way to select these examples remains an open&#10;question. In this paper, we consider the problem from the perspective of&#10;unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). We propose AdaPrune, a method for UDA&#10;whereby training examples are removed to attempt to align the training&#10;distribution to that of the target data. By adopting the maximum mean&#10;discrepancy (MMD) as the criterion for alignment, the problem can be neatly&#10;formulated and solved as an integer quadratic program. We evaluate our approach&#10;on a real&#45;world domain shift task of bioacoustic event detection. As a method&#10;for UDA, we show that AdaPrune outperforms related techniques, and is&#10;complementary to other UDA algorithms such as CORAL. Our analysis of the&#10;relationship between the MMD and model accuracy, along with t&#45;SNE plots,&#10;validate the proposed method as a principled and well&#45;founded way of performing&#10;data pruning.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12076v1) |&#10;| The elastica sling | Alessandro Cazzolli, Francesco Dal Corso | &#160;&#160;The nonlinear mechanics of a flexible elastic rod constrained at its edges by&#10;a pair of sliding sleeves is analyzed. The planar equilibrium configurations of&#10;this variable&#45;length elastica are found to have shape defined only by the&#10;inclination of the two constraints, while their distance is responsible only&#10;for scaling the size. By extending the theoretical stability criterion&#10;available for systems under isoperimetric constraints to the case of variable&#10;domains, the existence of no more than one stable equilibrium solution is&#10;revealed. The set of sliding sleeves&#39; inclination pairs for which the stability&#10;is lost are identified. Such critical conditions allow the indefinite ejection&#10;of the flexible rod from the sliding sleeves, thus realizing an elastica sling.&#10;Finally, the theoretical findings are validated by experiments on a physical&#10;prototype. The present results lead to a novel actuation principle that may&#10;find application as a mechanism in energy harvesting, wave mitigation devices,&#10;and soft robotic locomotion.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12075v1) |&#10;| Online Refractive Camera Model Calibration in Visual Inertial Odometry | Mohit Singh, Kostas Alexis | &#160;&#160;This paper presents a general refractive camera model and online&#10;co&#45;estimation of odometry and the refractive index of unknown media. This&#10;enables operation in diverse and varying refractive fluids, given only the&#10;camera calibration in air. The refractive index is estimated online as a state&#10;variable of a monocular visual&#45;inertial odometry framework in an iterative&#10;formulation using the proposed camera model. The method was verified on data&#10;collected using an underwater robot traversing inside a pool. The evaluations&#10;demonstrate convergence to the ideal refractive index for water despite&#10;significant perturbations in the initialization. Simultaneously, the approach&#10;enables on&#45;par visual&#45;inertial odometry performance in refractive media without&#10;prior knowledge of the refractive index or requirement of medium&#45;specific&#10;camera calibration.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12074v1) |&#10;| Influence of dislocations in multilayer graphene stacks: A phase field&#10; &#160;crystal study | K. R. Elder, Zhi&#45;Feng Huang, T. Ala&#45;Nissila | &#160;&#160;In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene&#10;stacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a&#10;recently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems&#10;incorporating out&#45;of&#45;plane deformations and parameterized to match to density&#10;functional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems. The&#10;specific configuration considered consists of one monolayer containing four&#10;$5|7$ dislocations (i.e., two dislocation dipoles) sandwiched in between&#10;perfect graphene layers. The study reveals how the strain field from the&#10;dislocations in the defected layer leads to out&#45;of&#45;plane deformations that in&#10;turn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are&#10;made for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a&#10;defect&#45;free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and&#10;system size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by&#10;roughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence&#10;across the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height&#10;profiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12073v1) |&#10;| PAD&#45;FT: A Lightweight Defense for Backdoor Attacks via Data Purification&#10; &#160;and Fine&#45;Tuning | Yukai Xu, Yujie Gu, Kouichi Sakurai | &#160;&#160;Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks,&#10;particularly as recent advancements have led to increasingly subtle&#10;implantation, making the defense more challenging. Existing defense mechanisms&#10;typically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and&#10;involve retraining an auxiliary model or fine&#45;tuning the entire victim model.&#10;However, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always&#10;feasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and&#10;lightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD&#45;FT, that does not require an&#10;additional clean dataset and fine&#45;tunes only a very small part of the model to&#10;disinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a&#10;simple data purification process to identify and select the most&#45;likely clean&#10;data from the poisoned training dataset. The self&#45;purified clean dataset is&#10;then used for activation clipping and fine&#45;tuning only the last classification&#10;layer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation&#10;clipping, and classifier fine&#45;tuning, our mechanism PAD&#45;FT demonstrates&#10;superior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as&#10;confirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12072v1) |&#10;| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing&#10; &#160;data in Irish sagas | P. MacCarron | &#160;&#160;For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts&#10;in order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify&#10;similarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the&#10;significance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture&#10;requires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and&#10;often impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the&#10;network of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that&#10;the top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent&#10;with central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has&#10;been lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust&#10;to a large random removal of edges.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12071v1) |&#10;| The repetition threshold for ternary rich words | James D. Currie, Lucas Mol, Jarkko Peltomäki | &#160;&#160;In 2014, Vesti proposed the problem of determining the repetition threshold&#10;for infinite rich words, i.e., for infinite words in which all factors of&#10;length $n$ contain $n$ distinct nonempty palindromic factors. In 2020, Currie,&#10;Mol, and Rampersad proved a conjecture of Baranwal and Shallit that the&#10;repetition threshold for binary rich words is $2 + sqrt{2}/2$. In this paper,&#10;we prove a structure theorem for $16/7$&#45;power&#45;free ternary rich words. Using&#10;the structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich&#10;words is $1 + 1/(3 &#45; mu) approx 2.25876324$, where $mu$ is the unique real&#10;root of the polynomial $x^3 &#45; 2x^2 &#45; 1$.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12068v1) |&#10;| Fitting Multilevel Factor Models | Tetiana Parshakova, Trevor Hastie, Stephen Boyd | &#160;&#160;We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance&#10;given by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~cite{parshakova2023factor}. We&#10;develop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation&#45;maximization (EM)&#10;algorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of&#10;the observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and&#10;maintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved&#10;through a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive&#10;definite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of an invertible PSD MLR matrix&#10;is also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the&#10;recursive Sherman&#45;Morrison&#45;Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of&#10;the inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky&#10;factorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities,&#10;yielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement. This paper is&#10;accompanied by an open&#45;source package that implements the proposed methods.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12067v1) |&#10;| Drifts of the sub&#45;stellar points of the TRAPPIST&#45;1 planets | Revol Alexandre, Émeline Bolmont, Mariana Sastre, Gabriel Tobie, Anne&#45;Sophie Libert, Mathilde Kervazo, Sergi Blanco&#45;Cuaresma | &#160;&#160;Accurate modeling of tidal interactions is crucial for interpreting recent&#10;JWST observations of the thermal emissions of TRAPPIST&#45;1~b and c and for&#10;characterizing the surface conditions and potential habitability of the other&#10;planets in the system. Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by&#10;tidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to&#10;their proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the&#10;TRAPPIST&#45;1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In&#10;this work, we present the recent implementation of the co&#45;planar tidal torque&#10;and forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N&#45;body code&#10;Posidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using&#10;a tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of&#10;each planet by taking into account their multi&#45;layer internal structure&#10;computed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST&#45;1 planets&#10;are not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state.&#10;Planet&#45;planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and&#10;tides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a&#10;result, the sub&#45;stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and&#10;long&#45;timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with&#10;periods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12065v1) |&#10;| Quantum Magic and Multi&#45;Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei | Florian Brökemeier, S. Momme Hengstenberg, James W. T. Keeble, Caroline E. P. Robin, Federico Rocco, Martin J. Savage | &#160;&#160;Motivated by the Gottesman&#45;Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the&#10;quantum complexity of $p$&#45;shell and $sd$&#45;shell nuclei. Valence&#45;space nuclear&#10;shell&#45;model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit&#10;registers using the Jordan&#45;Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$&#45;shell and 24&#10;qubits for the $sd$&#45;shell), from which measures of the many&#45;body entanglement&#10;($n$&#45;tangles) and magic (non&#45;stabilizerness) are determined. While exact&#10;evaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of&#10;active nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex&#10;nuclei. The broadly&#45;applicable Pauli&#45;String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe&#45;) MCMC technique&#10;is introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed&#10;nuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $sim 8$ for some&#10;nuclei. Significant multi&#45;nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$&#45;shell,&#10;dominated by proton&#45;neutron configurations, along with significant measures of&#10;magic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on&#10;the path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion.&#10;These results indicate that quantum&#45;computing resources will accelerate&#10;precision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12064v1) |&#10;| Post&#45;Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a&#10; &#160;massive, rotating object | Lorenzo Iorio | &#160;&#160;The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the&#10;general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense&#45;Thirring&#10;components of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are&#10;analytically worked out to the first post&#45;Newtonian level. To the Newtonian&#10;order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as&#10;well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation&#10;in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the&#10;primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first&#10;to &#39;Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system&#10;along an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred&#10;close to the Sun&#39;s flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due&#10;to the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of&#10;microarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for&#10;the post&#45;Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)&#10;spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of&#10;the latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current&#10;(formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would&#10;bring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the&#10;predicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not&#10;changed by any of the post&#45;&#45;Keplerian accelerations considered. The&#10;calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any&#10;alternative models of gravity as well.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12063v1) |&#10;| Generalized Robot Learning Framework | Jiahuan Yan, Zhouyang Hong, Yu Zhao, Yu Tian, Yunxin Liu, Travis Davies, Luhui Hu | &#160;&#160;Imitation based robot learning has recently gained significant attention in&#10;the robotics field due to its theoretical potential for transferability and&#10;generalizability. However, it remains notoriously costly, both in terms of&#10;hardware and data collection, and deploying it in real&#45;world environments&#10;demands meticulous setup of robots and precise experimental conditions. In this&#10;paper, we present a low&#45;cost robot learning framework that is both easily&#10;reproducible and transferable to various robots and environments. We&#10;demonstrate that deployable imitation learning can be successfully applied even&#10;to industrial&#45;grade robots, not just expensive collaborative robotic arms.&#10;Furthermore, our results show that multi&#45;task robot learning is achievable with&#10;simple network architectures and fewer demonstrations than previously thought&#10;necessary. As the current evaluating method is almost subjective when it comes&#10;to real&#45;world manipulation tasks, we propose Voting Positive Rate (VPR) &#45; a&#10;novel evaluation strategy that provides a more objective assessment of&#10;performance. We conduct an extensive comparison of success rates across various&#10;self&#45;designed tasks to validate our approach.

However, the prevailing notion of paraphrase is often quite&#10;simplistic, offering only a limited view of the vast spectrum of paraphrase&#10;phenomena. Indeed, we find that evaluating models in a paraphrase dataset can&#10;leave uncertainty about their true semantic understanding. To alleviate this,&#10;we release paraphrasus, a benchmark designed for multi&#45;dimensional assessment&#10;of paraphrase detection models and finer model selection. We find that&#10;paraphrase detection models under a fine&#45;grained evaluation lens exhibit&#10;trade&#45;offs that cannot be captured through a single classification dataset.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12060v1) |&#10;| Dual&#45;Layer Training and Decoding of Large Language Model with&#10; &#160;Simultaneously Thinking and Speaking | Ningyuan Xi, Xiaoyu Wang, Yetao Wu, Teng Chen, Qingqing Gu, Jinxian Qu, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong Chen, Luo Ji | &#160;&#160;Large Language Model can reasonably understand and generate human expressions&#10;but may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have&#10;been several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but&#10;most of them are not data&#45;driven or training&#45;based. In this paper, we are&#10;motivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel&#10;model architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts&#10;and then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines&#10;to annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt&#45;response samples, then&#10;add language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We&#10;train the language model by the thoughts&#45;augmented data and successfully let&#10;the thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally&#10;output more reasonable responses. Both qualitative examples and quantitative&#10;results validate the effectiveness and performance of TaS.

To address these&#10;concerns, recent research has focused on developing zero&#45;knowledge machine&#10;learning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of&#10;ML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have&#10;substantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily&#10;optimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the&#10;substantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the&#10;model and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new&#10;Commit&#45;and&#45;Prove SNARK (CP&#45;SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that&#10;effectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML&#10;pipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white&#45;box use of the&#10;underlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic&#10;polynomial commitment and only makes black&#45;box use of the proof system. As a&#10;result, Artemis is compatible with state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art proof systems without&#10;trusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP&#45;SNARKs, evaluate&#10;their performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial&#10;improvements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover&#10;costs and maintaining efficiency even for large&#45;scale models. For example, for&#10;the VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from&#10;11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML&#10;towards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and&#10;complex ML models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12055v1) |&#10;| MMP for Enriques pairs and singular Enriques varieties | Francesco Antonio Denisi, Ángel David Ríos Ortiz, Nikolaos Tsakanikas, Zhixin Xie | &#160;&#160;We introduce and study the class of primitive Enriques varieties, whose&#10;smooth members are Enriques manifolds. We provide several examples and we&#10;demonstrate that this class is stable under the operations of the Minimal Model&#10;Program (MMP). In particular, given an Enriques manifold $Y$ and an effective&#10;$mathbb{R}$&#45;divisor $B_Y$ on $Y$ such that the pair $(Y,B_Y)$ is log&#10;canonical, we prove that any $(K_Y+B_Y)$&#45;MMP terminates with a minimal model&#10;$(Y&#39;,B_{Y&#39;})$ of $(Y,B_Y)$, where $Y&#39;$ is a $mathbb{Q}$&#45;factorial primitive&#10;Enriques variety with canonical singularities.

Published codes focus on&#10;continuous rotations and unitary groups, which generally are not applicable to&#10;systems with strong crystal&#45;field effects. The PointGroupNRG code implements&#10;symmetries related to discrete rotation groups, which are defined by the user&#10;in terms of Clebsch&#45;Gordan coefficients, together with particle conservation&#10;and spin rotation symmetries. In this paper we present a new version of the&#10;code that extends the available finite groups, previously limited to simply&#10;reducible point groups, in a way that all point and double groups become&#10;accessible. It also includes the full spin&#45;orbital rotation group. Moreover, to&#10;improve the code&#39;s flexibility for impurities with complex interactions, this&#10;new version allows to choose between a standard Anderson Hamiltonian for the&#10;impurity or, as another novel feature, an ionic model that requires only the&#10;spectrum and the impurity Lehmann amplitudes.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12050v1) |&#10;| Quantum&#45;like nonlinear interferometry with frequency&#45;engineered&#10; &#160;classical light | Romain Dalidet, Anthony Martin, Grégory Sauder, Laurent Labonté, Sébastien Tanzilli | &#160;&#160;Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic&#10;entanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits. Nonlinear&#10;optics has served as a workhorse for the generation of entangled photon pairs,&#10;ensuring both energy and phase conservation, but at the cost of limited rate&#10;and degraded signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio compared to laser&#45;based interferometry&#10;approaches. We present a &quot;quantum&#45;like&quot; nonlinear optical method that reaches&#10;super&#45;resolution in single&#45;photon detection regime. This is achieved by&#10;replacing photon&#45;pairs by coherent states of light, mimicking quantum&#10;properties through classical nonlinear optics processes. Our scheme utilizes&#10;two high&#45;brightness lasers. This results in a substantially greater&#10;signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio compared to its quantum counterpart. Such an approach&#10;paves the way to significantly reduced acquisition times, providing a pathway&#10;to explore signals across a broader range of bandwidth. The need to increase&#10;the frequency bandwidth of the quantum sensor significantly motivates the&#10;potential applications of this pathway.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12049v1) |&#10;| A Survey&#45;Based Quantitative Analysis of Stress Factors and Their Impacts&#10; &#160;Among Cybersecurity Professionals | Sunil Arora, John D. Hastings | &#160;&#160;This study investigates the prevalence and underlying causes of work&#45;related&#10;stress and burnout among cybersecurity professionals using a quantitative&#10;survey approach guided by the Job Demands&#45;Resources model. Analysis of&#10;responses from 50 cybersecurity practitioners reveals an alarming reality: 44%&#10;report experiencing severe work&#45;related stress and burnout, while an additional&#10;28% are uncertain about their condition. The demanding nature of cybersecurity&#10;roles, unrealistic expectations, and unsupportive organizational cultures&#10;emerge as primary factors fueling this crisis. Notably, 66% of respondents&#10;perceive cybersecurity jobs as more stressful than other IT positions, with 84%&#10;facing additional challenges due to the pandemic and recent high&#45;profile&#10;breaches. The study finds that most cybersecurity experts are reluctant to&#10;report their struggles to management, perpetuating a cycle of silence and&#10;neglect. To address this critical issue, the paper recommends that&#10;organizations foster supportive work environments, implement mindfulness&#10;programs, and address systemic challenges. By prioritizing the mental health of&#10;cybersecurity professionals, organizations can cultivate a more resilient and&#10;effective workforce to protect against an ever&#45;evolving threat landscape.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12047v1) |&#10;| Using Large Language Models to Generate Clinical Trial Tables and&#10; &#160;Figures | Yumeng Yang, Peter Krusche, Kristyn Pantoja, Cheng Shi, Ethan Ludmir, Kirk Roberts, Gen Zhu | &#160;&#160;Tables, figures, and listings (TFLs) are essential tools for summarizing&#10;clinical trial data.

While most approaches in the Safe&#10;Reinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and&#10;robot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them&#10;in complex real&#45;world settings. Instead, model&#45;based approaches that&#10;incorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning&#10;framework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on&#10;the real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot&#10;dynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task&#45;specific and hard&#10;to obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to&#10;compute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long&#45;term safety&#10;requirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe&#10;exploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus&#10;on ensuring long&#45;term safety and handling of uncertainty. Our approach is&#10;competitive or superior to state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methods in final performance while&#10;maintaining safer behavior during training.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12045v1) |&#10;| Quasiperiodic Floquet&#45;Gibbs states in Rydberg atomic systems | Wilson S. Martins, Federico Carollo, Kay Brandner, Igor Lesanovsky | &#160;&#160;Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by&#10;fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an&#10;equilibrium&#45;like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet&#45;Magnus&#10;Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi&#39;s golden rule, we show&#10;that such Floquet&#45;Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated&#10;Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab&#45;frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function&#10;of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the&#10;system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which&#10;is necessary to uphold high&#45;lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To&#10;corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five&#10;interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate&#10;numerically that the second&#45;order Floquet&#45;Gibbs state of this system is&#10;essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding&#10;Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently&#10;large.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12044v1) |&#10;| Understanding the Effects of the Baidu&#45;ULTR Logging Policy on Two&#45;Tower&#10; &#160;Models | Morris de Haan, Philipp Hager | &#160;&#160;Despite the popularity of the two&#45;tower model for unbiased learning to rank&#10;(ULTR) tasks, recent work suggests that it suffers from a major limitation that&#10;could lead to its collapse in industry applications: the problem of logging&#10;policy confounding.

Our main contributions are threefold: 1) we&#10;show that the conditions for the confounding problem are given on Baidu&#45;ULTR,&#10;2) the confounding problem bears no significant effect on the two&#45;tower model,&#10;and 3) we point to a potential mismatch between expert annotations, the golden&#10;standard in ULTR, and user click behavior.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12043v1) |&#10;| ASR Benchmarking: Need for a More Representative Conversational Dataset | Gaurav Maheshwari, Dmitry Ivanov, Théo Johannet, Kevin El Haddad | &#160;&#160;Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable&#10;performance on widely used benchmarks such as LibriSpeech and Fleurs. However,&#10;these benchmarks do not adequately reflect the complexities of real&#45;world&#10;conversational environments, where speech is often unstructured and contains&#10;disfluencies such as pauses, interruptions, and diverse accents. In this study,&#10;we introduce a multilingual conversational dataset, derived from TalkBank,&#10;consisting of unstructured phone conversation between adults. Our results show&#10;a significant performance drop across various state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art ASR models when&#10;tested in conversational settings. Furthermore, we observe a correlation&#10;between Word Error Rate and the presence of speech disfluencies, highlighting&#10;the critical need for more realistic, conversational ASR benchmarks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12042v1) |&#10;&#10;">

KhudaBukhsh | &#160;&#160;This paper makes three key contributions. First, via a substantial corpus of&#10;51,278 interview questions sourced from 888 YouTube videos of mock interviews&#10;of Indian civil service candidates, we demonstrate stark gender bias in the&#10;broad nature of questions asked to male and female candidates. Second, our&#10;experiments with large language models show a strong presence of gender bias in&#10;explanations provided by the LLMs on the gender inference task. Finally, we&#10;present a novel dataset of 51,278 interview questions that can inform future&#10;social science studies.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12194v3) |&#10;| DynaMo: In&#45;Domain Dynamics Pretraining for Visuo&#45;Motor Control | Zichen Jeff Cui, Hengkai Pan, Aadhithya Iyer, Siddhant Haldar, Lerrel Pinto | &#160;&#160;Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex&#10;visuomotor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to&#10;thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high&#45;dimensional visual&#10;observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual&#10;representations are predominantly either pretrained on out&#45;of&#45;domain data or&#10;trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present&#10;DynaMo, a new in&#45;domain, self&#45;supervised method for learning visual&#10;representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a&#10;latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of&#10;image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without&#10;augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.&#10;Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out&#45;of&#45;domain data such as Internet&#10;datasets or cross&#45;embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real&#10;environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly&#10;improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self&#45;supervised&#10;learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo&#10;hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,&#10;and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and&#10;measure its impact on downstream policy performance.

Qwen2&#45;VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,&#10;which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions&#10;into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to&#10;generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning&#10;with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary&#10;Position Embedding (M&#45;RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional&#10;information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for&#10;processing both images and videos, enhancing the model&#39;s visual perception&#10;capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2&#45;VL&#10;investigates the scaling laws for large vision&#45;language models (LVLMs). By&#10;scaling both the model size&#45;with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters&#45;and the&#10;amount of training data, the Qwen2&#45;VL Series achieves highly competitive&#10;performance. Notably, the Qwen2&#45;VL&#45;72B model achieves results comparable to&#10;leading models such as GPT&#45;4o and Claude3.5&#45;Sonnet across various multimodal&#10;benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models.

BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses&#10;and 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance&#10;of deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to&#10;integrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and&#10;performance. However, widely&#45;used C++&#45;based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,&#10;g$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries&#10;like PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of&#10;debugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we&#10;introduce an eager&#45;mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,&#10;providing PyTorch&#45;compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach&#10;includes GPU&#45;accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for&#10;2nd&#45;order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear&#10;solvers. Our eager&#45;mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency,&#10;achieving an average speedup of 18.5$times$, 22$times$, and 23$times$&#10;compared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12190v1) |&#10;| Massively Multi&#45;Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context | Felix B Mueller, Julian Tanke, Juergen Gall | &#160;&#160;Forecasting long&#45;term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of&#10;human behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input&#10;sequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby&#10;people can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene&#45;aware social&#10;transformer model (SAST) to forecast long&#45;term (10s) human motion motion.&#10;Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely&#10;varying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal&#10;convolutional encoder&#45;decoder architecture with a Transformer&#45;based bottleneck&#10;that allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model&#10;the conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We&#10;benchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to&#10;16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously.

Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon | &#160;&#160;Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a&#10;perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from&#10;fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($mu$&#45;distortion) to late&#45;time&#10;baryonic feedback processes (y&#45;distortion). While the y&#45;distortion can be&#10;detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the&#10;$Lambda$CDM&#45;predicted $mu$&#45;distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude&#10;smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a&#10;serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $mu$&#10;arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the&#10;primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k approx 1&#45;10^{4}$ Mpc$^{&#45;1}$. Here,&#10;we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly&#10;detecting $mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but&#10;with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we&#10;optimize the instrument&#39;s configuration to target $mu$ while robustly&#10;marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike&#10;Fourier&#45;transform&#45;spectrometer&#45;based designs, the specific bands and their&#10;individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing&#10;significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the&#10;$Lambda$CDM&#45;predicted $mu$&#45;distortion at $approx 5sigma$ (10$sigma$)&#10;assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission&#10;duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized&#10;configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1&#45;2000 GHz with degree&#45;scale angular&#10;resolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally&#10;measure the y&#45;distortion at sub&#45;percent precision and its relativistic&#10;correction at percent&#45;level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total&#10;thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12188v1) |&#10;| Exoplanet accretion monitoring spectroscopic survey (ENTROPY) I.&#10; &#160;Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary&#45;mass&#10; &#160;object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C.

Detection of emission lines from&#10;accreting gas giants facilitate detailed investigations into this process. This&#10;work presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known&#10;young, planetary&#45;mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf&#10;2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7&#45;21 Mj and age 5&#45;45 Myr, located at 45+&#45;2&#10;pc. We obtained the first high&#45;resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target&#10;with VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near&#45;UV to visible wavelengths (3200&#45;6800&#10;AA). We report resolved H3&#45;H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.&#10;Based on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+&#45;1&#10;km/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR&#10;excess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of&#10;the parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+&#45;63 K and radius to 1.5+&#45;0.1&#10;Rj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet&#45;surface shock model&#10;implies a pre&#45;shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,&#45;40) km/s and a pre&#45;shock&#10;density of log(n0/cm^&#45;3)=14(+0,&#45;5). Pre&#45;shock velocity points to a mass of&#10;6(+8,&#45;4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary&#10;Lline&#45;Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of&#10;1.4(+2.8,&#45;0.9)x10^&#45;8 Mj/yr.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12187v1) |&#10;| Qwen2.5&#45;Coder Technical Report | Binyuan Hui, Jian Yang, Zeyu Cui, Jiaxi Yang, Dayiheng Liu, Lei Zhang, Tianyu Liu, Jiajun Zhang, Bowen Yu, Kai Dang, An Yang, Rui Men, Fei Huang, Xingzhang Ren, Xuancheng Ren, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin | &#160;&#160;In this report, we introduce the Qwen2.5&#45;Coder series, a significant upgrade&#10;from its predecessor, CodeQwen1.5. This series includes two models:&#10;Qwen2.5&#45;Coder&#45;1.5B and Qwen2.5&#45;Coder&#45;7B. As a code&#45;specific model,&#10;Qwen2.5&#45;Coder is built upon the Qwen2.5 architecture and continues pretrained&#10;on a vast corpus of over 5.5 trillion tokens. Through meticulous data cleaning,&#10;scalable synthetic data generation, and balanced data mixing, Qwen2.5&#45;Coder&#10;demonstrates impressive code generation capabilities while retaining general&#10;versatility. The model has been evaluated on a wide range of code&#45;related&#10;tasks, achieving state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art (SOTA) performance across more than 10&#10;benchmarks, including code generation, completion, reasoning, and repair,&#10;consistently outperforming larger models of the same model size. We believe&#10;that the release of the Qwen2.5&#45;Coder series will not only push the boundaries&#10;of research in code intelligence but also, through its permissive licensing,&#10;encourage broader adoption by developers in real&#45;world applications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12186v1) |&#10;| Disruption of a massive molecular cloud by a supernova in the Galactic&#10; &#160;Centre: Initial results from the ACES project | M.

Xu | &#160;&#160;The Milky Way&#39;s Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our&#10;local solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions&#10;it exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong&#10;dynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).&#10;Consequently, it is likely that there are large&#45;scale physical structures&#10;within the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we&#10;present new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array&#10;(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a&#10;multi&#45;wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the&#10;M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring&#45;like morphology. We&#10;estimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring to be 79&quot;&#10;and 154&quot;, respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre&#10;distance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $&gt; 10^{4}$ cm$^{&#45;3}$, a&#10;mass of $sim$ $10^6$ M$_odot$, and an expansion speed of $sim$ 20 km&#10;s$^{&#45;1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($&gt; 10^{51}$ erg) and&#10;momentum ($&gt; 10^7$ M$_odot$ km s$^{&#45;1}$). We discuss several possible causes&#10;for the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback&#10;and large&#45;scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the&#10;M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring is a single high&#45;energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain&#10;the observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have&#10;taken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which&#10;we now see as the M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an&#10;extreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12185v1) |&#10;| To CoT or not to CoT?

But for what kinds of&#10;tasks is this extra ``thinking&#39;&#39; really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted&#10;a quantitative meta&#45;analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own&#10;evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives&#10;strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with&#10;much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the&#10;answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the&#10;question or model&#39;s response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic&#10;operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of&#10;CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing&#10;against tool&#45;augmented LLMs. Much of CoT&#39;s gain comes from improving symbolic&#10;execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our&#10;results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance&#10;while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond&#10;prompt&#45;based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation&#10;across the whole range of LLM applications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183v1) |&#10;| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs | Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T. Chiu, Siyu Ren, Fei Yuan, Wenting Zhao, Zhiyong Wu, Alexander M. Rush | &#160;&#160;Broad textual understanding and in&#45;context learning require language models&#10;that utilize full document contexts. Due to the implementation challenges&#10;associated with directly training long&#45;context models, many methods have been&#10;proposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to&#10;differences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these&#10;approaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long&#45;context&#10;performance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a&#10;controlled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation,&#10;utilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several&#10;insights into long&#45;context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of&#10;perplexity as a general&#45;purpose performance indicator even in longer&#45;context&#10;tasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods&#10;systematically underperform across long&#45;context tasks. Finally, we confirm that&#10;exact fine&#45;tuning based methods are generally effective within the range of&#10;their extension, whereas extrapolation remains challenging.

Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate&#10;information that conflicts with real&#45;world facts, and their persuasive style&#10;can make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result,&#10;end&#45;users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with&#10;the accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all&#10;outputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore&#10;supervised finetuning on uncertainty&#45;augmented predictions as a method to&#10;develop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty.&#10;Specifically, we measure the calibration of pre&#45;trained models and then&#10;fine&#45;tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of&#10;uncertainty. Through experiments on various question&#45;answering datasets, we&#10;demonstrate that LLMs are well&#45;calibrated in assessing their predictions, and&#10;supervised finetuning based on the model&#39;s own confidence leads to&#10;well&#45;calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single&#45;claim&#10;answers.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12180v1) |&#10;| Computational Dynamical Systems | Jordan Cotler, Semon Rezchikov | &#160;&#160;We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite&#45;dimensional&#10;dynamical systems. Building off of previous work, we give definitions for what&#10;it means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine. We then&#10;show that &#39;chaotic&#39; dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and&#10;&#39;integrable&#39; dynamical systems (more generally, measure&#45;preserving systems)&#10;cannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines can&#10;be robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, we&#10;show that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable&#10;one&#45;dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and&#10;moreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt.&#10;More broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one &#39;machine&#39; to simulate&#10;another, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low&#45;complexity &#39;encoders&#39; and&#10;&#39;decoders&#39; to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system&#10;being simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical&#10;system leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity&#10;theory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12179v1) |&#10;| Poisson approximate likelihood compared to the particle filter | Yize Hao, Aaron A. Abkemeier, Edward L. Ionides | &#160;&#160;Filtering algorithms are fundamental for inference on partially observed&#10;stochastic dynamic systems, since they provide access to the likelihood&#10;function and hence enable likelihood&#45;based or Bayesian inference. A novel&#10;Poisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.&#10;(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering&#10;a fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of&#10;partially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL&#10;is the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large&#10;improvement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,&#10;based on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.&#10;(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should&#10;use PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence&#10;also reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a&#10;shortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that&#10;the comparison of log&#45;likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al. (2023) is&#10;flawed because their PAL calculations were carried out using a dataset scaled&#10;differently from the previous study. If PAL and the particle filter are applied&#10;to the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears. On simulations&#10;where the model is correctly specified, the particle filter outperforms PAL.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12173v1) |&#10;| You Only Read Once (YORO): Learning to Internalize Database Knowledge&#10; &#160;for Text&#45;to&#45;SQL | Hideo Kobayashi, Wuwei Lan, Peng Shi, Shuaichen Chang, Jiang Guo, Henghui Zhu, Zhiguo Wang, Patrick Ng | &#160;&#160;While significant progress has been made on the text&#45;to&#45;SQL task, recent&#10;solutions repeatedly encode the same database schema for every question,&#10;resulting in unnecessary high inference cost and often overlooking crucial&#10;database knowledge. To address these issues, we propose You Only Read Once&#10;(YORO), a novel paradigm that directly internalizes database knowledge into the&#10;parametric knowledge of a text&#45;to&#45;SQL model during training and eliminates the&#10;need for schema encoding during inference. YORO significantly reduces the input&#10;token length by 66%&#45;98%. Despite its shorter inputs, our empirical results&#10;demonstrate YORO&#39;s competitive performances with traditional systems on three&#10;benchmarks as well as its significant outperformance on large databases.&#10;Furthermore, YORO excels in handling questions with challenging value&#10;retrievals such as abbreviation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12172v1) |&#10;| Ergodic properties of infinite extension of symmetric interval exchange&#10; &#160;transformations | Przemysław Berk, Frank Trujillo, Hao Wu | &#160;&#160;We prove that skew products with the cocycle given by the function&#10;$f(x)=a(x&#45;1/2)$ with $a&#10;eq 0$ are ergodic for every ergodic symmetric IET in&#10;the base, thus giving the full characterization of ergodic extensions in this&#10;family. Moreover, we prove that under an additional natural assumption of&#10;unique ergodicity on the IET, we can replace $f$ with any differentiable&#10;function with a non&#45;zero sum of jumps. Finally, by considering weakly mixing&#10;IETs instead of just ergodic, we show that the skew products with cocycle given&#10;by $f$ have infinite ergodic index.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12168v1) |&#10;| multiPI&#45;TransBTS: A Multi&#45;Path Learning Framework for Brain Tumor Image&#10; &#160;Segmentation Based on Multi&#45;Physical Information | Hongjun Zhu, Jiaohang Huang, Kuo Chen, Xuehui Ying, Ying Qian | &#160;&#160;Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis,&#10;treatment planning, and monitoring the progression of brain tumors. However,&#10;due to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across&#10;different MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In&#10;this study, we propose a novel Transformer&#45;based framework, multiPI&#45;TransBTS,&#10;which integrates multi&#45;physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.&#10;The model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi&#45;modal&#10;imaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor&#10;characteristics. The multiPI&#45;TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an&#10;Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi&#45;source, multi&#45;scale feature&#10;decoder. The encoder incorporates a multi&#45;branch architecture to separately&#10;extract modality&#45;specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module&#10;fuses information from multiple sources using channel&#45;wise and element&#45;wise&#10;attention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both&#10;common and task&#45;specific features through a Task&#45;Specific Feature Introduction&#10;(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),&#10;Tumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on&#10;the BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of&#10;multiPI&#45;TransBTS over the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methods. The model consistently&#10;achieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,&#10;highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results&#10;also indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision&#10;and recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a&#10;significant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving&#10;clinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12167v1) |&#10;| Synchrotron self&#45;Compton in a radiative&#45;adiabatic fireball scenario:&#10; &#160;Modelling the multiwavelength observations in some Fermi/LAT bursts | Nissim Fraija, P. Veres, B. Betancourt Kamenetskaia, A. Galvan&#45;Gamez, M. G. Dainotti, Simone Dichiara, R. L. Becerra | &#160;&#160;Energetic GeV photons expected from the closest and the most energetic&#10;Gamma&#45;ray bursts (GRBs) provide an unique opportunity to study the&#10;very&#45;high&#45;energy emission as well as the possible correlations with lower&#10;energy bands in realistic GRB afterglow models. In the standard GRB afterglow&#10;model, the relativistic homogeneous shock is usually considered to be fully&#10;adiabatic, however, it could be partially radiative. Based on the external&#10;forward&#45;shock scenario in both stellar wind and constant&#45;density medium. We&#10;present a radiative&#45;adiabatic analytical model of the synchrotron self&#45;Compton&#10;(SSC) and synchrotron processes considering an electron energy distribution&#10;with a power&#45;law index of 1 &lt; p &lt; 2 and 2 $&#10;eq$ p. We show that the SSC&#10;scenario plays a relevant role in the radiative parameter $epsilon$, leading&#10;to a prolonged evolution during the slow cooling regime. In a particular case,&#10;we derive the Fermi/LAT light curves together with the photons with energies&#10;$geq$ 100 MeV in a sample of nine bursts from the second Fermi/LAT GRB catalog&#10;that exhibited temporal and spectral indices with $geq$ 1.5 and $approx$ 2,&#10;respectively. These events can hardly be described with closure relations of&#10;the standard synchrotron afterglow model, and also exhibit energetic photons&#10;above the synchrotron limit. We have modeled the multi&#45;wavelength observations&#10;of our sample to constrain the microphysical parameters, the circumburst&#10;density, the bulk Lorentz factor and the mechanism responsible for explaining&#10;the energetic GeV photons.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12166v1) |&#10;| Blind Deconvolution on Graphs: Exact and Stable Recovery | Chang Ye, Gonzalo Mateos | &#160;&#160;We study a blind deconvolution problem on graphs, which arises in the context&#10;of localizing a few sources that diffuse over networks. While the observations&#10;are bilinear functions of the unknown graph filter coefficients and sparse&#10;input signals, a mild requirement on invertibility of the diffusion filter&#10;enables an efficient convex relaxation leading to a linear programming&#10;formulation that can be tackled with off&#45;the&#45;shelf solvers. Under the&#10;Bernoulli&#45;Gaussian model for the inputs, we derive sufficient exact recovery&#10;conditions in the noise&#45;free setting. A stable recovery result is then&#10;established, ensuring the estimation error remains manageable even when the&#10;observations are corrupted by a small amount of noise. Numerical tests with&#10;synthetic and real&#45;world network data illustrate the merits of the proposed&#10;algorithm, its robustness to noise as well as the benefits of leveraging&#10;multiple signals to aid the (blind) localization of sources of diffusion. At a&#10;fundamental level, the results presented here broaden the scope of classical&#10;blind deconvolution of (spatio&#45;)temporal signals to irregular graph domains.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12164v1) |&#10;| Generalized compression and compressive search of large datasets | Morgan E. Prior, Thomas Howard III, Emily Light, Najib Ishaq, Noah M. Daniels | &#160;&#160;The Big Data explosion has necessitated the development of search algorithms&#10;that scale sub&#45;linearly in time and memory.&#10; &#160;While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently,&#10;few algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain&#45;specific.&#10; &#160;We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to&#10;perform $k$&#45;NN and $&#13;ho$&#45;NN search on compressed data while only decompressing&#10;a small, relevant, portion of the data.&#10; &#160;panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low&#45;dimensional&#10;structure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.&#10; &#160;panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between&#10;two points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in&#10;terms of the other.&#10; &#160;This property holds for many widely&#45;used distance functions, e.g. string edit&#10;distances (Levenshtein, Needleman&#45;Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures&#10;(Jaccard, Dice, etc.).&#10; &#160;We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic,&#10;and set data.&#10; &#160;We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the&#10;compressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.&#10; &#160;panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering&#10;sub&#45;linear time performance for $k$&#45;NN and $&#13;ho$&#45;NN search.&#10; &#160;We conclude that panCAKES is an efficient, general&#45;purpose algorithm for&#10;exact compressive search on large datasets that obey the manifold hypothesis.&#10; &#160;We provide an open&#45;source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming&#10;language.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12161v1) |&#10;| WeHelp: A Shared Autonomy System for Wheelchair Users | Abulikemu Abuduweili, Alice Wu, Tianhao Wei, Weiye Zhao | &#160;&#160;There is a large population of wheelchair users. Most of the wheelchair users&#10;need help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs&#10;are not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this&#10;project, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair&#10;users. A robot with a WeHelp system has three modes, following mode, remote&#10;control mode and tele&#45;operation mode. In the following mode, the robot follows&#10;the wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can&#10;ask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the&#10;wheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech&#10;recognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode.&#10;In the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy&#10;stick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs,&#10;such as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high&#10;shelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant&#10;takes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks&#10;for their needs. Our evaluation shows that the pipeline is useful and practical&#10;for wheelchair users.

These IFSs&#10;exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are&#10;topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the&#10;Blonder&#45;Tinkham&#45;Klapwijk formalism and considering normal&#45;$d$&#45;wave&#10;superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients&#10;including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and&#10;examine the validation of Widemann&#45;Franz law in the presence of both voltage&#10;and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of&#10;$d$&#45;wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the&#10;normal&#45;superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric&#10;response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in&#10;Seebeck coefficient ($sim 200,mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($sim 3.5$) due to the&#10;generation of the IFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for&#10;device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by&#10;computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice&#45;regularized&#10;version of our continuum model.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12157v1) |&#10;| JEAN: Joint Expression and Audio&#45;guided NeRF&#45;based Talking Face&#10; &#160;Generation | Sai Tanmay Reddy Chakkera, Aggelina Chatziagapi, Dimitris Samaras | &#160;&#160;We introduce a novel method for joint expression and audio&#45;guided talking&#10;face generation. Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker&#10;identity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these&#10;challenges, we propose a NeRF&#45;based network. Since we train our network on&#10;monocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn&#10;disentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio&#10;features in a self&#45;supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects.&#10;By incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned&#10;audio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle&#10;motion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer&#45;based architecture&#10;that learns expression features, capturing long&#45;range facial expressions and&#10;disentangling them from the speech&#45;specific mouth movements. Through&#10;quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can&#10;synthesize high&#45;fidelity talking face videos, achieving state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art facial&#10;expression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12156v1) |&#10;| Autopet III challenge: Incorporating anatomical knowledge into nnUNet&#10; &#160;for lesion segmentation in PET/CT | Hamza Kalisch, Fabian Hörst, Ken Herrmann, Jens Kleesiek, Constantin Seibold | &#160;&#160;Lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging is essential for precise tumor&#10;characterization, which supports personalized treatment planning and enhances&#10;diagnostic precision in oncology. However, accurate manual segmentation of&#10;lesions is time&#45;consuming and prone to inter&#45;observer variability. Given the&#10;rising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods,&#10;particularly deep&#45;learning&#45;based approaches, have become increasingly more&#10;relevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation&#10;of tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting,&#10;addressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable&#10;solutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET&#10;challenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers&#10;(FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers. To this extent, we developed a&#10;classifier that identifies the tracer of the given PET/CT based on the Maximum&#10;Intensity Projection of the PET scan. We trained two individual&#10;nnUNet&#45;ensembles for each tracer where anatomical labels are included as a&#10;multi&#45;label task to enhance the model&#39;s performance. Our final submission&#10;achieves cross&#45;validation Dice scores of 76.90% and 61.33% for the publicly&#10;available FDG and PSMA datasets, respectively.

However, a&#10;robot&#39;s ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if&#10;naively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach&#45;avoid&#10;dynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a&#10;safety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human&#39;s behavior&#10;as goal&#45;driven but conditioned on the robot&#39;s plan, enabling us to capture&#10;influence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical&#10;and belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in&#10;human behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE&#10;(Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high&#45;dimensional&#10;(39&#45;D) simulated human&#45;robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline&#10;game&#45;theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust&#10;baseline that treats the human as a worst&#45;case adversary, a safety controller&#10;that does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy&#45;function&#45;based&#10;safety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage&#10;the influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing&#10;the robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate&#10;during task execution.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12153v1) |&#10;| Decoding Style: Efficient Fine&#45;Tuning of LLMs for Image&#45;Guided Outfit&#10; &#160;Recommendation with Preference | Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan | &#160;&#160;Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding&#10;both fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper&#10;presents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large&#10;language models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their &quot;black box&quot; and static&#10;nature through fine&#45;tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item&#10;visual&#45;textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a&#10;Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style&#10;and color characteristics from human&#45;curated fashion images, forming the basis&#10;for personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine&#45;tuned on the&#10;open&#45;source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability&#10;to recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative&#10;examples is employed to enhance the LLM&#39;s decision&#45;making process. This creates&#10;a self&#45;enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in&#10;line with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore&#10;dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill&#45;in&#45;the&#45;blank,&#10;and complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework&#39;s&#10;ability to generate stylish, trend&#45;aligned outfit suggestions, continuously&#10;improving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our&#10;proposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more&#10;cohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the&#10;proposed framework&#39;s potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate&#10;suggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit&#10;generation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12150v1) |&#10;| Mechanical Wannier&#45;Stark Ladder of Diamond Spin&#45;Mechanical Lamb Wave&#10; &#160;Resonators | Philip Andrango, Hailin Wang | &#160;&#160;We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier&#45;Stark ladders of&#10;diamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with&#10;ultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin&#10;properties. Three nearest&#45;neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric&#10;configurations and a large range of coupling rates have been explored for the&#10;realization of Wannier&#45;Stark ladders of LWRs, potentially enabling long&#45;range&#10;connectivity between spin qubits through their interactions with mechanical&#10;vibrations. Additional analysis on the effects of disorder indicates that the&#10;proposed Wannier&#45;Stark ladder can be robust against realistic experimental&#10;imperfections. The development of mechanical quantum networks of spin qubits&#10;with long&#45;range connectivity can open the door to the implementation of newly&#10;developed quantum low&#45;density parity&#45;check codes in solid&#45;state systems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12149v1) |&#10;| MAgICoRe: Multi&#45;Agent, Iterative, Coarse&#45;to&#45;Fine Refinement for&#10; &#160;Reasoning | Justin Chih&#45;Yao Chen, Archiki Prasad, Swarnadeep Saha, Elias Stengel&#45;Eskin, Mohit Bansal | &#160;&#160;Large Language Models&#39; (LLM) reasoning can be improved using test&#45;time&#10;aggregation strategies, i.e., generating multiple samples and voting among&#10;generated samples. While these improve performance, they often reach a&#10;saturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM&#45;generated&#10;feedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key&#10;challenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can&#10;over&#45;correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and&#10;address errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self&#45;correct and struggle to&#10;identify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding&#10;how many iterations of refinement are needed is non&#45;trivial, and stopping too&#10;soon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose&#10;MAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty&#10;as easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse&#45;grained aggregation and hard&#10;ones with fine&#45;grained and iterative multi&#45;agent refinement. To improve error&#10;localization, we incorporate external step&#45;wise reward model (RM) scores.&#10;Moreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi&#45;agent loop with&#10;three agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on&#10;step&#45;wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure&#10;sufficient refinement, we re&#45;evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating&#10;further rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama&#45;3&#45;8B and GPT&#45;3.5&#10;and show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of&#10;MAgICoRe beats Self&#45;Consistency by 3.4%, Best&#45;of&#45;k by 3.2%, and Self&#45;Refine by&#10;4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with&#10;baselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our&#10;ablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe&#39;s RMs and multi&#45;agent&#10;communication.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147v1) |&#10;| Lempel&#45;Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka | &#160;&#160;Lempel&#45;Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string&#10;processing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into&#10;blocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence&#10;of a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another&#10;occurrence earlier in $T$. Due to numerous applications, LZ77 factorization is&#10;one of the most studied problems on strings. In the 47 years since its&#10;inception, several algorithms were developed for different models of&#10;computation, including parallel, GPU, external&#45;memory, and quantum. Remarkably,&#10;however, the complexity of the most basic variant is still not settled: All&#10;existing algorithms in the RAM model run in $Omega(n)$ time, which is a&#10;$Theta(&#10;og n)$ factor away from the lower bound of $Omega(n/&#10;og n)$&#10;(following from the necessity to read the input, which takes $Theta(n/&#10;og n)$&#10;space for $Tin{0,1}^{n}$).&#10; &#160;We present the first $o(n)$&#45;time algorithm for LZ77 factorization, breaking&#10;the linear&#45;time barrier present for nearly 50 years. For $Tin{0,1}^{n}$, our&#10;algorithm runs in $mathcal{O}(n/sqrt{&#10;og n})=o(n)$ time and uses the optimal&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og n)$ working space. Our algorithm generalizes to&#10;$Sigma=[0..sigma)$, where $sigma=n^{mathcal{O}(1)}$. The runtime and&#10;working space then become $mathcal{O}((n&#10;ogsigma)/sqrt{&#10;og n})$ and&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og_{sigma} n)$. To obtain our algorithm, we prove a more&#10;general result: For any constant $epsilonin(0,1)$ and $Tin[0..sigma)^{n}$,&#10;in $mathcal{O}((n&#10;ogsigma)/sqrt{&#10;og n})$ time and using&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og_{sigma}n)$ space, we can construct an&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og_{sigma}n)$&#45;size index that, given any $P=T[j..j+ell)$&#10;(represented as $(j,ell)$), computes the leftmost occurrence of $P$ in $T$ in&#10;$mathcal{O}(&#10;og^{epsilon}n)$ time. In other words, we solve the&#10;indexing/online variant of the LZ77 problem.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12146v1) |&#10;| Experimental Evidence That Conversational Artificial Intelligence Can&#10; &#160;Steer Consumer Behavior Without Detection | Tobias Werner, Ivan Soraperra, Emilio Calvano, David C.

The long&#45;standing goal of&#10;creating a predictive global model for the binding energy of a nucleus remains&#10;a significant challenge, however, and prompts the need for precise measurements&#10;of atomic masses to serve as anchor points for model developments. We present&#10;precise mass measurements of neutron&#45;rich Ru and Pd isotopes performed at the&#10;Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade facility at Argonne National&#10;Laboratory using the Canadian Penning Trap mass spectrometer. The masses of&#10;$^{108}$Ru, $^{110}$Ru and $^{116}$Pd were measured to a relative mass&#10;precision $delta m/m approx 10^{&#45;8}$ via the phase&#45;imaging&#10;ion&#45;cyclotron&#45;resonance technique, and represent an improvement of&#10;approximately an order of magnitude over previous measurements. These mass data&#10;were used in conjunction with the physically interpretable machine learning&#10;(PIML) model, which uses a mixture density neural network to model mass&#10;excesses via a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The effects of our new mass&#10;data on a Bayesian&#45;updating of a PIML model are presented.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12141v1) |&#10;| MoRAG &#45;&#45; Multi&#45;Fusion Retrieval Augmented Generation for Human Motion | Kalakonda Sai Shashank, Shubh Maheshwari, Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla | &#160;&#160;We introduce MoRAG, a novel multi&#45;part fusion based retrieval&#45;augmented&#10;generation strategy for text&#45;based human motion generation. The method enhances&#10;motion diffusion models by leveraging additional knowledge obtained through an&#10;improved motion retrieval process. By effectively prompting large language&#10;models (LLMs), we address spelling errors and rephrasing issues in motion&#10;retrieval. Our approach utilizes a multi&#45;part retrieval strategy to improve the&#10;generalizability of motion retrieval across the language space. We create&#10;diverse samples through the spatial composition of the retrieved motions.&#10;Furthermore, by utilizing low&#45;level, part&#45;specific motion information, we can&#10;construct motion samples for unseen text descriptions. Our experiments&#10;demonstrate that our framework can serve as a plug&#45;and&#45;play module, improving&#10;the performance of motion diffusion models.

In this&#10;report, we introduce Takin AudioLLM, a series of techniques and models, mainly&#10;including Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, specifically designed for&#10;audiobook production. These models are capable of zero&#45;shot speech production,&#10;generating high&#45;quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human&#10;speech and facilitating individuals to customize the speech content according&#10;to their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec&#10;language model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a&#10;multi&#45;task training framework, capable of generating high&#45;fidelity natural&#10;speech in a zero&#45;shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and&#10;timbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while&#10;advocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its&#10;naturalness and expressiveness. Last, we propose the Takin Morphing system with&#10;highly decoupled and advanced timbre and prosody modeling approaches, which&#10;enables individuals to customize speech production with their preferred timbre&#10;and prosody in a precise and controllable manner. Extensive experiments&#10;validate the effectiveness and robustness of our Takin AudioLLM series models.&#10;For detailed demos, please refer to https://takinaudiollm.github.io.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12139v1) |&#10;| GRIN: GRadient&#45;INformed MoE | Liyuan Liu, Young Jin Kim, Shuohang Wang, Chen Liang, Yelong Shen, Hao Cheng, Xiaodong Liu, Masahiro Tanaka, Xiaoxia Wu, Wenxiang Hu, Vishrav Chaudhary, Zeqi Lin, Chenruidong Zhang, Jilong Xue, Hany Awadalla, Jianfeng Gao, Weizhu Chen | &#160;&#160;Mixture&#45;of&#45;Experts (MoE) models scale more effectively than dense models due&#10;to sparse computation through expert routing, selectively activating only a&#10;small subset of expert modules. However, sparse computation challenges&#10;traditional training practices, as discrete expert routing hinders standard&#10;backpropagation and thus gradient&#45;based optimization, which are the cornerstone&#10;of deep learning. To better pursue the scaling power of MoE, we introduce GRIN&#10;(GRadient&#45;INformed MoE training), which incorporates sparse gradient estimation&#10;for expert routing and configures model parallelism to avoid token dropping.&#10;Applying GRIN to autoregressive language modeling, we develop a top&#45;2&#10;16$times$3.8B MoE model. Our model, with only 6.6B activated parameters,&#10;outperforms a 7B dense model and matches the performance of a 14B dense model&#10;trained on the same data. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks&#10;demonstrate the potential of GRIN to significantly enhance MoE efficacy,&#10;achieving 79.4 on MMLU, 83.7 on HellaSwag, 74.4 on HumanEval, and 58.9 on MATH.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12136v1) |&#10;| BERT&#45;VBD: Vietnamese Multi&#45;Document Summarization Framework | Tuan&#45;Cuong Vuong, Trang Mai Xuan, Thien Van Luong | &#160;&#160;In tackling the challenge of Multi&#45;Document Summarization (MDS), numerous&#10;methods have been proposed, spanning both extractive and abstractive&#10;summarization techniques. However, each approach has its own limitations,&#10;making it less effective to rely solely on either one. An emerging and&#10;promising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractive&#10;summarization methods. Despite the plethora of studies in this domain, research&#10;on the combined methodology remains scarce, particularly in the context of&#10;Vietnamese language processing. This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDS&#10;framework leveraging a two&#45;component pipeline architecture that integrates&#10;extractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs an&#10;extractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This is&#10;achieved by a modification of the pre&#45;trained BERT network, which derives&#10;semantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet network&#10;structures. The second component utilizes the VBD&#45;LLaMA2&#45;7B&#45;50b model for&#10;abstractive summarization, ultimately generating the final summary document.&#10;Our proposed framework demonstrates a positive performance, attaining ROUGE&#45;2&#10;scores of 39.6% on the VN&#45;MDS dataset and outperforming the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art&#10;baselines.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12134v1) |&#10;| Einstein&#45;dilaton&#45;four&#45;Maxwell Holographic Anisotropic Models | Irina Ya. Aref&#39;eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov | &#160;&#160;In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the&#10;five&#45;dimensional Einstein&#45;dilaton&#45;Maxwell models has played a crucial role.&#10;Typically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while&#10;additional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A&#10;more general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field&#10;represents spatial longitudinal&#45;transverse anisotropy, while the third and&#10;fourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We&#10;consider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero&#10;temperature and five functions at non&#45;zero temperature. Maxwell field related&#10;to the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,&#10;whereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.&#10;We demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of&#10;the seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations &#45;&#45; either the&#10;dilaton or the vector potential equation &#45;&#45; follows from the Einstein equations&#10;and the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi&#10;identity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress&#45;energy&#10;tensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is&#10;provided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to&#10;three Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis&#10;shows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein&#10;equations and the equation for the vector potential&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12131v1) |&#10;| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components&#10; &#160;for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco&#45;Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram | &#160;&#160;Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data&#10;together with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal&#10;components used. It is therefore important to determine the number of&#10;significant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a&#10;variational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for&#10;estimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of&#10;samples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This&#10;eliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of&#10;principal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.&#10;This framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows&#10;and columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),&#10;and with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data&#10;with arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as&#10;cultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our&#10;method on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may&#10;underestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the&#10;synthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical&#10;dataset. These results suggest that it is broadly applicable across the life&#10;sciences.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12129v1) |&#10;| Linguini: A benchmark for language&#45;agnostic linguistic reasoning | Eduardo Sánchez, Belen Alastruey, Christophe Ropers, Pontus Stenetorp, Mikel Artetxe, Marta R. Costa&#45;jussà | &#160;&#160;We propose a new benchmark to measure a language model&#39;s linguistic reasoning&#10;skills without relying on pre&#45;existing language&#45;specific knowledge. The test&#10;covers 894 questions grouped in 160 problems across 75 (mostly) extremely&#10;low&#45;resource languages, extracted from the International Linguistic Olympiad&#10;corpus. To attain high accuracy on this benchmark, models don&#39;t need previous&#10;knowledge of the tested language, as all the information needed to solve the&#10;linguistic puzzle is presented in the context. We find that, while all analyzed&#10;models rank below 25% accuracy, there is a significant gap between open and&#10;closed models, with the best&#45;performing proprietary model at 24.05% and the&#10;best&#45;performing open model at 8.84%.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12126v1) |&#10;| From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the&#10; &#160;primordial black hole reheating scenario | Guillem Domènech, Jan Tränkle | &#160;&#160;We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs&#10;originate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight&#10;PBHs with masses $M&#10;esssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat&#10;it via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate&#10;whether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH&#10;reheating contains information about the pre&#45;PBH&#45;dominated stage, namely the&#10;initial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer&#10;functions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and&#10;isocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation&#10;of state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH&#10;dominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the&#10;spectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive&#10;to $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density&#10;fluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance&#10;as a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)&#10;observations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the&#10;initial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we&#10;find that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several&#10;future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas,&#10;especially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any&#10;early matter&#45;dominated universe scenario.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12125v1) |&#10;| Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules | Anqi Zhang, Wilson S. Geisler | &#160;&#160;Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We&#10;investigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented&#10;displays having well&#45;separated potential target&#45;object locations. Performance&#10;was compared with the Bayesian&#45;optimal decision process under the assumption&#10;that the information from the different potential target locations is&#10;statistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than&#10;optimal, despite humans&#39; substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the&#10;implausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show&#10;that three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical&#10;results. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near&#10;optimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the&#10;central potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise&#10;causes search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These&#10;findings have far&#45;reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks&#10;and other identification tasks in humans and other animals.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12124v1) |&#10;| Far&#45;from&#45;equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann&#10; &#160;approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows&#10; &#160;$v_n$ | Vincenzo Nugara, Vincenzo Greco, Salvatore Plumari | &#160;&#160;We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal&#10;system in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution&#10;function and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system&#10;sizes $R$ and interaction strength $eta/s$ and identify universality classes&#10;based upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each&#10;of this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $hat&#10;gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results&#10;highlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum&#10;moments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to&#10;a 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of&#10;different sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a&#10;similar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse&#10;flow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system&#10;size and $eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and&#10;their response functions, along with the impact of the $eta/s$ and the system&#10;transverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in&#10;momentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow&#10;$v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of&#10;large opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems&#10;evolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play&#10;in this process.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12123v1) |&#10;| Qwen2.5&#45;Math Technical Report: Toward Mathematical Expert Model via&#10; &#160;Self&#45;Improvement | An Yang, Beichen Zhang, Binyuan Hui, Bofei Gao, Bowen Yu, Chengpeng Li, Dayiheng Liu, Jianhong Tu, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin, Keming Lu, Mingfeng Xue, Runji Lin, Tianyu Liu, Xingzhang Ren, Zhenru Zhang | &#160;&#160;In this report, we present a series of math&#45;specific large language models:&#10;Qwen2.5&#45;Math and Qwen2.5&#45;Math&#45;Instruct&#45;1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the&#10;Qwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self&#45;improvement&#10;throughout the entire pipeline, from pre&#45;training and post&#45;training to&#10;inference: (1) During the pre&#45;training phase, Qwen2&#45;Math&#45;Instruct is utilized&#10;to generate large&#45;scale, high&#45;quality mathematical data. (2) In the&#10;post&#45;training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive&#10;sampling from Qwen2&#45;Math&#45;Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative&#10;evolution of data in supervised fine&#45;tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model,&#10;it&#39;s possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the&#10;next round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the&#10;ultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5&#45;Math&#45;Instruct.&#10;(3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling,&#10;optimizing the model&#39;s performance.&#10; &#160;Qwen2.5&#45;Math&#45;Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced&#10;mathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain&#45;of&#45;Thought (CoT) and&#10;Tool&#45;Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics&#10;datasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and&#10;AIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math&#10;competition problems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12122v1) |&#10;| Computing the $mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two&#45;Dimensional&#10; &#160;Strongly&#45;Correlated Systems | Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn | &#160;&#160;We show that the two&#45;dimensional $mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time&#45;reversal&#10;invariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary&#45;condition&#10;dependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non&#45;interacting and&#10;strongly&#45;correlated insulators. By introducing a family of quasi&#45;single&#10;particle states associated to the many&#45;body ground state of an insulator, we&#10;show that the $mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant can be expressed as the integral of a&#10;certain Berry connection over half the space of boundary conditions, providing&#10;an alternative expression to the formulations that appear in [Lee et al., Phys.&#10;Rev. Lett. $textbf{100}$, 186807 (2008)]. We show the equivalence of the&#10;different many&#45;body formulations of the invariant, and show how they reduce to&#10;known band&#45;theoretic results for Slater determinant ground states. Finally, we&#10;apply our results to analytically calculate the invariant for the Kane&#45;Mele&#10;model with nonlocal (orbital) Hatsugai&#45;Kohmoto (HK) interactions. This&#10;rigorously establishes the topological nontriviality of the Kane&#45;Mele model&#10;with HK interactions, and represents one of the few exact calculations of the&#10;$mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a strongly&#45;interacting system.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12120v1) |&#10;| Weak Lensing analysis of Abell 2390 using short exposures | A. Dutta, J. R. Peterson, T. Rose, M. Cianfaglione, A. Bonafede, G. Li, G. Sembroski | &#160;&#160;We present a weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 2390 at z =&#10;0.23 using second moment shape measurements made in 411 short 60s exposures.&#10;The exposures are obtained in three broadband photometric filters (g, r, i)&#10;using WIYN&#45;ODI. Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a&#10;moment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching&#10;algorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The&#10;measurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight&#10;to obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim&#10;simulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find&#10;the mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We&#10;also find the E&#45;Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic&#10;structures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical&#10;and X&#45;Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to&#10;map large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of&#10;the cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the&#10;peaks are similar to X&#45;Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster&#10;and show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12119v1) |&#10;| Low Frame&#45;rate Speech Codec: a Codec Designed for Fast High&#45;quality&#10; &#160;Speech LLM Training and Inference | Edresson Casanova, Ryan Langman, Paarth Neekhara, Shehzeen Hussain, Jason Li, Subhankar Ghosh, Ante Jukić, Sang&#45;gil Lee | &#160;&#160;Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing&#10;through audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the&#10;application of language modeling techniques to audio data. However, audio&#10;codecs often operate at high frame rates, resulting in slow training and&#10;inference, especially for autoregressive models. To address this challenge, we&#10;present the Low Frame&#45;rate Speech Codec (LFSC): a neural audio codec that&#10;leverages finite scalar quantization and adversarial training with large speech&#10;language models to achieve high&#45;quality audio compression with a 1.89 kbps&#10;bitrate and 21.5 frames per second. We demonstrate that our novel codec can&#10;make the inference of LLM&#45;based text&#45;to&#45;speech models around three times faster&#10;while improving intelligibility and producing quality comparable to previous&#10;models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12117v1) |&#10;| Stronger Baseline Models &#45;&#45; A Key Requirement for Aligning Machine&#10; &#160;Learning Research with Clinical Utility | Nathan Wolfrath, Joel Wolfrath, Hengrui Hu, Anjishnu Banerjee, Anai N. Kothari | &#160;&#160;Machine Learning (ML) research has increased substantially in recent years,&#10;due to the success of predictive modeling across diverse application domains.&#10;However, well&#45;known barriers exist when attempting to deploy ML models in&#10;high&#45;stakes, clinical settings, including lack of model transparency (or the&#10;inability to audit the inference process), large training data requirements&#10;with siloed data sources, and complicated metrics for measuring model utility.&#10;In this work, we show empirically that including stronger baseline models in&#10;healthcare ML evaluations has important downstream effects that aid&#10;practitioners in addressing these challenges. Through a series of case studies,&#10;we find that the common practice of omitting baselines or comparing against a&#10;weak baseline model (e.g. a linear model with no optimization) obscures the&#10;value of ML methods proposed in the research literature. Using these insights,&#10;we propose some best practices that will enable practitioners to more&#10;effectively study and deploy ML models in clinical settings.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12116v1) |&#10;| Revisiting Dark Photon Constraints from CMB Spectral Distortions | Jens Chluba, Bryce Cyr, Matthew C. Johnson | &#160;&#160;Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide&#10;stringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post&#45;BBN (Big&#10;Bang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models&#10;with COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.&#10;Here, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark&#10;photon conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous&#10;works only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the&#10;change to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon&#10;distortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the&#10;distortion has an opposite sign and a $simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We&#10;furthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover&#10;the redshift range $simeq 2times 10^6&#45;4times 10^7$ between the $mu$&#45;era and&#10;the end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints&#10;for dark photon masses in the range $10^{&#45;4},{&#13;m eV}&#10;esssim m_{&#13;m&#10;dp}&#10;esssim 10^{&#45;3},{&#13;m eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We&#10;demonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon&#10;to dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $mu$&#45;type distortion&#10;independent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study&#10;dark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with&#10;CMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12115v1) |&#10;| Bi&#45;objective trail&#45;planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous&#10; &#160;environment | Cory M. Simon, Jeffrey Richley, Lucas Overbey, Darleen Perez&#45;Lavin | &#160;&#160;Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in&#10;resource delivery, patrolling, information&#45;gathering, agriculture, forest fire&#10;fighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and&#10;search&#45;and&#45;rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments &#45;&#45; with e.g.&#10;rough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or&#10;capturing robots &#45;&#45; should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of&#10;risks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should&#10;take the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the&#10;team&#45;level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward&#10;from visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider&#10;bi&#45;objective trail&#45;planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a&#10;hazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed&#10;graph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of&#10;survival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a&#10;robot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for&#10;the Pareto&#45;optimal robot&#45;team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team&#10;objectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive&#10;the mission. A human decision&#45;maker can then select trail plans that balance,&#10;according to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony&#10;optimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto&#45;optimal set of&#10;robot team trail plans. As a case study, we illustrate with an&#10;information&#45;gathering mission in an art museum.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12114v1) |&#10;| Pareto Data Framework: Steps Towards Resource&#45;Efficient Decision Making&#10; &#160;Using Minimum Viable Data (MVD) | Tashfain Ahmed, Josh Siegel | &#160;&#160;This paper introduces the Pareto Data Framework, an approach for identifying&#10;and selecting the Minimum Viable Data (MVD) required for enabling machine&#10;learning applications on constrained platforms such as embedded systems, mobile&#10;devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We demonstrate that strategic&#10;data reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing&#10;bandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies&#10;Minimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource&#45;constrained&#10;environments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient&#10;practices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and&#10;overprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for&#10;optimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data&#10;representation. An experimental methodology demonstrates effective acoustic&#10;data characterization after downsampling, quantization, and truncation to&#10;simulate reduced&#45;fidelity sensors and network and storage constraints; results&#10;shows that performance can be maintained up to 95% with sample rates reduced&#10;by 75% and bit depths and clip length reduced by 50% which translates into&#10;substantial cost and resource reduction. These findings have implications on&#10;the design and development of constrained systems. The paper also discusses&#10;broader implications of the framework, including the potential to democratize&#10;advanced AI technologies across IoT applications and sectors such as&#10;agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing to improve access and multiply&#10;the benefits of data&#45;driven insights.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12112v1) |&#10;| Applications of Knowledge Distillation in Remote Sensing: A Survey | Yassine Himeur, Nour Aburaed, Omar Elharrouss, Iraklis Varlamis, Shadi Atalla, Wathiq Mansoor, Hussain Al Ahmad | &#160;&#160;With the ever&#45;growing complexity of models in the field of remote sensing&#10;(RS), there is an increasing demand for solutions that balance model accuracy&#10;with computational efficiency. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a&#10;powerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,&#10;complex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in&#10;performance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and&#10;its innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer&#10;knowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact&#10;and efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application&#10;across various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and&#10;historical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are&#10;highlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational&#10;efficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical&#10;deployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of&#10;KD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the&#10;breadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case&#10;studies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,&#10;such as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review&#10;discusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical&#10;constraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive&#10;overview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS. Through this&#10;organization, the paper not only elucidates the current state of research in KD&#10;but also sets the stage for future research opportunities, thereby contributing&#10;significantly to both academic research and real&#45;world applications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12111v1) |&#10;| It depends: Varieties of defining growth dependence | Anja Janischewski, Katharina Bohnenberger, Matthias Kranke, Tobias Vogel, Riwan Driouich, Tobias Froese, Stefanie Gerold, Raphael Kaufmann, Lorenz Keyßer, Jannis Niethammer, Christopher Olk, Matthias Schmelzer, Aslı Yürük, Steffen Lange | &#160;&#160;Many socio&#45;economic systems require positive economic growth rates to&#10;function properly. Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing&#10;evidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,&#10;these growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,&#10;more and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth&#45;dependent systems&#10;and develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of&#10;&#39;growth dependence&#39; still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,&#10;which impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article&#10;proposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the&#10;concept of &#39;growth dependence&#39; across socio&#45;economic systems. We provide a&#10;general definition consisting of four components that can be specified for&#10;different empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of&#10;measurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions&#10;or properties of the system under investigation. According to our general&#10;definition, a socio&#45;economic system is growth&#45;dependent if it requires a&#10;long&#45;term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to&#10;maintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen&#10;normative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to&#10;three areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:&#10;employment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies&#10;demonstrate that whether or not a system is growth&#45;dependent hinges not only on&#10;the empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of&#10;the concept of growth dependence. Our framework enables coherent, robust and&#10;effective definitions and research questions, fostering comparability of&#10;findings across different cases and disciplines.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12109v1) |&#10;| SPRMamba: Surgical Phase Recognition for Endoscopic Submucosal&#10; &#160;Dissection with Mamba | Xiangning Zhang, Jinnan Chen, Qingwei Zhang, Chengfeng Zhou, Zhengjie Zhang, Xiaobo Li, Dahong Qian | &#160;&#160;Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive procedure&#10;initially designed for the treatment of early gastric cancer but is now widely&#10;used for various gastrointestinal lesions. Computer&#45;assisted Surgery systems&#10;have played a crucial role in improving the precision and safety of ESD&#10;procedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognition&#10;of surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesion&#10;characteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real&#45;time&#10;surgical phase recognition algorithms. Existing surgical phase recognition&#10;algorithms struggle to efficiently capture temporal contexts in video&#45;based&#10;scenarios, leading to insufficient performance. To address these issues, we&#10;propose SPRMamba, a novel Mamba&#45;based framework for ESD surgical phase&#10;recognition. SPRMamba leverages the strengths of Mamba for long&#45;term temporal&#10;modeling while introducing the Scaled Residual TranMamba block to enhance the&#10;capture of fine&#45;grained details, overcoming the limitations of traditional&#10;temporal models like Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformers.&#10;Moreover, a Temporal Sample Strategy is introduced to accelerate the&#10;processing, which is essential for real&#45;time phase recognition in clinical&#10;settings. Extensive testing on the ESD385 dataset and the cholecystectomy&#10;Cholec80 dataset demonstrates that SPRMamba surpasses existing state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art&#10;methods and exhibits greater robustness across various surgical phase&#10;recognition tasks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12108v1) |&#10;| Who&#39;s the GOAT? Sports Rankings and Data&#45;Driven Random Walks on the&#10; &#160;Symmetric Group | Gian&#45;Gabriel P. Garcia, J. Carlos Martínez Mori | &#160;&#160;Given a collection of historical sports rankings, can one tell which player&#10;is the greatest of all time (i.e., the GOAT)? In this work, we design a&#10;data&#45;driven random walk on the symmetric group to obtain a stationary&#10;distribution over player rankings, spanning across different time periods in&#10;sports history. We combine this distribution with a notion of stochastic&#10;dominance to obtain a partial order over the players.

Recent advances in AI have sparked renewed interest in this area, with&#10;large language models (LLMs) emerging as both tools and subjects of value&#10;measurement. This work introduces Generative Psychometrics for Values (GPV), an&#10;LLM&#45;based, data&#45;driven value measurement paradigm, theoretically grounded in&#10;text&#45;revealed selective perceptions. We begin by fine&#45;tuning an LLM for&#10;accurate perception&#45;level value measurement and verifying the capability of&#10;LLMs to parse texts into perceptions, forming the core of the GPV pipeline.&#10;Applying GPV to human&#45;authored blogs, we demonstrate its stability, validity,&#10;and superiority over prior psychological tools. Then, extending GPV to LLM&#10;value measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometric&#10;methodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free&#45;form&#10;outputs, enabling context&#45;specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis of&#10;measurement paradigms, indicating response biases of prior methods; and 3) an&#10;attempt to bridge LLM values and their safety, revealing the predictive power&#10;of different value systems and the impacts of various values on LLM safety.&#10;Through interdisciplinary efforts, we aim to leverage AI for next&#45;generation&#10;psychometrics and psychometrics for value&#45;aligned AI.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12106v1) |&#10;| FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated&#10; &#160;Long&#45;Tailed Learning | Xiuhua Lu, Peng Li, Xuefeng Jiang | &#160;&#160;Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy&#10;in distributed machine learning. However, datasets distributed across each&#10;client in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can&#10;be globally aggregated, they tend to be long&#45;tailed distributed, which greatly&#10;affects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated&#10;learning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it&#10;fails to address the phenomenon of class&#45;wise bias in global long&#45;tailed data.&#10;This results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting&#10;the equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a&#10;methodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,&#10;we propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the&#10;local training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred&#10;optimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art&#10;methods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long&#45;tailed&#10;distribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR&#45;10&#45;LT and&#10;CIFAR&#45;100&#45;LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of&#10;model performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long&#45;tailed&#10;distribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12105v1) |&#10;| Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error&#10; &#160;Detection | Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia | &#160;&#160;Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real&#45;world applications. Doing&#10;so requires overcoming the noise present on today&#39;s hardware. The quantum&#10;approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling&#10;up due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup&#10;over state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art classical algorithms for some problems. However,&#10;achieving better&#45;than&#45;classical performance with QAOA is believed to require&#10;fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault&#45;tolerant&#10;implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg&#39;&#39; error detection&#10;code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the&#10;algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with&#10;up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped&#45;ion quantum computer. Additionally, we&#10;propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance, and use it&#10;to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance&#10;to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our&#10;model can be used to determine necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform&#10;Goemans&#45;Williamson algorithm on future hardware. Our results demonstrate the&#10;largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially&#10;fault&#45;tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date,&#10;paving the way towards solving real&#45;world applications with quantum computers.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12104v1) |&#10;| Cyclicity Analysis of the Ornstein&#45;Uhlenbeck Process | Vivek Kaushik | &#160;&#160;In this thesis, we consider an $N$&#45;dimensional Ornstein&#45;Uhlenbeck (OU)&#10;process satisfying the linear stochastic differential equation $dmathbf x(t) =&#10;&#45; mathbf Bmathbf x(t) dt + boldsymbol Sigma d mathbf w(t).$ Here, $mathbf&#10;B$ is a fixed $N times N$ circulant friction matrix whose eigenvalues have&#10;positive real parts, $boldsymbol Sigma$ is a fixed $N times M$ matrix. We&#10;consider a signal propagation model governed by this OU process. In this model,&#10;an underlying signal propagates throughout a network consisting of $N$ linked&#10;sensors located in space. We interpret the $n$&#45;th component of the OU process&#10;as the measurement of the propagating effect made by the $n$&#45;th sensor. The&#10;matrix $mathbf B$ represents the sensor network structure: if $mathbf B$ has&#10;first row $(b_1 &#160;, &#160;dots &#160;, &#160;b_N),$ where $b_1&gt;0$ and $b_2 &#160;, &#160;dots , b_N &#10;e 0,$ then the magnitude of $b_p$ quantifies how receptive the $n$&#45;th&#10;sensor is to activity within the $(n+p&#45;1)$&#45;th sensor. Finally, the $(m,n)$&#45;th&#10;entry of the matrix $mathbf D = frac{boldsymbol Sigma boldsymbol&#10;Sigma^text T}{2}$ is the covariance of the component noises injected into the&#10;$m$&#45;th and $n$&#45;th sensors. For different choices of $mathbf B$ and&#10;$boldsymbol Sigma,$ we investigate whether Cyclicity Analysis enables us to&#10;recover the structure of network. Roughly speaking, Cyclicity Analysis studies&#10;the lead&#45;lag dynamics pertaining to the components of a multivariate signal. We&#10;specifically consider an $N times N$ skew&#45;symmetric matrix $mathbf Q,$ known&#10;as the lead matrix, in which the sign of its $(m,n)$&#45;th entry captures the&#10;lead&#45;lag relationship between the $m$&#45;th and $n$&#45;th component OU processes. We&#10;investigate whether the structure of the leading eigenvector of $mathbf Q,$&#10;the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of $mathbf Q$ in&#10;modulus, reflects the network structure induced by $mathbf B.$&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12102v1) |&#10;| Symmetry&#45;Enriched Learning: A Category&#45;Theoretic Framework for Robust&#10; &#160;Machine Learning Models | Ronald Katende | &#160;&#160;This manuscript presents a novel framework that integrates higher&#45;order&#10;symmetries and category theory into machine learning.

Through rigorous proofs and&#10;practical applications, we demonstrate that incorporating higher&#45;dimensional&#10;categorical structures enhances both the theoretical foundations and practical&#10;capabilities of modern machine learning algorithms, opening new directions for&#10;research and innovation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12100v1) |&#10;| Brain&#45;Streams: fMRI&#45;to&#45;Image Reconstruction with Multi&#45;modal Guidance | Jaehoon Joo, Taejin Jeong, Seongjae Hwang | &#160;&#160;Understanding how humans process visual information is one of the crucial&#10;steps for unraveling the underlying mechanism of brain activity. Recently, this&#10;curiosity has motivated the fMRI&#45;to&#45;image reconstruction task; given the fMRI&#10;data from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual&#10;stimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent&#10;Diffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex&#10;visual stimuli such as high&#45;resolution natural images from vision datasets.&#10;Despite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often&#10;lack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.&#10;Consequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere&#10;visuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs&#10;effectively incorporate multi&#45;modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,&#10;and image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image&#10;generations. Specifically, inspired by the two&#45;streams hypothesis suggesting&#10;that perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain&#10;regions, our framework, Brain&#45;Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain&#10;regions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from&#10;semantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information&#10;regions, Brain&#45;Streams provides accurate multi&#45;modal guidance to LDMs. We&#10;validate the reconstruction ability of Brain&#45;Streams both quantitatively and&#10;qualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI&#10;data.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12099v1) |&#10;| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal&#10; &#160;execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huyên Pham | &#160;&#160;Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and&#10;constraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity&#10;markets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general&#10;propagator model under linear functional inequality constraints. The optimal&#10;control is given explicitly in terms of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers&#10;and their conditional expectations, as a solution to a linear stochastic&#10;Fredholm equation. We propose a stochastic version of the Uzawa algorithm on&#10;the dual problem to construct the stochastic Lagrange multipliers numerically&#10;via a stochastic projected gradient ascent, combined with a least&#45;squares Monte&#10;Carlo regression step to approximate their conditional expectations. We&#10;illustrate our findings on two different practical applications with stochastic&#10;signals: (i) an optimal execution problem with an exponential or a power law&#10;decaying transient impact, with either a `no&#45;shorting&#39; constraint in the&#10;presence of a `sell&#39; signal, a `no&#45;buying&#39; constraint in the presence of a&#10;`buy&#39; signal or a stochastic `stop&#45;trading&#39; constraint whenever the exogenous&#10;price drops below a specified reference level; (ii) a battery storage problem&#10;with instantaneous operating costs, seasonal signals and fixed constraints on&#10;both the charging power and the load capacity of the battery.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12098v1) |&#10;| Skill matching at scale: freelancer&#45;project alignment for efficient&#10; &#160;multilingual candidate retrieval | Warren Jouanneau, Marc Palyart, Emma Jouffroy | &#160;&#160;Finding the perfect match between a job proposal and a set of freelancers is&#10;not an easy task to perform at scale, especially in multiple languages.

The task of&#10;next&#45;best&#45;view (NBV) planning is to infer the pose of the next viewpoint based&#10;on the current data, and gradually realize the complete three&#45;dimensional&#10;reconstruction. Many existing algorithms, however, suffer a large computational&#10;burden due to the use of ray&#45;casting. To address this, this paper proposes a&#10;projection&#45;based NBV planning framework. It can select the next best view at an&#10;extremely fast speed while ensuring the complete scanning of the object.&#10;Specifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into&#10;ellipsoids based on the voxel structure.Then, the next best view is selected&#10;from the candidate views using a projection&#45;based viewpoint quality evaluation&#10;function in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy. This process&#10;replaces the ray&#45;casting in voxel structures, significantly improving the&#10;computational efficiency. Comparative experiments with other algorithms in a&#10;simulation environment show that the framework proposed in this paper can&#10;achieve 10 times efficiency improvement on the basis of capturing roughly the&#10;same coverage. The real&#45;world experimental results also prove the efficiency&#10;and feasibility of the framework.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12096v1) |&#10;| Undersampling effects on observed periods of coronal oscillations | Daye Lim, Tom Van Doorsselaere, Valery M. Nakariakov, Dmitrii Y. Kolotkov, Yuhang Gao, David Berghmans | &#160;&#160;Context. Recent observations of decayless transverse oscillations have shown&#10;two branches in the relationship between periods and loop lengths. One is a&#10;linear relationship, interpreted as a standing mode. The other shows almost no&#10;correlation and has not yet been interpreted conclusively. Aims. We&#10;investigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless&#10;oscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely&#10;follow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations&#10;are standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations&#10;where the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase&#10;are randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal&#10;by considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of&#10;telescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast&#10;Fourier transform. Results. When the sampling cadence is getting closer to the&#10;actual oscillation period, a tendency for overestimating periods in short loops&#10;is enhanced. The relationship between loop lengths and periods of the sampled&#10;signals shows the two branches as in the observation. Conclusions. We find that&#10;long periods of decayless oscillations occurring in short loops could be the&#10;result of undersampling.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12095v1) |&#10;| Enwrapped Perylene Bisimide Enables Room Temperature Polariton Lasing&#10; &#160;and Photonic Lattices | Dominik Horneber, Johannes Düreth, Tim Schembri, Simon Betzold, Matthias Stolte, Sven Höfling, Frank Würthner, Sebastian Klembt | &#160;&#160;Perylene bisimides (PBIs) are organic dyes with photoluminescence quantum&#10;yields (PLQY) close to unity in solution and great thermal and photo&#45;chemical&#10;stability. These features alongside the tunability of their solid&#45;state packing&#10;arrangement via chemical functionalization make this material class an&#10;excellent candidate for exciton&#45;polariton lasing at room temperature. Polariton&#10;lasing is well understood in III&#45;V semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures,&#10;however, the search for emitter materials for robust and versatile room&#10;temperature applications is ongoing. While e.g. perovskites and several organic&#10;materials have been identified to support polariton lasing, many of these&#10;materials lack tunability and long&#45;term stability under ambient conditions.&#10;Here, we fabricate optical microcavities using a strongly enwrapped PBI&#10;chromophore with prevailing monomer&#45;like absorption and emission properties in&#10;the solid state. Voluminous bay&#45;substituents prevent stacking induced&#10;PLQY&#45;quenching, thereby enabling polariton lasing at room temperature.&#10;Additionally, photonic confinement in single hemispheric resonators is&#10;demonstrated leading to localized polaritonic modes with discrete energies, as&#10;well as optical lattices revealing distinct polaritonic band&#45;structures. Due to&#10;the possibility of tunable properties by the precise control of the solid&#45;state&#10;packing arrangement of PBI emitters, our results pave the way for&#10;polarization&#45;dependent light&#45;matter coupling, including topological photonic&#10;effects within oriented crystalline thin&#45;film microcavity structures.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12093v1) |&#10;| IMRL: Integrating Visual, Physical, Temporal, and Geometric&#10; &#160;Representations for Enhanced Food Acquisition | Rui Liu, Zahiruddin Mahammad, Amisha Bhaskar, Pratap Tokekar | &#160;&#160;Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality&#10;of life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse&#10;food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents&#10;unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface&#45;level geometric&#10;information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g.,&#10;color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially&#10;when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance.&#10;We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition.&#10;Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy&#10;based on off&#45;the&#45;shelf image encoders such as ResNet&#45;50. However, such&#10;representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse&#10;acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel&#10;approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi&#45;Dimensional Representation Learning), which&#10;integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance&#10;the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach&#10;captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi&#45;solid, granular,&#10;liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and&#10;introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and&#10;assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies&#10;based on context, improving the robot&#39;s capability to handle diverse food&#10;acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach&#39;s&#10;robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations,&#10;including zero&#45;shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves&#10;improvement up to $35%$ in success rate compared with the best&#45;performing&#10;baseline.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12092v1) |&#10;| Uncovering liquid&#45;substrate fluctuation effects on crystal growth and&#10; &#160;disordered hyperuniformity of two&#45;dimensional materials | S.

Here we find that the&#10;ordering in which elements are presented to the language model is surprisingly&#10;impactful&#45;&#45;randomizing element ordering in a webpage degrades agent performance&#10;comparably to removing all visible text from an agent&#39;s state representation.&#10;While a webpage provides a hierarchical ordering of elements, there is no such&#10;ordering when parsing elements directly from pixels. Moreover, as tasks become&#10;more challenging and models more sophisticated, our experiments suggest that&#10;the impact of ordering increases. Finding an effective ordering is non&#45;trivial.&#10;We investigate the impact of various element ordering methods in web and&#10;desktop environments. We find that dimensionality reduction provides a viable&#10;ordering for pixel&#45;only environments. We train a UI element detection model to&#10;derive elements from pixels and apply our findings to an agent&#10;benchmark&#45;&#45;OmniACT&#45;&#45;where we only have access to pixels. Our method completes&#10;more than two times as many tasks on average relative to the previous&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12089v2) |&#10;| Quark saturation in the QCD phase diagram | Marcus Bluhm, Yuki Fujimoto, Larry McLerran, Marlene Nahrgang | &#160;&#160;We determine the onset of Quarkyonic Matter corresponding to values of&#10;temperature and baryon chemical potential at which the quark phase space&#10;density becomes one. At zero temperature for baryon chemical potentials below&#10;the mass of the Lambda baryon, only nucleons contribute to the quark density.&#10;This is different at finite temperature, where all baryons, mesons and their&#10;resonances can be excited and thus add quarks to the phase space. The&#10;probability density to find a quark inside a hadron is determined using the&#10;Yukawa ansatz of the IdylliQ model of Quarkyonic Matter. We estimate separately&#10;the magnitude of the various contributions of nucleons, Delta baryons, pions as&#10;well as further hadrons and resonances. The uncertainty in the parametrization&#10;of the probability density to find a quark inside a nucleon is spanned by&#10;assuming that at zero temperature the transition density to Quarkyonic Matter&#10;is between one and three times that of nuclear matter. Various predictions for&#10;a possible critical point associated with the chiral phase transition are found&#10;close to a triple point at which the line of the deconfinement transition and&#10;the curve associated with the transition to Quarkyonic Matter intersect. These&#10;considerations provide an estimate for the region in the QCD phase diagram&#10;where Quarkyonic Matter may be found.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12088v1) |&#10;| Towards Interpretable End&#45;Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Prediction:&#10; &#160;Utilizing Administrative Claims Data with Explainable AI Techniques | Yubo Li, Saba Al&#45;Sayouri, Rema Padman | &#160;&#160;This study explores the potential of utilizing administrative claims data,&#10;combined with advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, to&#10;predict the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to End&#45;Stage Renal&#10;Disease (ESRD). We analyze a comprehensive, 10&#45;year dataset provided by a major&#10;health insurance organization to develop prediction models for multiple&#10;observation windows using traditional machine learning methods such as Random&#10;Forest and XGBoost as well as deep learning approaches such as Long Short&#45;Term&#10;Memory (LSTM) networks. Our findings demonstrate that the LSTM model,&#10;particularly with a 24&#45;month observation window, exhibits superior performance&#10;in predicting ESRD progression, outperforming existing models in the&#10;literature. We further apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to&#10;enhance interpretability, providing insights into the impact of individual&#10;features on predictions at the individual patient level. This study underscores&#10;the value of leveraging administrative claims data for CKD management and&#10;predicting ESRD progression.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12087v1) |&#10;| Unveiling the Secrets of New Physics Through Top Quark Tagging | Rameswar Sahu, Saiyad Ashanujjaman, Kirtiman Ghosh | &#160;&#160;The ubiquity of top&#45;rich final states in the context of beyond the Standard&#10;Model (BSM) searches has led to their status as extensively studied signatures&#10;at the LHC. Over the past decade, numerous endeavours have been undertaken in&#10;the literature to develop methods for efficiently distinguishing boosted top&#10;quark jets from QCD jets. Although cut&#45;based strategies for boosted top&#10;tagging, which rely on substructure information from fat jets resulting from&#10;the hadronic decay of boosted top quarks, were introduced in the literature as&#10;early as 2008, recent years have witnessed a surge in the utilization of&#10;machine learning&#45;based approaches for the classification of top&#45;jets from QCD&#10;jets.

We solve the inverse problem modeling the distribution&#10;amplitude, and we match our results to the light&#45;cone in the&#10;$overline{text{MS}}$&#45;scheme. We include a complete error budget, and we&#10;compare to two alternative approaches: non&#45;relativistic QCD and Dyson&#45;Schwinger&#10;equations, finding good agreement with the latter but not with the former.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12084v1) |&#10;| The asymptotic behavior of solutions to a doubly degenerate&#10; &#160;chemotaxis&#45;consumption system in two&#45;dimensional setting | Duan Wu | &#160;&#160;The present work proceeds to consider the convergence of the solutions to the&#10;following doubly degenerate chemotaxis&#45;consumption system begin{align*}&#10;&#10;eft{ begin{array}{r@{,}l@{quad}l@{,}c}&#10;&amp;u_{t}=&#10;ablacdotbig(u^{m&#45;1}v&#10;abla vbig)&#45;&#10;ablacdotbig(f(u)v&#10;abla&#10;vbig)+ell uv,\ &amp;v_{t}=Delta v&#45;uv, end{array}&#13;ight.%} end{align*} under&#10;no&#45;flux boundary conditions in a smoothly bounded convex domain $Omegasubset&#10;R^2$, where the nonnegative function $fin C^1([0,infty))$ is asked to&#10;satisfy $f(s)&#10;e C_fs^{al}$ with $al, C_f&gt;0$ for all $sge 1$.&#10; &#160;The global existence of weak solutions or classical solutions to the above&#10;system has been established in both one&#45; and two&#45;dimensional bounded convex&#10;domains in previous works. However, the results concerning the large time&#10;behavior are still constrained to one dimension due to the lack of a&#10;Harnack&#45;type inequality in the two&#45;dimensional case.

Agyeman, Jinfeng Liu, Sirish L. Shah | &#160;&#160;Efficient water management in agriculture is important for mitigating the&#10;growing freshwater scarcity crisis. Mixed&#45;integer Model Predictive Control&#10;(MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex&#10;scheduling problems in agricultural irrigation. However, the computational&#10;complexity of mixed&#45;integer MPC still poses a significant challenge,&#10;particularly in large&#45;scale applications. This study proposes an approach to&#10;enhance the computational efficiency of mixed&#45;integer MPC&#45;based irrigation&#10;schedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture&#10;dynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed&#45;integer linear&#10;representation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the&#10;mixed&#45;integer MPC&#45;based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a&#10;mixed&#45;integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed&#45;integer&#10;nonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global&#10;optimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated&#10;through comparative studies conducted on a large&#45;scale agricultural field&#10;across two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models,&#10;specifically Long Short&#45;Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used&#10;triggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU&#45;based approach significantly&#10;reduces solution times &#45;&#45; by up to 99.5% &#45;&#45; while achieving comparable&#10;performance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water&#10;Use Efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, the ReLU&#45;based approach maintains enhanced&#10;performance in terms of total prescribed irrigation and IWUE compared to the&#10;widely&#45;used triggered irrigation scheduling method.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12082v1) |&#10;| Design of Ligand&#45;Binding Proteins with Atomic Flow Matching | Junqi Liu, Shaoning Li, Chence Shi, Zhi Yang, Jian Tang | &#160;&#160;Designing novel proteins that bind to small molecules is a long&#45;standing&#10;challenge in computational biology, with applications in developing catalysts,&#10;biosensors, and more. Current computational methods rely on the assumption that&#10;the binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible,&#10;as conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon&#10;binding. In this work, we formulate proteins and molecules as unified&#10;biotokens, and present AtomFlow, a novel deep generative model under the&#10;flow&#45;matching framework for the design of ligand&#45;binding proteins from the 2D&#10;target molecular graph alone. Operating on representative atoms of biotokens,&#10;AtomFlow captures the flexibility of ligands and generates ligand conformations&#10;and protein backbone structures iteratively. We consider the multi&#45;scale nature&#10;of biotokens and demonstrate that AtomFlow can be effectively trained on a&#10;subset of structures from the Protein Data Bank, by matching flow vector field&#10;using an SE(3) equivariant structure prediction network. Experimental results&#10;show that our method can generate high fidelity ligand&#45;binding proteins and&#10;achieve performance comparable to the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art model RFDiffusionAA,&#10;while not requiring bound ligand structures. As a general framework, AtomFlow&#10;holds the potential to be applied to various biomolecule generation tasks in&#10;the future.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12080v1) |&#10;| Denoising diffusion models for high&#45;resolution microscopy image&#10; &#160;restoration | Pamela Osuna&#45;Vargas, Maren H. Wehrheim, Lucas Zinz, Johanna Rahm, Ashwin Balakrishnan, Alexandra Kaminer, Mike Heilemann, Matthias Kaschube | &#160;&#160;Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at&#10;the nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological&#10;organization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of&#10;fluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses&#10;remain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced&#10;laser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and&#10;increased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a&#10;denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high&#45;resolution&#10;images by conditioning the model on low&#45;resolution information. Additionally,&#10;the probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images&#10;that tend to further increase the signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio. We show that our model&#10;achieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously&#10;best&#45;performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly,&#10;while any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but&#10;not all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all&#10;four data sets, suggesting high generalizability.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12078v1) |&#10;| Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Via Data Pruning | Andrea Napoli, Paul White | &#160;&#160;The removal of carefully&#45;selected examples from training data has recently&#10;emerged as an effective way of improving the robustness of machine learning&#10;models. However, the best way to select these examples remains an open&#10;question. In this paper, we consider the problem from the perspective of&#10;unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). We propose AdaPrune, a method for UDA&#10;whereby training examples are removed to attempt to align the training&#10;distribution to that of the target data. By adopting the maximum mean&#10;discrepancy (MMD) as the criterion for alignment, the problem can be neatly&#10;formulated and solved as an integer quadratic program. We evaluate our approach&#10;on a real&#45;world domain shift task of bioacoustic event detection. As a method&#10;for UDA, we show that AdaPrune outperforms related techniques, and is&#10;complementary to other UDA algorithms such as CORAL. Our analysis of the&#10;relationship between the MMD and model accuracy, along with t&#45;SNE plots,&#10;validate the proposed method as a principled and well&#45;founded way of performing&#10;data pruning.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12076v1) |&#10;| The elastica sling | Alessandro Cazzolli, Francesco Dal Corso | &#160;&#160;The nonlinear mechanics of a flexible elastic rod constrained at its edges by&#10;a pair of sliding sleeves is analyzed. The planar equilibrium configurations of&#10;this variable&#45;length elastica are found to have shape defined only by the&#10;inclination of the two constraints, while their distance is responsible only&#10;for scaling the size. By extending the theoretical stability criterion&#10;available for systems under isoperimetric constraints to the case of variable&#10;domains, the existence of no more than one stable equilibrium solution is&#10;revealed. The set of sliding sleeves&#39; inclination pairs for which the stability&#10;is lost are identified. Such critical conditions allow the indefinite ejection&#10;of the flexible rod from the sliding sleeves, thus realizing an elastica sling.&#10;Finally, the theoretical findings are validated by experiments on a physical&#10;prototype. The present results lead to a novel actuation principle that may&#10;find application as a mechanism in energy harvesting, wave mitigation devices,&#10;and soft robotic locomotion.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12075v1) |&#10;| Online Refractive Camera Model Calibration in Visual Inertial Odometry | Mohit Singh, Kostas Alexis | &#160;&#160;This paper presents a general refractive camera model and online&#10;co&#45;estimation of odometry and the refractive index of unknown media. This&#10;enables operation in diverse and varying refractive fluids, given only the&#10;camera calibration in air. The refractive index is estimated online as a state&#10;variable of a monocular visual&#45;inertial odometry framework in an iterative&#10;formulation using the proposed camera model. The method was verified on data&#10;collected using an underwater robot traversing inside a pool. The evaluations&#10;demonstrate convergence to the ideal refractive index for water despite&#10;significant perturbations in the initialization. Simultaneously, the approach&#10;enables on&#45;par visual&#45;inertial odometry performance in refractive media without&#10;prior knowledge of the refractive index or requirement of medium&#45;specific&#10;camera calibration.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12074v1) |&#10;| Influence of dislocations in multilayer graphene stacks: A phase field&#10; &#160;crystal study | K. R. Elder, Zhi&#45;Feng Huang, T. Ala&#45;Nissila | &#160;&#160;In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene&#10;stacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a&#10;recently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems&#10;incorporating out&#45;of&#45;plane deformations and parameterized to match to density&#10;functional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems. The&#10;specific configuration considered consists of one monolayer containing four&#10;$5|7$ dislocations (i.e., two dislocation dipoles) sandwiched in between&#10;perfect graphene layers. The study reveals how the strain field from the&#10;dislocations in the defected layer leads to out&#45;of&#45;plane deformations that in&#10;turn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are&#10;made for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a&#10;defect&#45;free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and&#10;system size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by&#10;roughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence&#10;across the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height&#10;profiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12073v1) |&#10;| PAD&#45;FT: A Lightweight Defense for Backdoor Attacks via Data Purification&#10; &#160;and Fine&#45;Tuning | Yukai Xu, Yujie Gu, Kouichi Sakurai | &#160;&#160;Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks,&#10;particularly as recent advancements have led to increasingly subtle&#10;implantation, making the defense more challenging. Existing defense mechanisms&#10;typically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and&#10;involve retraining an auxiliary model or fine&#45;tuning the entire victim model.&#10;However, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always&#10;feasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and&#10;lightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD&#45;FT, that does not require an&#10;additional clean dataset and fine&#45;tunes only a very small part of the model to&#10;disinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a&#10;simple data purification process to identify and select the most&#45;likely clean&#10;data from the poisoned training dataset. The self&#45;purified clean dataset is&#10;then used for activation clipping and fine&#45;tuning only the last classification&#10;layer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation&#10;clipping, and classifier fine&#45;tuning, our mechanism PAD&#45;FT demonstrates&#10;superior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as&#10;confirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12072v1) |&#10;| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing&#10; &#160;data in Irish sagas | P. MacCarron | &#160;&#160;For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts&#10;in order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify&#10;similarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the&#10;significance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture&#10;requires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and&#10;often impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the&#10;network of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that&#10;the top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent&#10;with central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has&#10;been lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust&#10;to a large random removal of edges.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12071v1) |&#10;| The repetition threshold for ternary rich words | James D. Currie, Lucas Mol, Jarkko Peltomäki | &#160;&#160;In 2014, Vesti proposed the problem of determining the repetition threshold&#10;for infinite rich words, i.e., for infinite words in which all factors of&#10;length $n$ contain $n$ distinct nonempty palindromic factors. In 2020, Currie,&#10;Mol, and Rampersad proved a conjecture of Baranwal and Shallit that the&#10;repetition threshold for binary rich words is $2 + sqrt{2}/2$. In this paper,&#10;we prove a structure theorem for $16/7$&#45;power&#45;free ternary rich words. Using&#10;the structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich&#10;words is $1 + 1/(3 &#45; mu) approx 2.25876324$, where $mu$ is the unique real&#10;root of the polynomial $x^3 &#45; 2x^2 &#45; 1$.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12068v1) |&#10;| Fitting Multilevel Factor Models | Tetiana Parshakova, Trevor Hastie, Stephen Boyd | &#160;&#160;We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance&#10;given by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~cite{parshakova2023factor}. We&#10;develop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation&#45;maximization (EM)&#10;algorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of&#10;the observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and&#10;maintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved&#10;through a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive&#10;definite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of an invertible PSD MLR matrix&#10;is also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the&#10;recursive Sherman&#45;Morrison&#45;Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of&#10;the inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky&#10;factorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities,&#10;yielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement.

Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by&#10;tidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to&#10;their proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the&#10;TRAPPIST&#45;1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In&#10;this work, we present the recent implementation of the co&#45;planar tidal torque&#10;and forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N&#45;body code&#10;Posidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using&#10;a tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of&#10;each planet by taking into account their multi&#45;layer internal structure&#10;computed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST&#45;1 planets&#10;are not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state.&#10;Planet&#45;planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and&#10;tides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a&#10;result, the sub&#45;stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and&#10;long&#45;timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with&#10;periods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12065v1) |&#10;| Quantum Magic and Multi&#45;Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei | Florian Brökemeier, S. Momme Hengstenberg, James W. T. Keeble, Caroline E. P. Robin, Federico Rocco, Martin J. Savage | &#160;&#160;Motivated by the Gottesman&#45;Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the&#10;quantum complexity of $p$&#45;shell and $sd$&#45;shell nuclei. Valence&#45;space nuclear&#10;shell&#45;model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit&#10;registers using the Jordan&#45;Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$&#45;shell and 24&#10;qubits for the $sd$&#45;shell), from which measures of the many&#45;body entanglement&#10;($n$&#45;tangles) and magic (non&#45;stabilizerness) are determined. While exact&#10;evaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of&#10;active nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex&#10;nuclei. The broadly&#45;applicable Pauli&#45;String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe&#45;) MCMC technique&#10;is introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed&#10;nuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $sim 8$ for some&#10;nuclei. Significant multi&#45;nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$&#45;shell,&#10;dominated by proton&#45;neutron configurations, along with significant measures of&#10;magic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on&#10;the path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion.&#10;These results indicate that quantum&#45;computing resources will accelerate&#10;precision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12064v1) |&#10;| Post&#45;Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a&#10; &#160;massive, rotating object | Lorenzo Iorio | &#160;&#160;The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the&#10;general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense&#45;Thirring&#10;components of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are&#10;analytically worked out to the first post&#45;Newtonian level. To the Newtonian&#10;order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as&#10;well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation&#10;in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the&#10;primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first&#10;to &#39;Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system&#10;along an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred&#10;close to the Sun&#39;s flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due&#10;to the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of&#10;microarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for&#10;the post&#45;Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)&#10;spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of&#10;the latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current&#10;(formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would&#10;bring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the&#10;predicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not&#10;changed by any of the post&#45;&#45;Keplerian accelerations considered. The&#10;calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any&#10;alternative models of gravity as well.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12063v1) |&#10;| Generalized Robot Learning Framework | Jiahuan Yan, Zhouyang Hong, Yu Zhao, Yu Tian, Yunxin Liu, Travis Davies, Luhui Hu | &#160;&#160;Imitation based robot learning has recently gained significant attention in&#10;the robotics field due to its theoretical potential for transferability and&#10;generalizability. However, it remains notoriously costly, both in terms of&#10;hardware and data collection, and deploying it in real&#45;world environments&#10;demands meticulous setup of robots and precise experimental conditions. In this&#10;paper, we present a low&#45;cost robot learning framework that is both easily&#10;reproducible and transferable to various robots and environments. We&#10;demonstrate that deployable imitation learning can be successfully applied even&#10;to industrial&#45;grade robots, not just expensive collaborative robotic arms.&#10;Furthermore, our results show that multi&#45;task robot learning is achievable with&#10;simple network architectures and fewer demonstrations than previously thought&#10;necessary. As the current evaluating method is almost subjective when it comes&#10;to real&#45;world manipulation tasks, we propose Voting Positive Rate (VPR) &#45; a&#10;novel evaluation strategy that provides a more objective assessment of&#10;performance. We conduct an extensive comparison of success rates across various&#10;self&#45;designed tasks to validate our approach. To foster collaboration and&#10;support the robot learning community, we have open&#45;sourced all relevant&#10;datasets and model checkpoints, available at huggingface.co/ZhiChengAI.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12061v1) |&#10;| PARAPHRASUS : A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Paraphrase&#10; &#160;Detection Models | Andrianos Michail, Simon Clematide, Juri Opitz | &#160;&#160;The task of determining whether two texts are paraphrases has long been a&#10;challenge in NLP. However, the prevailing notion of paraphrase is often quite&#10;simplistic, offering only a limited view of the vast spectrum of paraphrase&#10;phenomena. Indeed, we find that evaluating models in a paraphrase dataset can&#10;leave uncertainty about their true semantic understanding. To alleviate this,&#10;we release paraphrasus, a benchmark designed for multi&#45;dimensional assessment&#10;of paraphrase detection models and finer model selection. We find that&#10;paraphrase detection models under a fine&#45;grained evaluation lens exhibit&#10;trade&#45;offs that cannot be captured through a single classification dataset.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12060v1) |&#10;| Dual&#45;Layer Training and Decoding of Large Language Model with&#10; &#160;Simultaneously Thinking and Speaking | Ningyuan Xi, Xiaoyu Wang, Yetao Wu, Teng Chen, Qingqing Gu, Jinxian Qu, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong Chen, Luo Ji | &#160;&#160;Large Language Model can reasonably understand and generate human expressions&#10;but may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have&#10;been several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but&#10;most of them are not data&#45;driven or training&#45;based. In this paper, we are&#10;motivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel&#10;model architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts&#10;and then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines&#10;to annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt&#45;response samples, then&#10;add language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We&#10;train the language model by the thoughts&#45;augmented data and successfully let&#10;the thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally&#10;output more reasonable responses. Both qualitative examples and quantitative&#10;results validate the effectiveness and performance of TaS.

Using this&#10;framework and through experiments, explanations on the response of a neural&#10;network are given by pointing out the output classes that are easily reachable&#10;from a given input. This emphasizes how the proposed mathematical relationship&#10;between the output of the network and the geometry of its inputs can be&#10;exploited as an explainable artificial intelligence tool.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12057v1) |&#10;| Artemis: Efficient Commit&#45;and&#45;Prove SNARKs for zkML | Hidde Lycklama, Alexander Viand, Nikolay Avramov, Nicolas Küchler, Anwar Hithnawi | &#160;&#160;The widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) in various critical&#10;applications, from healthcare to autonomous systems, has raised significant&#10;concerns about privacy, accountability, and trustworthiness. To address these&#10;concerns, recent research has focused on developing zero&#45;knowledge machine&#10;learning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of&#10;ML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have&#10;substantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily&#10;optimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the&#10;substantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the&#10;model and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new&#10;Commit&#45;and&#45;Prove SNARK (CP&#45;SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that&#10;effectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML&#10;pipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white&#45;box use of the&#10;underlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic&#10;polynomial commitment and only makes black&#45;box use of the proof system. As a&#10;result, Artemis is compatible with state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art proof systems without&#10;trusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP&#45;SNARKs, evaluate&#10;their performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial&#10;improvements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover&#10;costs and maintaining efficiency even for large&#45;scale models. For example, for&#10;the VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from&#10;11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML&#10;towards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and&#10;complex ML models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12055v1) |&#10;| MMP for Enriques pairs and singular Enriques varieties | Francesco Antonio Denisi, Ángel David Ríos Ortiz, Nikolaos Tsakanikas, Zhixin Xie | &#160;&#160;We introduce and study the class of primitive Enriques varieties, whose&#10;smooth members are Enriques manifolds. We provide several examples and we&#10;demonstrate that this class is stable under the operations of the Minimal Model&#10;Program (MMP). In particular, given an Enriques manifold $Y$ and an effective&#10;$mathbb{R}$&#45;divisor $B_Y$ on $Y$ such that the pair $(Y,B_Y)$ is log&#10;canonical, we prove that any $(K_Y+B_Y)$&#45;MMP terminates with a minimal model&#10;$(Y&#39;,B_{Y&#39;})$ of $(Y,B_Y)$, where $Y&#39;$ is a $mathbb{Q}$&#45;factorial primitive&#10;Enriques variety with canonical singularities. Finally, we investigate the&#10;asymptotic theory of Enriques manifolds.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12054v1) |&#10;| Numerical renormalization group calculations for magnetic impurity&#10; &#160;systems with spin&#45;orbit coupling and crystal&#45;field effects | Aitor Calvo&#45;Fernández, María Blanco&#45;Rey, Asier Eiguren | &#160;&#160;Exploiting symmetries in the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method&#10;significantly enhances performance by improving accuracy, increasing&#10;computational speed, and optimizing memory efficiency. Published codes focus on&#10;continuous rotations and unitary groups, which generally are not applicable to&#10;systems with strong crystal&#45;field effects. The PointGroupNRG code implements&#10;symmetries related to discrete rotation groups, which are defined by the user&#10;in terms of Clebsch&#45;Gordan coefficients, together with particle conservation&#10;and spin rotation symmetries. In this paper we present a new version of the&#10;code that extends the available finite groups, previously limited to simply&#10;reducible point groups, in a way that all point and double groups become&#10;accessible. It also includes the full spin&#45;orbital rotation group. Moreover, to&#10;improve the code&#39;s flexibility for impurities with complex interactions, this&#10;new version allows to choose between a standard Anderson Hamiltonian for the&#10;impurity or, as another novel feature, an ionic model that requires only the&#10;spectrum and the impurity Lehmann amplitudes.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12050v1) |&#10;| Quantum&#45;like nonlinear interferometry with frequency&#45;engineered&#10; &#160;classical light | Romain Dalidet, Anthony Martin, Grégory Sauder, Laurent Labonté, Sébastien Tanzilli | &#160;&#160;Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic&#10;entanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits. Nonlinear&#10;optics has served as a workhorse for the generation of entangled photon pairs,&#10;ensuring both energy and phase conservation, but at the cost of limited rate&#10;and degraded signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio compared to laser&#45;based interferometry&#10;approaches. We present a &quot;quantum&#45;like&quot; nonlinear optical method that reaches&#10;super&#45;resolution in single&#45;photon detection regime. This is achieved by&#10;replacing photon&#45;pairs by coherent states of light, mimicking quantum&#10;properties through classical nonlinear optics processes. Our scheme utilizes&#10;two high&#45;brightness lasers. This results in a substantially greater&#10;signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio compared to its quantum counterpart. Such an approach&#10;paves the way to significantly reduced acquisition times, providing a pathway&#10;to explore signals across a broader range of bandwidth. The need to increase&#10;the frequency bandwidth of the quantum sensor significantly motivates the&#10;potential applications of this pathway.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12049v1) |&#10;| A Survey&#45;Based Quantitative Analysis of Stress Factors and Their Impacts&#10; &#160;Among Cybersecurity Professionals | Sunil Arora, John D. Hastings | &#160;&#160;This study investigates the prevalence and underlying causes of work&#45;related&#10;stress and burnout among cybersecurity professionals using a quantitative&#10;survey approach guided by the Job Demands&#45;Resources model. Analysis of&#10;responses from 50 cybersecurity practitioners reveals an alarming reality: 44%&#10;report experiencing severe work&#45;related stress and burnout, while an additional&#10;28% are uncertain about their condition. The demanding nature of cybersecurity&#10;roles, unrealistic expectations, and unsupportive organizational cultures&#10;emerge as primary factors fueling this crisis. Notably, 66% of respondents&#10;perceive cybersecurity jobs as more stressful than other IT positions, with 84%&#10;facing additional challenges due to the pandemic and recent high&#45;profile&#10;breaches. The study finds that most cybersecurity experts are reluctant to&#10;report their struggles to management, perpetuating a cycle of silence and&#10;neglect. To address this critical issue, the paper recommends that&#10;organizations foster supportive work environments, implement mindfulness&#10;programs, and address systemic challenges. By prioritizing the mental health of&#10;cybersecurity professionals, organizations can cultivate a more resilient and&#10;effective workforce to protect against an ever&#45;evolving threat landscape.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12047v1) |&#10;| Using Large Language Models to Generate Clinical Trial Tables and&#10; &#160;Figures | Yumeng Yang, Peter Krusche, Kristyn Pantoja, Cheng Shi, Ethan Ludmir, Kirk Roberts, Gen Zhu | &#160;&#160;Tables, figures, and listings (TFLs) are essential tools for summarizing&#10;clinical trial data. Creation of TFLs for reporting activities is often a&#10;time&#45;consuming task encountered routinely during the execution of clinical&#10;trials. This study explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate&#10;the generation of TFLs through prompt engineering and few&#45;shot transfer&#10;learning. Using public clinical trial data in ADaM format, our results&#10;demonstrated that LLMs can efficiently generate TFLs with prompt instructions,&#10;showcasing their potential in this domain. Furthermore, we developed a&#10;conservational agent named Clinical Trial TFL Generation Agent: An app that&#10;matches user queries to predefined prompts that produce customized programs to&#10;generate specific predefined TFLs.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12046v2) |&#10;| Handling Long&#45;Term Safety and Uncertainty in Safe Reinforcement Learning | Jonas Günster, Puze Liu, Jan Peters, Davide Tateo | &#160;&#160;Safety is one of the key issues preventing the deployment of reinforcement&#10;learning techniques in real&#45;world robots. While most approaches in the Safe&#10;Reinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and&#10;robot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them&#10;in complex real&#45;world settings. Instead, model&#45;based approaches that&#10;incorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning&#10;framework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on&#10;the real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot&#10;dynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task&#45;specific and hard&#10;to obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to&#10;compute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long&#45;term safety&#10;requirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe&#10;exploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus&#10;on ensuring long&#45;term safety and handling of uncertainty. Our approach is&#10;competitive or superior to state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methods in final performance while&#10;maintaining safer behavior during training.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12045v1) |&#10;| Quasiperiodic Floquet&#45;Gibbs states in Rydberg atomic systems | Wilson S. Martins, Federico Carollo, Kay Brandner, Igor Lesanovsky | &#160;&#160;Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by&#10;fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an&#10;equilibrium&#45;like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet&#45;Magnus&#10;Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi&#39;s golden rule, we show&#10;that such Floquet&#45;Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated&#10;Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab&#45;frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function&#10;of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the&#10;system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which&#10;is necessary to uphold high&#45;lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To&#10;corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five&#10;interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate&#10;numerically that the second&#45;order Floquet&#45;Gibbs state of this system is&#10;essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding&#10;Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently&#10;large.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12044v1) |&#10;| Understanding the Effects of the Baidu&#45;ULTR Logging Policy on Two&#45;Tower&#10; &#160;Models | Morris de Haan, Philipp Hager | &#160;&#160;Despite the popularity of the two&#45;tower model for unbiased learning to rank&#10;(ULTR) tasks, recent work suggests that it suffers from a major limitation that&#10;could lead to its collapse in industry applications: the problem of logging&#10;policy confounding. Several potential solutions have even been proposed;&#10;however, the evaluation of these methods was mostly conducted using&#10;semi&#45;synthetic simulation experiments. This paper bridges the gap between&#10;theory and practice by investigating the confounding problem on the largest&#10;real&#45;world dataset, Baidu&#45;ULTR. Our main contributions are threefold: 1) we&#10;show that the conditions for the confounding problem are given on Baidu&#45;ULTR,&#10;2) the confounding problem bears no significant effect on the two&#45;tower model,&#10;and 3) we point to a potential mismatch between expert annotations, the golden&#10;standard in ULTR, and user click behavior.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12043v1) |&#10;| ASR Benchmarking: Need for a More Representative Conversational Dataset | Gaurav Maheshwari, Dmitry Ivanov, Théo Johannet, Kevin El Haddad | &#160;&#160;Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable&#10;performance on widely used benchmarks such as LibriSpeech and Fleurs.

Our results show&#10;a significant performance drop across various state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art ASR models when&#10;tested in conversational settings. Furthermore, we observe a correlation&#10;between Word Error Rate and the presence of speech disfluencies, highlighting&#10;the critical need for more realistic, conversational ASR benchmarks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12042v1) |&#10;&#10;">

However, current methods often require hundreds to&#10;thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high&#45;dimensional visual&#10;observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual&#10;representations are predominantly either pretrained on out&#45;of&#45;domain data or&#10;trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present&#10;DynaMo, a new in&#45;domain, self&#45;supervised method for learning visual&#10;representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a&#10;latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of&#10;image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without&#10;augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.&#10;Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out&#45;of&#45;domain data such as Internet&#10;datasets or cross&#45;embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real&#10;environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly&#10;improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self&#45;supervised&#10;learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo&#10;hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,&#10;and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and&#10;measure its impact on downstream policy performance.

Qwen2&#45;VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,&#10;which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions&#10;into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to&#10;generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning&#10;with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary&#10;Position Embedding (M&#45;RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional&#10;information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for&#10;processing both images and videos, enhancing the model&#39;s visual perception&#10;capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2&#45;VL&#10;investigates the scaling laws for large vision&#45;language models (LVLMs). By&#10;scaling both the model size&#45;with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters&#45;and the&#10;amount of training data, the Qwen2&#45;VL Series achieves highly competitive&#10;performance.

BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses&#10;and 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance&#10;of deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to&#10;integrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and&#10;performance. However, widely&#45;used C++&#45;based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,&#10;g$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries&#10;like PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of&#10;debugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we&#10;introduce an eager&#45;mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,&#10;providing PyTorch&#45;compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach&#10;includes GPU&#45;accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for&#10;2nd&#45;order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear&#10;solvers. Our eager&#45;mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency,&#10;achieving an average speedup of 18.5$times$, 22$times$, and 23$times$&#10;compared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12190v1) |&#10;| Massively Multi&#45;Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context | Felix B Mueller, Julian Tanke, Juergen Gall | &#160;&#160;Forecasting long&#45;term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of&#10;human behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input&#10;sequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby&#10;people can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene&#45;aware social&#10;transformer model (SAST) to forecast long&#45;term (10s) human motion motion.&#10;Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely&#10;varying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal&#10;convolutional encoder&#45;decoder architecture with a Transformer&#45;based bottleneck&#10;that allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model&#10;the conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We&#10;benchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to&#10;16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously.

Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon | &#160;&#160;Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a&#10;perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from&#10;fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($mu$&#45;distortion) to late&#45;time&#10;baryonic feedback processes (y&#45;distortion). While the y&#45;distortion can be&#10;detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the&#10;$Lambda$CDM&#45;predicted $mu$&#45;distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude&#10;smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a&#10;serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $mu$&#10;arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the&#10;primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k approx 1&#45;10^{4}$ Mpc$^{&#45;1}$. Here,&#10;we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly&#10;detecting $mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but&#10;with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we&#10;optimize the instrument&#39;s configuration to target $mu$ while robustly&#10;marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike&#10;Fourier&#45;transform&#45;spectrometer&#45;based designs, the specific bands and their&#10;individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing&#10;significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the&#10;$Lambda$CDM&#45;predicted $mu$&#45;distortion at $approx 5sigma$ (10$sigma$)&#10;assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission&#10;duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized&#10;configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1&#45;2000 GHz with degree&#45;scale angular&#10;resolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally&#10;measure the y&#45;distortion at sub&#45;percent precision and its relativistic&#10;correction at percent&#45;level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total&#10;thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12188v1) |&#10;| Exoplanet accretion monitoring spectroscopic survey (ENTROPY) I.&#10; &#160;Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary&#45;mass&#10; &#160;object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C. Ringqvist, Dorian Demars, Markus Janson, Mickaël Bonnefoy, Yuhiko Aoyama, Gabriel&#45;Dominique Marleau, Catherine Dougados, Judit Szulágyi, Thanawuth Thanathibodee | &#160;&#160;Accretion among planets is a poorly understood phenomenon, due to lack of&#10;both observational and theoretical studies. Detection of emission lines from&#10;accreting gas giants facilitate detailed investigations into this process. This&#10;work presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known&#10;young, planetary&#45;mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf&#10;2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7&#45;21 Mj and age 5&#45;45 Myr, located at 45+&#45;2&#10;pc. We obtained the first high&#45;resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target&#10;with VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near&#45;UV to visible wavelengths (3200&#45;6800&#10;AA). We report resolved H3&#45;H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.&#10;Based on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+&#45;1&#10;km/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR&#10;excess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of&#10;the parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+&#45;63 K and radius to 1.5+&#45;0.1&#10;Rj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet&#45;surface shock model&#10;implies a pre&#45;shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,&#45;40) km/s and a pre&#45;shock&#10;density of log(n0/cm^&#45;3)=14(+0,&#45;5). Pre&#45;shock velocity points to a mass of&#10;6(+8,&#45;4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary&#10;Lline&#45;Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of&#10;1.4(+2.8,&#45;0.9)x10^&#45;8 Mj/yr.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12187v1) |&#10;| Qwen2.5&#45;Coder Technical Report | Binyuan Hui, Jian Yang, Zeyu Cui, Jiaxi Yang, Dayiheng Liu, Lei Zhang, Tianyu Liu, Jiajun Zhang, Bowen Yu, Kai Dang, An Yang, Rui Men, Fei Huang, Xingzhang Ren, Xuancheng Ren, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin | &#160;&#160;In this report, we introduce the Qwen2.5&#45;Coder series, a significant upgrade&#10;from its predecessor, CodeQwen1.5. This series includes two models:&#10;Qwen2.5&#45;Coder&#45;1.5B and Qwen2.5&#45;Coder&#45;7B. As a code&#45;specific model,&#10;Qwen2.5&#45;Coder is built upon the Qwen2.5 architecture and continues pretrained&#10;on a vast corpus of over 5.5 trillion tokens. Through meticulous data cleaning,&#10;scalable synthetic data generation, and balanced data mixing, Qwen2.5&#45;Coder&#10;demonstrates impressive code generation capabilities while retaining general&#10;versatility. The model has been evaluated on a wide range of code&#45;related&#10;tasks, achieving state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art (SOTA) performance across more than 10&#10;benchmarks, including code generation, completion, reasoning, and repair,&#10;consistently outperforming larger models of the same model size. We believe&#10;that the release of the Qwen2.5&#45;Coder series will not only push the boundaries&#10;of research in code intelligence but also, through its permissive licensing,&#10;encourage broader adoption by developers in real&#45;world applications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12186v1) |&#10;| Disruption of a massive molecular cloud by a supernova in the Galactic&#10; &#160;Centre: Initial results from the ACES project | M.

Xu | &#160;&#160;The Milky Way&#39;s Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our&#10;local solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions&#10;it exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong&#10;dynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).&#10;Consequently, it is likely that there are large&#45;scale physical structures&#10;within the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we&#10;present new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array&#10;(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a&#10;multi&#45;wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the&#10;M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring&#45;like morphology. We&#10;estimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring to be 79&quot;&#10;and 154&quot;, respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre&#10;distance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $&gt; 10^{4}$ cm$^{&#45;3}$, a&#10;mass of $sim$ $10^6$ M$_odot$, and an expansion speed of $sim$ 20 km&#10;s$^{&#45;1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($&gt; 10^{51}$ erg) and&#10;momentum ($&gt; 10^7$ M$_odot$ km s$^{&#45;1}$). We discuss several possible causes&#10;for the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback&#10;and large&#45;scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the&#10;M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring is a single high&#45;energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain&#10;the observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have&#10;taken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which&#10;we now see as the M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an&#10;extreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12185v1) |&#10;| To CoT or not to CoT? Chain&#45;of&#45;thought helps mainly on math and symbolic&#10; &#160;reasoning | Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett | &#160;&#160;Chain&#45;of&#45;thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting&#10;reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of&#10;tasks is this extra ``thinking&#39;&#39; really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted&#10;a quantitative meta&#45;analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own&#10;evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives&#10;strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with&#10;much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the&#10;answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the&#10;question or model&#39;s response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic&#10;operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of&#10;CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing&#10;against tool&#45;augmented LLMs. Much of CoT&#39;s gain comes from improving symbolic&#10;execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our&#10;results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance&#10;while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond&#10;prompt&#45;based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation&#10;across the whole range of LLM applications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183v1) |&#10;| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs | Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T. Chiu, Siyu Ren, Fei Yuan, Wenting Zhao, Zhiyong Wu, Alexander M. Rush | &#160;&#160;Broad textual understanding and in&#45;context learning require language models&#10;that utilize full document contexts. Due to the implementation challenges&#10;associated with directly training long&#45;context models, many methods have been&#10;proposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to&#10;differences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these&#10;approaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long&#45;context&#10;performance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a&#10;controlled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation,&#10;utilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several&#10;insights into long&#45;context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of&#10;perplexity as a general&#45;purpose performance indicator even in longer&#45;context&#10;tasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods&#10;systematically underperform across long&#45;context tasks. Finally, we confirm that&#10;exact fine&#45;tuning based methods are generally effective within the range of&#10;their extension, whereas extrapolation remains challenging. All codebases,&#10;models, and checkpoints will be made available open&#45;source, promoting&#10;transparency and facilitating further research in this critical area of AI&#10;development.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12181v1) |&#10;| Finetuning Language Models to Emit Linguistic Expressions of Uncertainty | Arslan Chaudhry, Sridhar Thiagarajan, Dilan Gorur | &#160;&#160;Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in information&#45;seeking&#10;and decision&#45;making tasks. Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate&#10;information that conflicts with real&#45;world facts, and their persuasive style&#10;can make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result,&#10;end&#45;users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with&#10;the accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all&#10;outputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore&#10;supervised finetuning on uncertainty&#45;augmented predictions as a method to&#10;develop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty.&#10;Specifically, we measure the calibration of pre&#45;trained models and then&#10;fine&#45;tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of&#10;uncertainty. Through experiments on various question&#45;answering datasets, we&#10;demonstrate that LLMs are well&#45;calibrated in assessing their predictions, and&#10;supervised finetuning based on the model&#39;s own confidence leads to&#10;well&#45;calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single&#45;claim&#10;answers.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12180v1) |&#10;| Computational Dynamical Systems | Jordan Cotler, Semon Rezchikov | &#160;&#160;We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite&#45;dimensional&#10;dynamical systems. Building off of previous work, we give definitions for what&#10;it means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine. We then&#10;show that &#39;chaotic&#39; dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and&#10;&#39;integrable&#39; dynamical systems (more generally, measure&#45;preserving systems)&#10;cannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines can&#10;be robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, we&#10;show that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable&#10;one&#45;dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and&#10;moreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt.&#10;More broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one &#39;machine&#39; to simulate&#10;another, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low&#45;complexity &#39;encoders&#39; and&#10;&#39;decoders&#39; to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system&#10;being simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical&#10;system leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity&#10;theory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12179v1) |&#10;| Poisson approximate likelihood compared to the particle filter | Yize Hao, Aaron A. Abkemeier, Edward L. Ionides | &#160;&#160;Filtering algorithms are fundamental for inference on partially observed&#10;stochastic dynamic systems, since they provide access to the likelihood&#10;function and hence enable likelihood&#45;based or Bayesian inference. A novel&#10;Poisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.&#10;(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering&#10;a fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of&#10;partially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL&#10;is the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large&#10;improvement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,&#10;based on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.&#10;(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should&#10;use PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence&#10;also reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a&#10;shortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that&#10;the comparison of log&#45;likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al. (2023) is&#10;flawed because their PAL calculations were carried out using a dataset scaled&#10;differently from the previous study. If PAL and the particle filter are applied&#10;to the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears. On simulations&#10;where the model is correctly specified, the particle filter outperforms PAL.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12173v1) |&#10;| You Only Read Once (YORO): Learning to Internalize Database Knowledge&#10; &#160;for Text&#45;to&#45;SQL | Hideo Kobayashi, Wuwei Lan, Peng Shi, Shuaichen Chang, Jiang Guo, Henghui Zhu, Zhiguo Wang, Patrick Ng | &#160;&#160;While significant progress has been made on the text&#45;to&#45;SQL task, recent&#10;solutions repeatedly encode the same database schema for every question,&#10;resulting in unnecessary high inference cost and often overlooking crucial&#10;database knowledge. To address these issues, we propose You Only Read Once&#10;(YORO), a novel paradigm that directly internalizes database knowledge into the&#10;parametric knowledge of a text&#45;to&#45;SQL model during training and eliminates the&#10;need for schema encoding during inference. YORO significantly reduces the input&#10;token length by 66%&#45;98%. Despite its shorter inputs, our empirical results&#10;demonstrate YORO&#39;s competitive performances with traditional systems on three&#10;benchmarks as well as its significant outperformance on large databases.&#10;Furthermore, YORO excels in handling questions with challenging value&#10;retrievals such as abbreviation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12172v1) |&#10;| Ergodic properties of infinite extension of symmetric interval exchange&#10; &#160;transformations | Przemysław Berk, Frank Trujillo, Hao Wu | &#160;&#160;We prove that skew products with the cocycle given by the function&#10;$f(x)=a(x&#45;1/2)$ with $a&#10;eq 0$ are ergodic for every ergodic symmetric IET in&#10;the base, thus giving the full characterization of ergodic extensions in this&#10;family. Moreover, we prove that under an additional natural assumption of&#10;unique ergodicity on the IET, we can replace $f$ with any differentiable&#10;function with a non&#45;zero sum of jumps. Finally, by considering weakly mixing&#10;IETs instead of just ergodic, we show that the skew products with cocycle given&#10;by $f$ have infinite ergodic index.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12168v1) |&#10;| multiPI&#45;TransBTS: A Multi&#45;Path Learning Framework for Brain Tumor Image&#10; &#160;Segmentation Based on Multi&#45;Physical Information | Hongjun Zhu, Jiaohang Huang, Kuo Chen, Xuehui Ying, Ying Qian | &#160;&#160;Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis,&#10;treatment planning, and monitoring the progression of brain tumors. However,&#10;due to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across&#10;different MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In&#10;this study, we propose a novel Transformer&#45;based framework, multiPI&#45;TransBTS,&#10;which integrates multi&#45;physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.&#10;The model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi&#45;modal&#10;imaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor&#10;characteristics. The multiPI&#45;TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an&#10;Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi&#45;source, multi&#45;scale feature&#10;decoder. The encoder incorporates a multi&#45;branch architecture to separately&#10;extract modality&#45;specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module&#10;fuses information from multiple sources using channel&#45;wise and element&#45;wise&#10;attention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both&#10;common and task&#45;specific features through a Task&#45;Specific Feature Introduction&#10;(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),&#10;Tumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on&#10;the BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of&#10;multiPI&#45;TransBTS over the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methods. The model consistently&#10;achieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,&#10;highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results&#10;also indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision&#10;and recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a&#10;significant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving&#10;clinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12167v1) |&#10;| Synchrotron self&#45;Compton in a radiative&#45;adiabatic fireball scenario:&#10; &#160;Modelling the multiwavelength observations in some Fermi/LAT bursts | Nissim Fraija, P. Veres, B. Betancourt Kamenetskaia, A. Galvan&#45;Gamez, M. G. Dainotti, Simone Dichiara, R. L. Becerra | &#160;&#160;Energetic GeV photons expected from the closest and the most energetic&#10;Gamma&#45;ray bursts (GRBs) provide an unique opportunity to study the&#10;very&#45;high&#45;energy emission as well as the possible correlations with lower&#10;energy bands in realistic GRB afterglow models. In the standard GRB afterglow&#10;model, the relativistic homogeneous shock is usually considered to be fully&#10;adiabatic, however, it could be partially radiative. Based on the external&#10;forward&#45;shock scenario in both stellar wind and constant&#45;density medium. We&#10;present a radiative&#45;adiabatic analytical model of the synchrotron self&#45;Compton&#10;(SSC) and synchrotron processes considering an electron energy distribution&#10;with a power&#45;law index of 1 &lt; p &lt; 2 and 2 $&#10;eq$ p. We show that the SSC&#10;scenario plays a relevant role in the radiative parameter $epsilon$, leading&#10;to a prolonged evolution during the slow cooling regime. In a particular case,&#10;we derive the Fermi/LAT light curves together with the photons with energies&#10;$geq$ 100 MeV in a sample of nine bursts from the second Fermi/LAT GRB catalog&#10;that exhibited temporal and spectral indices with $geq$ 1.5 and $approx$ 2,&#10;respectively. These events can hardly be described with closure relations of&#10;the standard synchrotron afterglow model, and also exhibit energetic photons&#10;above the synchrotron limit. We have modeled the multi&#45;wavelength observations&#10;of our sample to constrain the microphysical parameters, the circumburst&#10;density, the bulk Lorentz factor and the mechanism responsible for explaining&#10;the energetic GeV photons.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12166v1) |&#10;| Blind Deconvolution on Graphs: Exact and Stable Recovery | Chang Ye, Gonzalo Mateos | &#160;&#160;We study a blind deconvolution problem on graphs, which arises in the context&#10;of localizing a few sources that diffuse over networks. While the observations&#10;are bilinear functions of the unknown graph filter coefficients and sparse&#10;input signals, a mild requirement on invertibility of the diffusion filter&#10;enables an efficient convex relaxation leading to a linear programming&#10;formulation that can be tackled with off&#45;the&#45;shelf solvers. Under the&#10;Bernoulli&#45;Gaussian model for the inputs, we derive sufficient exact recovery&#10;conditions in the noise&#45;free setting. A stable recovery result is then&#10;established, ensuring the estimation error remains manageable even when the&#10;observations are corrupted by a small amount of noise. Numerical tests with&#10;synthetic and real&#45;world network data illustrate the merits of the proposed&#10;algorithm, its robustness to noise as well as the benefits of leveraging&#10;multiple signals to aid the (blind) localization of sources of diffusion. At a&#10;fundamental level, the results presented here broaden the scope of classical&#10;blind deconvolution of (spatio&#45;)temporal signals to irregular graph domains.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12164v1) |&#10;| Generalized compression and compressive search of large datasets | Morgan E. Prior, Thomas Howard III, Emily Light, Najib Ishaq, Noah M. Daniels | &#160;&#160;The Big Data explosion has necessitated the development of search algorithms&#10;that scale sub&#45;linearly in time and memory.&#10; &#160;While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently,&#10;few algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain&#45;specific.&#10; &#160;We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to&#10;perform $k$&#45;NN and $&#13;ho$&#45;NN search on compressed data while only decompressing&#10;a small, relevant, portion of the data.&#10; &#160;panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low&#45;dimensional&#10;structure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.&#10; &#160;panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between&#10;two points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in&#10;terms of the other.&#10; &#160;This property holds for many widely&#45;used distance functions, e.g. string edit&#10;distances (Levenshtein, Needleman&#45;Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures&#10;(Jaccard, Dice, etc.).&#10; &#160;We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic,&#10;and set data.&#10; &#160;We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the&#10;compressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.&#10; &#160;panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering&#10;sub&#45;linear time performance for $k$&#45;NN and $&#13;ho$&#45;NN search.&#10; &#160;We conclude that panCAKES is an efficient, general&#45;purpose algorithm for&#10;exact compressive search on large datasets that obey the manifold hypothesis.&#10; &#160;We provide an open&#45;source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming&#10;language.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12161v1) |&#10;| WeHelp: A Shared Autonomy System for Wheelchair Users | Abulikemu Abuduweili, Alice Wu, Tianhao Wei, Weiye Zhao | &#160;&#160;There is a large population of wheelchair users. Most of the wheelchair users&#10;need help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs&#10;are not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this&#10;project, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair&#10;users. A robot with a WeHelp system has three modes, following mode, remote&#10;control mode and tele&#45;operation mode. In the following mode, the robot follows&#10;the wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can&#10;ask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the&#10;wheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech&#10;recognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode.&#10;In the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy&#10;stick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs,&#10;such as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high&#10;shelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant&#10;takes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks&#10;for their needs. Our evaluation shows that the pipeline is useful and practical&#10;for wheelchair users.

These IFSs&#10;exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are&#10;topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the&#10;Blonder&#45;Tinkham&#45;Klapwijk formalism and considering normal&#45;$d$&#45;wave&#10;superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients&#10;including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and&#10;examine the validation of Widemann&#45;Franz law in the presence of both voltage&#10;and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of&#10;$d$&#45;wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the&#10;normal&#45;superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric&#10;response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in&#10;Seebeck coefficient ($sim 200,mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($sim 3.5$) due to the&#10;generation of the IFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for&#10;device applications.

Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker&#10;identity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these&#10;challenges, we propose a NeRF&#45;based network. Since we train our network on&#10;monocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn&#10;disentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio&#10;features in a self&#45;supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects.&#10;By incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned&#10;audio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle&#10;motion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer&#45;based architecture&#10;that learns expression features, capturing long&#45;range facial expressions and&#10;disentangling them from the speech&#45;specific mouth movements. Through&#10;quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can&#10;synthesize high&#45;fidelity talking face videos, achieving state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art facial&#10;expression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12156v1) |&#10;| Autopet III challenge: Incorporating anatomical knowledge into nnUNet&#10; &#160;for lesion segmentation in PET/CT | Hamza Kalisch, Fabian Hörst, Ken Herrmann, Jens Kleesiek, Constantin Seibold | &#160;&#160;Lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging is essential for precise tumor&#10;characterization, which supports personalized treatment planning and enhances&#10;diagnostic precision in oncology. However, accurate manual segmentation of&#10;lesions is time&#45;consuming and prone to inter&#45;observer variability. Given the&#10;rising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods,&#10;particularly deep&#45;learning&#45;based approaches, have become increasingly more&#10;relevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation&#10;of tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting,&#10;addressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable&#10;solutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET&#10;challenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers&#10;(FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers. To this extent, we developed a&#10;classifier that identifies the tracer of the given PET/CT based on the Maximum&#10;Intensity Projection of the PET scan. We trained two individual&#10;nnUNet&#45;ensembles for each tracer where anatomical labels are included as a&#10;multi&#45;label task to enhance the model&#39;s performance. Our final submission&#10;achieves cross&#45;validation Dice scores of 76.90% and 61.33% for the publicly&#10;available FDG and PSMA datasets, respectively.

However, a&#10;robot&#39;s ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if&#10;naively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach&#45;avoid&#10;dynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a&#10;safety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human&#39;s behavior&#10;as goal&#45;driven but conditioned on the robot&#39;s plan, enabling us to capture&#10;influence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical&#10;and belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in&#10;human behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE&#10;(Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high&#45;dimensional&#10;(39&#45;D) simulated human&#45;robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline&#10;game&#45;theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust&#10;baseline that treats the human as a worst&#45;case adversary, a safety controller&#10;that does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy&#45;function&#45;based&#10;safety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage&#10;the influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing&#10;the robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate&#10;during task execution.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12153v1) |&#10;| Decoding Style: Efficient Fine&#45;Tuning of LLMs for Image&#45;Guided Outfit&#10; &#160;Recommendation with Preference | Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan | &#160;&#160;Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding&#10;both fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper&#10;presents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large&#10;language models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their &quot;black box&quot; and static&#10;nature through fine&#45;tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item&#10;visual&#45;textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a&#10;Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style&#10;and color characteristics from human&#45;curated fashion images, forming the basis&#10;for personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine&#45;tuned on the&#10;open&#45;source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability&#10;to recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative&#10;examples is employed to enhance the LLM&#39;s decision&#45;making process. This creates&#10;a self&#45;enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in&#10;line with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore&#10;dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill&#45;in&#45;the&#45;blank,&#10;and complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework&#39;s&#10;ability to generate stylish, trend&#45;aligned outfit suggestions, continuously&#10;improving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our&#10;proposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more&#10;cohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the&#10;proposed framework&#39;s potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate&#10;suggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit&#10;generation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12150v1) |&#10;| Mechanical Wannier&#45;Stark Ladder of Diamond Spin&#45;Mechanical Lamb Wave&#10; &#160;Resonators | Philip Andrango, Hailin Wang | &#160;&#160;We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier&#45;Stark ladders of&#10;diamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with&#10;ultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin&#10;properties. Three nearest&#45;neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric&#10;configurations and a large range of coupling rates have been explored for the&#10;realization of Wannier&#45;Stark ladders of LWRs, potentially enabling long&#45;range&#10;connectivity between spin qubits through their interactions with mechanical&#10;vibrations. Additional analysis on the effects of disorder indicates that the&#10;proposed Wannier&#45;Stark ladder can be robust against realistic experimental&#10;imperfections. The development of mechanical quantum networks of spin qubits&#10;with long&#45;range connectivity can open the door to the implementation of newly&#10;developed quantum low&#45;density parity&#45;check codes in solid&#45;state systems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12149v1) |&#10;| MAgICoRe: Multi&#45;Agent, Iterative, Coarse&#45;to&#45;Fine Refinement for&#10; &#160;Reasoning | Justin Chih&#45;Yao Chen, Archiki Prasad, Swarnadeep Saha, Elias Stengel&#45;Eskin, Mohit Bansal | &#160;&#160;Large Language Models&#39; (LLM) reasoning can be improved using test&#45;time&#10;aggregation strategies, i.e., generating multiple samples and voting among&#10;generated samples. While these improve performance, they often reach a&#10;saturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM&#45;generated&#10;feedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key&#10;challenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can&#10;over&#45;correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and&#10;address errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self&#45;correct and struggle to&#10;identify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding&#10;how many iterations of refinement are needed is non&#45;trivial, and stopping too&#10;soon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose&#10;MAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty&#10;as easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse&#45;grained aggregation and hard&#10;ones with fine&#45;grained and iterative multi&#45;agent refinement. To improve error&#10;localization, we incorporate external step&#45;wise reward model (RM) scores.&#10;Moreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi&#45;agent loop with&#10;three agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on&#10;step&#45;wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure&#10;sufficient refinement, we re&#45;evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating&#10;further rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama&#45;3&#45;8B and GPT&#45;3.5&#10;and show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of&#10;MAgICoRe beats Self&#45;Consistency by 3.4%, Best&#45;of&#45;k by 3.2%, and Self&#45;Refine by&#10;4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with&#10;baselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our&#10;ablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe&#39;s RMs and multi&#45;agent&#10;communication.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147v1) |&#10;| Lempel&#45;Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka | &#160;&#160;Lempel&#45;Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string&#10;processing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into&#10;blocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence&#10;of a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another&#10;occurrence earlier in $T$. Due to numerous applications, LZ77 factorization is&#10;one of the most studied problems on strings. In the 47 years since its&#10;inception, several algorithms were developed for different models of&#10;computation, including parallel, GPU, external&#45;memory, and quantum. Remarkably,&#10;however, the complexity of the most basic variant is still not settled: All&#10;existing algorithms in the RAM model run in $Omega(n)$ time, which is a&#10;$Theta(&#10;og n)$ factor away from the lower bound of $Omega(n/&#10;og n)$&#10;(following from the necessity to read the input, which takes $Theta(n/&#10;og n)$&#10;space for $Tin{0,1}^{n}$).&#10; &#160;We present the first $o(n)$&#45;time algorithm for LZ77 factorization, breaking&#10;the linear&#45;time barrier present for nearly 50 years. For $Tin{0,1}^{n}$, our&#10;algorithm runs in $mathcal{O}(n/sqrt{&#10;og n})=o(n)$ time and uses the optimal&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og n)$ working space. Our algorithm generalizes to&#10;$Sigma=[0..sigma)$, where $sigma=n^{mathcal{O}(1)}$. The runtime and&#10;working space then become $mathcal{O}((n&#10;ogsigma)/sqrt{&#10;og n})$ and&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og_{sigma} n)$. To obtain our algorithm, we prove a more&#10;general result: For any constant $epsilonin(0,1)$ and $Tin[0..sigma)^{n}$,&#10;in $mathcal{O}((n&#10;ogsigma)/sqrt{&#10;og n})$ time and using&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og_{sigma}n)$ space, we can construct an&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og_{sigma}n)$&#45;size index that, given any $P=T[j..j+ell)$&#10;(represented as $(j,ell)$), computes the leftmost occurrence of $P$ in $T$ in&#10;$mathcal{O}(&#10;og^{epsilon}n)$ time. In other words, we solve the&#10;indexing/online variant of the LZ77 problem.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12146v1) |&#10;| Experimental Evidence That Conversational Artificial Intelligence Can&#10; &#160;Steer Consumer Behavior Without Detection | Tobias Werner, Ivan Soraperra, Emilio Calvano, David C.

The long&#45;standing goal of&#10;creating a predictive global model for the binding energy of a nucleus remains&#10;a significant challenge, however, and prompts the need for precise measurements&#10;of atomic masses to serve as anchor points for model developments. We present&#10;precise mass measurements of neutron&#45;rich Ru and Pd isotopes performed at the&#10;Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade facility at Argonne National&#10;Laboratory using the Canadian Penning Trap mass spectrometer. The masses of&#10;$^{108}$Ru, $^{110}$Ru and $^{116}$Pd were measured to a relative mass&#10;precision $delta m/m approx 10^{&#45;8}$ via the phase&#45;imaging&#10;ion&#45;cyclotron&#45;resonance technique, and represent an improvement of&#10;approximately an order of magnitude over previous measurements.

By effectively prompting large language&#10;models (LLMs), we address spelling errors and rephrasing issues in motion&#10;retrieval. Our approach utilizes a multi&#45;part retrieval strategy to improve the&#10;generalizability of motion retrieval across the language space. We create&#10;diverse samples through the spatial composition of the retrieved motions.&#10;Furthermore, by utilizing low&#45;level, part&#45;specific motion information, we can&#10;construct motion samples for unseen text descriptions.

In this&#10;report, we introduce Takin AudioLLM, a series of techniques and models, mainly&#10;including Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, specifically designed for&#10;audiobook production. These models are capable of zero&#45;shot speech production,&#10;generating high&#45;quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human&#10;speech and facilitating individuals to customize the speech content according&#10;to their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec&#10;language model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a&#10;multi&#45;task training framework, capable of generating high&#45;fidelity natural&#10;speech in a zero&#45;shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and&#10;timbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while&#10;advocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its&#10;naturalness and expressiveness. Last, we propose the Takin Morphing system with&#10;highly decoupled and advanced timbre and prosody modeling approaches, which&#10;enables individuals to customize speech production with their preferred timbre&#10;and prosody in a precise and controllable manner.

However, sparse computation challenges&#10;traditional training practices, as discrete expert routing hinders standard&#10;backpropagation and thus gradient&#45;based optimization, which are the cornerstone&#10;of deep learning. To better pursue the scaling power of MoE, we introduce GRIN&#10;(GRadient&#45;INformed MoE training), which incorporates sparse gradient estimation&#10;for expert routing and configures model parallelism to avoid token dropping.&#10;Applying GRIN to autoregressive language modeling, we develop a top&#45;2&#10;16$times$3.8B MoE model.

However, each approach has its own limitations,&#10;making it less effective to rely solely on either one. An emerging and&#10;promising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractive&#10;summarization methods. Despite the plethora of studies in this domain, research&#10;on the combined methodology remains scarce, particularly in the context of&#10;Vietnamese language processing. This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDS&#10;framework leveraging a two&#45;component pipeline architecture that integrates&#10;extractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs an&#10;extractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This is&#10;achieved by a modification of the pre&#45;trained BERT network, which derives&#10;semantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet network&#10;structures. The second component utilizes the VBD&#45;LLaMA2&#45;7B&#45;50b model for&#10;abstractive summarization, ultimately generating the final summary document.&#10;Our proposed framework demonstrates a positive performance, attaining ROUGE&#45;2&#10;scores of 39.6% on the VN&#45;MDS dataset and outperforming the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art&#10;baselines.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12134v1) |&#10;| Einstein&#45;dilaton&#45;four&#45;Maxwell Holographic Anisotropic Models | Irina Ya. Aref&#39;eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov | &#160;&#160;In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the&#10;five&#45;dimensional Einstein&#45;dilaton&#45;Maxwell models has played a crucial role.&#10;Typically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while&#10;additional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A&#10;more general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field&#10;represents spatial longitudinal&#45;transverse anisotropy, while the third and&#10;fourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We&#10;consider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero&#10;temperature and five functions at non&#45;zero temperature. Maxwell field related&#10;to the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,&#10;whereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.&#10;We demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of&#10;the seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations &#45;&#45; either the&#10;dilaton or the vector potential equation &#45;&#45; follows from the Einstein equations&#10;and the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi&#10;identity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress&#45;energy&#10;tensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is&#10;provided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to&#10;three Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis&#10;shows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein&#10;equations and the equation for the vector potential&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12131v1) |&#10;| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components&#10; &#160;for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco&#45;Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram | &#160;&#160;Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data&#10;together with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal&#10;components used. It is therefore important to determine the number of&#10;significant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a&#10;variational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for&#10;estimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of&#10;samples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This&#10;eliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of&#10;principal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.&#10;This framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows&#10;and columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),&#10;and with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data&#10;with arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as&#10;cultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our&#10;method on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may&#10;underestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the&#10;synthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical&#10;dataset. These results suggest that it is broadly applicable across the life&#10;sciences.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12129v1) |&#10;| Linguini: A benchmark for language&#45;agnostic linguistic reasoning | Eduardo Sánchez, Belen Alastruey, Christophe Ropers, Pontus Stenetorp, Mikel Artetxe, Marta R.

In this scenario, ultralight&#10;PBHs with masses $M&#10;esssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat&#10;it via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate&#10;whether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH&#10;reheating contains information about the pre&#45;PBH&#45;dominated stage, namely the&#10;initial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer&#10;functions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and&#10;isocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation&#10;of state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH&#10;dominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the&#10;spectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive&#10;to $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density&#10;fluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance&#10;as a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)&#10;observations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the&#10;initial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we&#10;find that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several&#10;future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas,&#10;especially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any&#10;early matter&#45;dominated universe scenario.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12125v1) |&#10;| Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules | Anqi Zhang, Wilson S. Geisler | &#160;&#160;Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We&#10;investigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented&#10;displays having well&#45;separated potential target&#45;object locations. Performance&#10;was compared with the Bayesian&#45;optimal decision process under the assumption&#10;that the information from the different potential target locations is&#10;statistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than&#10;optimal, despite humans&#39; substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the&#10;implausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show&#10;that three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical&#10;results. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near&#10;optimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the&#10;central potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise&#10;causes search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These&#10;findings have far&#45;reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks&#10;and other identification tasks in humans and other animals.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12124v1) |&#10;| Far&#45;from&#45;equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann&#10; &#160;approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows&#10; &#160;$v_n$ | Vincenzo Nugara, Vincenzo Greco, Salvatore Plumari | &#160;&#160;We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal&#10;system in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution&#10;function and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system&#10;sizes $R$ and interaction strength $eta/s$ and identify universality classes&#10;based upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each&#10;of this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $hat&#10;gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results&#10;highlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum&#10;moments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to&#10;a 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of&#10;different sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a&#10;similar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse&#10;flow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system&#10;size and $eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and&#10;their response functions, along with the impact of the $eta/s$ and the system&#10;transverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in&#10;momentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow&#10;$v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of&#10;large opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems&#10;evolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play&#10;in this process.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12123v1) |&#10;| Qwen2.5&#45;Math Technical Report: Toward Mathematical Expert Model via&#10; &#160;Self&#45;Improvement | An Yang, Beichen Zhang, Binyuan Hui, Bofei Gao, Bowen Yu, Chengpeng Li, Dayiheng Liu, Jianhong Tu, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin, Keming Lu, Mingfeng Xue, Runji Lin, Tianyu Liu, Xingzhang Ren, Zhenru Zhang | &#160;&#160;In this report, we present a series of math&#45;specific large language models:&#10;Qwen2.5&#45;Math and Qwen2.5&#45;Math&#45;Instruct&#45;1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the&#10;Qwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self&#45;improvement&#10;throughout the entire pipeline, from pre&#45;training and post&#45;training to&#10;inference: (1) During the pre&#45;training phase, Qwen2&#45;Math&#45;Instruct is utilized&#10;to generate large&#45;scale, high&#45;quality mathematical data. (2) In the&#10;post&#45;training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive&#10;sampling from Qwen2&#45;Math&#45;Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative&#10;evolution of data in supervised fine&#45;tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model,&#10;it&#39;s possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the&#10;next round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the&#10;ultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5&#45;Math&#45;Instruct.&#10;(3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling,&#10;optimizing the model&#39;s performance.&#10; &#160;Qwen2.5&#45;Math&#45;Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced&#10;mathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain&#45;of&#45;Thought (CoT) and&#10;Tool&#45;Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics&#10;datasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and&#10;AIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math&#10;competition problems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12122v1) |&#10;| Computing the $mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two&#45;Dimensional&#10; &#160;Strongly&#45;Correlated Systems | Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn | &#160;&#160;We show that the two&#45;dimensional $mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time&#45;reversal&#10;invariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary&#45;condition&#10;dependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non&#45;interacting and&#10;strongly&#45;correlated insulators. By introducing a family of quasi&#45;single&#10;particle states associated to the many&#45;body ground state of an insulator, we&#10;show that the $mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant can be expressed as the integral of a&#10;certain Berry connection over half the space of boundary conditions, providing&#10;an alternative expression to the formulations that appear in [Lee et al., Phys.&#10;Rev. Lett. $textbf{100}$, 186807 (2008)]. We show the equivalence of the&#10;different many&#45;body formulations of the invariant, and show how they reduce to&#10;known band&#45;theoretic results for Slater determinant ground states. Finally, we&#10;apply our results to analytically calculate the invariant for the Kane&#45;Mele&#10;model with nonlocal (orbital) Hatsugai&#45;Kohmoto (HK) interactions. This&#10;rigorously establishes the topological nontriviality of the Kane&#45;Mele model&#10;with HK interactions, and represents one of the few exact calculations of the&#10;$mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a strongly&#45;interacting system.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12120v1) |&#10;| Weak Lensing analysis of Abell 2390 using short exposures | A. Dutta, J. R. Peterson, T. Rose, M. Cianfaglione, A. Bonafede, G. Li, G. Sembroski | &#160;&#160;We present a weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 2390 at z =&#10;0.23 using second moment shape measurements made in 411 short 60s exposures.&#10;The exposures are obtained in three broadband photometric filters (g, r, i)&#10;using WIYN&#45;ODI. Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a&#10;moment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching&#10;algorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The&#10;measurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight&#10;to obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim&#10;simulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find&#10;the mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We&#10;also find the E&#45;Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic&#10;structures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical&#10;and X&#45;Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to&#10;map large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of&#10;the cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the&#10;peaks are similar to X&#45;Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster&#10;and show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12119v1) |&#10;| Low Frame&#45;rate Speech Codec: a Codec Designed for Fast High&#45;quality&#10; &#160;Speech LLM Training and Inference | Edresson Casanova, Ryan Langman, Paarth Neekhara, Shehzeen Hussain, Jason Li, Subhankar Ghosh, Ante Jukić, Sang&#45;gil Lee | &#160;&#160;Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing&#10;through audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the&#10;application of language modeling techniques to audio data. However, audio&#10;codecs often operate at high frame rates, resulting in slow training and&#10;inference, especially for autoregressive models. To address this challenge, we&#10;present the Low Frame&#45;rate Speech Codec (LFSC): a neural audio codec that&#10;leverages finite scalar quantization and adversarial training with large speech&#10;language models to achieve high&#45;quality audio compression with a 1.89 kbps&#10;bitrate and 21.5 frames per second. We demonstrate that our novel codec can&#10;make the inference of LLM&#45;based text&#45;to&#45;speech models around three times faster&#10;while improving intelligibility and producing quality comparable to previous&#10;models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12117v1) |&#10;| Stronger Baseline Models &#45;&#45; A Key Requirement for Aligning Machine&#10; &#160;Learning Research with Clinical Utility | Nathan Wolfrath, Joel Wolfrath, Hengrui Hu, Anjishnu Banerjee, Anai N. Kothari | &#160;&#160;Machine Learning (ML) research has increased substantially in recent years,&#10;due to the success of predictive modeling across diverse application domains.&#10;However, well&#45;known barriers exist when attempting to deploy ML models in&#10;high&#45;stakes, clinical settings, including lack of model transparency (or the&#10;inability to audit the inference process), large training data requirements&#10;with siloed data sources, and complicated metrics for measuring model utility.&#10;In this work, we show empirically that including stronger baseline models in&#10;healthcare ML evaluations has important downstream effects that aid&#10;practitioners in addressing these challenges. Through a series of case studies,&#10;we find that the common practice of omitting baselines or comparing against a&#10;weak baseline model (e.g. a linear model with no optimization) obscures the&#10;value of ML methods proposed in the research literature. Using these insights,&#10;we propose some best practices that will enable practitioners to more&#10;effectively study and deploy ML models in clinical settings.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12116v1) |&#10;| Revisiting Dark Photon Constraints from CMB Spectral Distortions | Jens Chluba, Bryce Cyr, Matthew C. Johnson | &#160;&#160;Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide&#10;stringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post&#45;BBN (Big&#10;Bang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models&#10;with COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.&#10;Here, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark&#10;photon conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous&#10;works only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the&#10;change to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon&#10;distortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the&#10;distortion has an opposite sign and a $simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We&#10;furthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover&#10;the redshift range $simeq 2times 10^6&#45;4times 10^7$ between the $mu$&#45;era and&#10;the end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints&#10;for dark photon masses in the range $10^{&#45;4},{&#13;m eV}&#10;esssim m_{&#13;m&#10;dp}&#10;esssim 10^{&#45;3},{&#13;m eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We&#10;demonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon&#10;to dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $mu$&#45;type distortion&#10;independent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study&#10;dark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with&#10;CMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12115v1) |&#10;| Bi&#45;objective trail&#45;planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous&#10; &#160;environment | Cory M. Simon, Jeffrey Richley, Lucas Overbey, Darleen Perez&#45;Lavin | &#160;&#160;Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in&#10;resource delivery, patrolling, information&#45;gathering, agriculture, forest fire&#10;fighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and&#10;search&#45;and&#45;rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments &#45;&#45; with e.g.&#10;rough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or&#10;capturing robots &#45;&#45; should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of&#10;risks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should&#10;take the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the&#10;team&#45;level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward&#10;from visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider&#10;bi&#45;objective trail&#45;planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a&#10;hazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed&#10;graph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of&#10;survival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a&#10;robot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for&#10;the Pareto&#45;optimal robot&#45;team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team&#10;objectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive&#10;the mission. A human decision&#45;maker can then select trail plans that balance,&#10;according to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony&#10;optimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto&#45;optimal set of&#10;robot team trail plans. As a case study, we illustrate with an&#10;information&#45;gathering mission in an art museum.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12114v1) |&#10;| Pareto Data Framework: Steps Towards Resource&#45;Efficient Decision Making&#10; &#160;Using Minimum Viable Data (MVD) | Tashfain Ahmed, Josh Siegel | &#160;&#160;This paper introduces the Pareto Data Framework, an approach for identifying&#10;and selecting the Minimum Viable Data (MVD) required for enabling machine&#10;learning applications on constrained platforms such as embedded systems, mobile&#10;devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We demonstrate that strategic&#10;data reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing&#10;bandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies&#10;Minimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource&#45;constrained&#10;environments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient&#10;practices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and&#10;overprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for&#10;optimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data&#10;representation. An experimental methodology demonstrates effective acoustic&#10;data characterization after downsampling, quantization, and truncation to&#10;simulate reduced&#45;fidelity sensors and network and storage constraints; results&#10;shows that performance can be maintained up to 95% with sample rates reduced&#10;by 75% and bit depths and clip length reduced by 50% which translates into&#10;substantial cost and resource reduction. These findings have implications on&#10;the design and development of constrained systems. The paper also discusses&#10;broader implications of the framework, including the potential to democratize&#10;advanced AI technologies across IoT applications and sectors such as&#10;agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing to improve access and multiply&#10;the benefits of data&#45;driven insights.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12112v1) |&#10;| Applications of Knowledge Distillation in Remote Sensing: A Survey | Yassine Himeur, Nour Aburaed, Omar Elharrouss, Iraklis Varlamis, Shadi Atalla, Wathiq Mansoor, Hussain Al Ahmad | &#160;&#160;With the ever&#45;growing complexity of models in the field of remote sensing&#10;(RS), there is an increasing demand for solutions that balance model accuracy&#10;with computational efficiency. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a&#10;powerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,&#10;complex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in&#10;performance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and&#10;its innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer&#10;knowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact&#10;and efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application&#10;across various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and&#10;historical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are&#10;highlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational&#10;efficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical&#10;deployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of&#10;KD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the&#10;breadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case&#10;studies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,&#10;such as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review&#10;discusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical&#10;constraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive&#10;overview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS. Through this&#10;organization, the paper not only elucidates the current state of research in KD&#10;but also sets the stage for future research opportunities, thereby contributing&#10;significantly to both academic research and real&#45;world applications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12111v1) |&#10;| It depends: Varieties of defining growth dependence | Anja Janischewski, Katharina Bohnenberger, Matthias Kranke, Tobias Vogel, Riwan Driouich, Tobias Froese, Stefanie Gerold, Raphael Kaufmann, Lorenz Keyßer, Jannis Niethammer, Christopher Olk, Matthias Schmelzer, Aslı Yürük, Steffen Lange | &#160;&#160;Many socio&#45;economic systems require positive economic growth rates to&#10;function properly. Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing&#10;evidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,&#10;these growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,&#10;more and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth&#45;dependent systems&#10;and develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of&#10;&#39;growth dependence&#39; still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,&#10;which impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article&#10;proposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the&#10;concept of &#39;growth dependence&#39; across socio&#45;economic systems. We provide a&#10;general definition consisting of four components that can be specified for&#10;different empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of&#10;measurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions&#10;or properties of the system under investigation. According to our general&#10;definition, a socio&#45;economic system is growth&#45;dependent if it requires a&#10;long&#45;term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to&#10;maintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen&#10;normative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to&#10;three areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:&#10;employment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies&#10;demonstrate that whether or not a system is growth&#45;dependent hinges not only on&#10;the empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of&#10;the concept of growth dependence. Our framework enables coherent, robust and&#10;effective definitions and research questions, fostering comparability of&#10;findings across different cases and disciplines.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12109v1) |&#10;| SPRMamba: Surgical Phase Recognition for Endoscopic Submucosal&#10; &#160;Dissection with Mamba | Xiangning Zhang, Jinnan Chen, Qingwei Zhang, Chengfeng Zhou, Zhengjie Zhang, Xiaobo Li, Dahong Qian | &#160;&#160;Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive procedure&#10;initially designed for the treatment of early gastric cancer but is now widely&#10;used for various gastrointestinal lesions. Computer&#45;assisted Surgery systems&#10;have played a crucial role in improving the precision and safety of ESD&#10;procedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognition&#10;of surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesion&#10;characteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real&#45;time&#10;surgical phase recognition algorithms. Existing surgical phase recognition&#10;algorithms struggle to efficiently capture temporal contexts in video&#45;based&#10;scenarios, leading to insufficient performance. To address these issues, we&#10;propose SPRMamba, a novel Mamba&#45;based framework for ESD surgical phase&#10;recognition. SPRMamba leverages the strengths of Mamba for long&#45;term temporal&#10;modeling while introducing the Scaled Residual TranMamba block to enhance the&#10;capture of fine&#45;grained details, overcoming the limitations of traditional&#10;temporal models like Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformers.&#10;Moreover, a Temporal Sample Strategy is introduced to accelerate the&#10;processing, which is essential for real&#45;time phase recognition in clinical&#10;settings. Extensive testing on the ESD385 dataset and the cholecystectomy&#10;Cholec80 dataset demonstrates that SPRMamba surpasses existing state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art&#10;methods and exhibits greater robustness across various surgical phase&#10;recognition tasks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12108v1) |&#10;| Who&#39;s the GOAT?

In this work, we design a&#10;data&#45;driven random walk on the symmetric group to obtain a stationary&#10;distribution over player rankings, spanning across different time periods in&#10;sports history. We combine this distribution with a notion of stochastic&#10;dominance to obtain a partial order over the players.

Recent advances in AI have sparked renewed interest in this area, with&#10;large language models (LLMs) emerging as both tools and subjects of value&#10;measurement. This work introduces Generative Psychometrics for Values (GPV), an&#10;LLM&#45;based, data&#45;driven value measurement paradigm, theoretically grounded in&#10;text&#45;revealed selective perceptions. We begin by fine&#45;tuning an LLM for&#10;accurate perception&#45;level value measurement and verifying the capability of&#10;LLMs to parse texts into perceptions, forming the core of the GPV pipeline.&#10;Applying GPV to human&#45;authored blogs, we demonstrate its stability, validity,&#10;and superiority over prior psychological tools. Then, extending GPV to LLM&#10;value measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometric&#10;methodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free&#45;form&#10;outputs, enabling context&#45;specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis of&#10;measurement paradigms, indicating response biases of prior methods; and 3) an&#10;attempt to bridge LLM values and their safety, revealing the predictive power&#10;of different value systems and the impacts of various values on LLM safety.&#10;Through interdisciplinary efforts, we aim to leverage AI for next&#45;generation&#10;psychometrics and psychometrics for value&#45;aligned AI.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12106v1) |&#10;| FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated&#10; &#160;Long&#45;Tailed Learning | Xiuhua Lu, Peng Li, Xuefeng Jiang | &#160;&#160;Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy&#10;in distributed machine learning. However, datasets distributed across each&#10;client in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can&#10;be globally aggregated, they tend to be long&#45;tailed distributed, which greatly&#10;affects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated&#10;learning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it&#10;fails to address the phenomenon of class&#45;wise bias in global long&#45;tailed data.&#10;This results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting&#10;the equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a&#10;methodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,&#10;we propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the&#10;local training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred&#10;optimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art&#10;methods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long&#45;tailed&#10;distribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR&#45;10&#45;LT and&#10;CIFAR&#45;100&#45;LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of&#10;model performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long&#45;tailed&#10;distribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12105v1) |&#10;| Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error&#10; &#160;Detection | Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia | &#160;&#160;Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real&#45;world applications. Doing&#10;so requires overcoming the noise present on today&#39;s hardware. The quantum&#10;approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling&#10;up due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup&#10;over state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art classical algorithms for some problems. However,&#10;achieving better&#45;than&#45;classical performance with QAOA is believed to require&#10;fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault&#45;tolerant&#10;implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg&#39;&#39; error detection&#10;code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the&#10;algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with&#10;up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped&#45;ion quantum computer. Additionally, we&#10;propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance, and use it&#10;to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance&#10;to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our&#10;model can be used to determine necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform&#10;Goemans&#45;Williamson algorithm on future hardware. Our results demonstrate the&#10;largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially&#10;fault&#45;tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date,&#10;paving the way towards solving real&#45;world applications with quantum computers.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12104v1) |&#10;| Cyclicity Analysis of the Ornstein&#45;Uhlenbeck Process | Vivek Kaushik | &#160;&#160;In this thesis, we consider an $N$&#45;dimensional Ornstein&#45;Uhlenbeck (OU)&#10;process satisfying the linear stochastic differential equation $dmathbf x(t) =&#10;&#45; mathbf Bmathbf x(t) dt + boldsymbol Sigma d mathbf w(t).$ Here, $mathbf&#10;B$ is a fixed $N times N$ circulant friction matrix whose eigenvalues have&#10;positive real parts, $boldsymbol Sigma$ is a fixed $N times M$ matrix. We&#10;consider a signal propagation model governed by this OU process. In this model,&#10;an underlying signal propagates throughout a network consisting of $N$ linked&#10;sensors located in space. We interpret the $n$&#45;th component of the OU process&#10;as the measurement of the propagating effect made by the $n$&#45;th sensor. The&#10;matrix $mathbf B$ represents the sensor network structure: if $mathbf B$ has&#10;first row $(b_1 &#160;, &#160;dots &#160;, &#160;b_N),$ where $b_1&gt;0$ and $b_2 &#160;, &#160;dots , b_N &#10;e 0,$ then the magnitude of $b_p$ quantifies how receptive the $n$&#45;th&#10;sensor is to activity within the $(n+p&#45;1)$&#45;th sensor. Finally, the $(m,n)$&#45;th&#10;entry of the matrix $mathbf D = frac{boldsymbol Sigma boldsymbol&#10;Sigma^text T}{2}$ is the covariance of the component noises injected into the&#10;$m$&#45;th and $n$&#45;th sensors. For different choices of $mathbf B$ and&#10;$boldsymbol Sigma,$ we investigate whether Cyclicity Analysis enables us to&#10;recover the structure of network. Roughly speaking, Cyclicity Analysis studies&#10;the lead&#45;lag dynamics pertaining to the components of a multivariate signal. We&#10;specifically consider an $N times N$ skew&#45;symmetric matrix $mathbf Q,$ known&#10;as the lead matrix, in which the sign of its $(m,n)$&#45;th entry captures the&#10;lead&#45;lag relationship between the $m$&#45;th and $n$&#45;th component OU processes. We&#10;investigate whether the structure of the leading eigenvector of $mathbf Q,$&#10;the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of $mathbf Q$ in&#10;modulus, reflects the network structure induced by $mathbf B.$&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12102v1) |&#10;| Symmetry&#45;Enriched Learning: A Category&#45;Theoretic Framework for Robust&#10; &#160;Machine Learning Models | Ronald Katende | &#160;&#160;This manuscript presents a novel framework that integrates higher&#45;order&#10;symmetries and category theory into machine learning. We introduce new&#10;mathematical constructs, including hyper&#45;symmetry categories and functorial&#10;representations, to model complex transformations within learning algorithms.&#10;Our contributions include the design of symmetry&#45;enriched learning models, the&#10;development of advanced optimization techniques leveraging categorical&#10;symmetries, and the theoretical analysis of their implications for model&#10;robustness, generalization, and convergence. Through rigorous proofs and&#10;practical applications, we demonstrate that incorporating higher&#45;dimensional&#10;categorical structures enhances both the theoretical foundations and practical&#10;capabilities of modern machine learning algorithms, opening new directions for&#10;research and innovation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12100v1) |&#10;| Brain&#45;Streams: fMRI&#45;to&#45;Image Reconstruction with Multi&#45;modal Guidance | Jaehoon Joo, Taejin Jeong, Seongjae Hwang | &#160;&#160;Understanding how humans process visual information is one of the crucial&#10;steps for unraveling the underlying mechanism of brain activity. Recently, this&#10;curiosity has motivated the fMRI&#45;to&#45;image reconstruction task; given the fMRI&#10;data from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual&#10;stimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent&#10;Diffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex&#10;visual stimuli such as high&#45;resolution natural images from vision datasets.&#10;Despite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often&#10;lack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.&#10;Consequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere&#10;visuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs&#10;effectively incorporate multi&#45;modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,&#10;and image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image&#10;generations. Specifically, inspired by the two&#45;streams hypothesis suggesting&#10;that perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain&#10;regions, our framework, Brain&#45;Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain&#10;regions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from&#10;semantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information&#10;regions, Brain&#45;Streams provides accurate multi&#45;modal guidance to LDMs. We&#10;validate the reconstruction ability of Brain&#45;Streams both quantitatively and&#10;qualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI&#10;data.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12099v1) |&#10;| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal&#10; &#160;execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huyên Pham | &#160;&#160;Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and&#10;constraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity&#10;markets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general&#10;propagator model under linear functional inequality constraints. The optimal&#10;control is given explicitly in terms of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers&#10;and their conditional expectations, as a solution to a linear stochastic&#10;Fredholm equation. We propose a stochastic version of the Uzawa algorithm on&#10;the dual problem to construct the stochastic Lagrange multipliers numerically&#10;via a stochastic projected gradient ascent, combined with a least&#45;squares Monte&#10;Carlo regression step to approximate their conditional expectations. We&#10;illustrate our findings on two different practical applications with stochastic&#10;signals: (i) an optimal execution problem with an exponential or a power law&#10;decaying transient impact, with either a `no&#45;shorting&#39; constraint in the&#10;presence of a `sell&#39; signal, a `no&#45;buying&#39; constraint in the presence of a&#10;`buy&#39; signal or a stochastic `stop&#45;trading&#39; constraint whenever the exogenous&#10;price drops below a specified reference level; (ii) a battery storage problem&#10;with instantaneous operating costs, seasonal signals and fixed constraints on&#10;both the charging power and the load capacity of the battery.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12098v1) |&#10;| Skill matching at scale: freelancer&#45;project alignment for efficient&#10; &#160;multilingual candidate retrieval | Warren Jouanneau, Marc Palyart, Emma Jouffroy | &#160;&#160;Finding the perfect match between a job proposal and a set of freelancers is&#10;not an easy task to perform at scale, especially in multiple languages. In this&#10;paper, we propose a novel neural retriever architecture that tackles this&#10;problem in a multilingual setting. Our method encodes project descriptions and&#10;freelancer profiles by leveraging pre&#45;trained multilingual language models. The&#10;latter are used as backbone for a custom transformer architecture that aims to&#10;keep the structure of the profiles and project. This model is trained with a&#10;contrastive loss on historical data. Thanks to several experiments, we show&#10;that this approach effectively captures skill matching similarity and&#10;facilitates efficient matching, outperforming traditional methods.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12097v2) |&#10;| An Efficient Projection&#45;Based Next&#45;best&#45;view Planning Framework for&#10; &#160;Reconstruction of Unknown Objects | Zhizhou Jia, Shaohui Zhang, Qun Hao | &#160;&#160;Efficiently and completely capturing the three&#45;dimensional data of an object&#10;is a fundamental problem in industrial and robotic applications. The task of&#10;next&#45;best&#45;view (NBV) planning is to infer the pose of the next viewpoint based&#10;on the current data, and gradually realize the complete three&#45;dimensional&#10;reconstruction. Many existing algorithms, however, suffer a large computational&#10;burden due to the use of ray&#45;casting. To address this, this paper proposes a&#10;projection&#45;based NBV planning framework. It can select the next best view at an&#10;extremely fast speed while ensuring the complete scanning of the object.&#10;Specifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into&#10;ellipsoids based on the voxel structure.Then, the next best view is selected&#10;from the candidate views using a projection&#45;based viewpoint quality evaluation&#10;function in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy. This process&#10;replaces the ray&#45;casting in voxel structures, significantly improving the&#10;computational efficiency. Comparative experiments with other algorithms in a&#10;simulation environment show that the framework proposed in this paper can&#10;achieve 10 times efficiency improvement on the basis of capturing roughly the&#10;same coverage. The real&#45;world experimental results also prove the efficiency&#10;and feasibility of the framework.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12096v1) |&#10;| Undersampling effects on observed periods of coronal oscillations | Daye Lim, Tom Van Doorsselaere, Valery M. Nakariakov, Dmitrii Y. Kolotkov, Yuhang Gao, David Berghmans | &#160;&#160;Context. Recent observations of decayless transverse oscillations have shown&#10;two branches in the relationship between periods and loop lengths. One is a&#10;linear relationship, interpreted as a standing mode. The other shows almost no&#10;correlation and has not yet been interpreted conclusively. Aims. We&#10;investigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless&#10;oscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely&#10;follow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations&#10;are standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations&#10;where the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase&#10;are randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal&#10;by considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of&#10;telescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast&#10;Fourier transform. Results. When the sampling cadence is getting closer to the&#10;actual oscillation period, a tendency for overestimating periods in short loops&#10;is enhanced. The relationship between loop lengths and periods of the sampled&#10;signals shows the two branches as in the observation. Conclusions. We find that&#10;long periods of decayless oscillations occurring in short loops could be the&#10;result of undersampling.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12095v1) |&#10;| Enwrapped Perylene Bisimide Enables Room Temperature Polariton Lasing&#10; &#160;and Photonic Lattices | Dominik Horneber, Johannes Düreth, Tim Schembri, Simon Betzold, Matthias Stolte, Sven Höfling, Frank Würthner, Sebastian Klembt | &#160;&#160;Perylene bisimides (PBIs) are organic dyes with photoluminescence quantum&#10;yields (PLQY) close to unity in solution and great thermal and photo&#45;chemical&#10;stability. These features alongside the tunability of their solid&#45;state packing&#10;arrangement via chemical functionalization make this material class an&#10;excellent candidate for exciton&#45;polariton lasing at room temperature. Polariton&#10;lasing is well understood in III&#45;V semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures,&#10;however, the search for emitter materials for robust and versatile room&#10;temperature applications is ongoing. While e.g. perovskites and several organic&#10;materials have been identified to support polariton lasing, many of these&#10;materials lack tunability and long&#45;term stability under ambient conditions.&#10;Here, we fabricate optical microcavities using a strongly enwrapped PBI&#10;chromophore with prevailing monomer&#45;like absorption and emission properties in&#10;the solid state. Voluminous bay&#45;substituents prevent stacking induced&#10;PLQY&#45;quenching, thereby enabling polariton lasing at room temperature.&#10;Additionally, photonic confinement in single hemispheric resonators is&#10;demonstrated leading to localized polaritonic modes with discrete energies, as&#10;well as optical lattices revealing distinct polaritonic band&#45;structures. Due to&#10;the possibility of tunable properties by the precise control of the solid&#45;state&#10;packing arrangement of PBI emitters, our results pave the way for&#10;polarization&#45;dependent light&#45;matter coupling, including topological photonic&#10;effects within oriented crystalline thin&#45;film microcavity structures.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12093v1) |&#10;| IMRL: Integrating Visual, Physical, Temporal, and Geometric&#10; &#160;Representations for Enhanced Food Acquisition | Rui Liu, Zahiruddin Mahammad, Amisha Bhaskar, Pratap Tokekar | &#160;&#160;Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality&#10;of life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse&#10;food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents&#10;unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface&#45;level geometric&#10;information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g.,&#10;color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially&#10;when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance.&#10;We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition.&#10;Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy&#10;based on off&#45;the&#45;shelf image encoders such as ResNet&#45;50. However, such&#10;representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse&#10;acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel&#10;approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi&#45;Dimensional Representation Learning), which&#10;integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance&#10;the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach&#10;captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi&#45;solid, granular,&#10;liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and&#10;introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and&#10;assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies&#10;based on context, improving the robot&#39;s capability to handle diverse food&#10;acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach&#39;s&#10;robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations,&#10;including zero&#45;shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves&#10;improvement up to $35%$ in success rate compared with the best&#45;performing&#10;baseline.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12092v1) |&#10;| Uncovering liquid&#45;substrate fluctuation effects on crystal growth and&#10; &#160;disordered hyperuniformity of two&#45;dimensional materials | S. K. Mkhonta, Zhi&#45;Feng Huang, K. R. Elder | &#160;&#160;We investigate the growth of two&#45;dimensional (2D) crystals on fluctuating&#10;surfaces using a phase field crystal model that is relevant on atomic length&#10;and diffusive time scales. Motivated by recent experiments which achieved&#10;unprecedented fast growth of large&#45;size high&#45;quality 2D crystals on liquid&#10;substrates, we uncover novel effects of liquid surfaces on microstructural&#10;ordering. We find that substrate fluctuations generate short&#45;ranged noise that&#10;speeds up crystallization and grain growth of the overlayer, surpassing that of&#10;free&#45;standing system. Coupling to the liquid substrate fluctuations can also&#10;modulate local randomness, leading to intriguing disordered structures with&#10;hidden spatial order, i.e., disordered hyperuniformity. These results reveal&#10;the physical mechanisms underlying the fast growth of 2D crystals on liquid&#10;surfaces and demonstrate a novel strategy for synthesizing disordered&#10;hyperuniform thin film structures.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12090v1) |&#10;| The Impact of Element Ordering on LM Agent Performance | Wayne Chi, Ameet Talwalkar, Chris Donahue | &#160;&#160;There has been a surge of interest in language model agents that can navigate&#10;virtual environments such as the web or desktop. To navigate such environments,&#10;agents benefit from information on the various elements (e.g., buttons, text,&#10;or images) present. It remains unclear which element attributes have the&#10;greatest impact on agent performance, especially in environments that only&#10;provide a graphical representation (i.e., pixels). Here we find that the&#10;ordering in which elements are presented to the language model is surprisingly&#10;impactful&#45;&#45;randomizing element ordering in a webpage degrades agent performance&#10;comparably to removing all visible text from an agent&#39;s state representation.&#10;While a webpage provides a hierarchical ordering of elements, there is no such&#10;ordering when parsing elements directly from pixels. Moreover, as tasks become&#10;more challenging and models more sophisticated, our experiments suggest that&#10;the impact of ordering increases. Finding an effective ordering is non&#45;trivial.&#10;We investigate the impact of various element ordering methods in web and&#10;desktop environments. We find that dimensionality reduction provides a viable&#10;ordering for pixel&#45;only environments. We train a UI element detection model to&#10;derive elements from pixels and apply our findings to an agent&#10;benchmark&#45;&#45;OmniACT&#45;&#45;where we only have access to pixels. Our method completes&#10;more than two times as many tasks on average relative to the previous&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12089v2) |&#10;| Quark saturation in the QCD phase diagram | Marcus Bluhm, Yuki Fujimoto, Larry McLerran, Marlene Nahrgang | &#160;&#160;We determine the onset of Quarkyonic Matter corresponding to values of&#10;temperature and baryon chemical potential at which the quark phase space&#10;density becomes one. At zero temperature for baryon chemical potentials below&#10;the mass of the Lambda baryon, only nucleons contribute to the quark density.&#10;This is different at finite temperature, where all baryons, mesons and their&#10;resonances can be excited and thus add quarks to the phase space. The&#10;probability density to find a quark inside a hadron is determined using the&#10;Yukawa ansatz of the IdylliQ model of Quarkyonic Matter. We estimate separately&#10;the magnitude of the various contributions of nucleons, Delta baryons, pions as&#10;well as further hadrons and resonances. The uncertainty in the parametrization&#10;of the probability density to find a quark inside a nucleon is spanned by&#10;assuming that at zero temperature the transition density to Quarkyonic Matter&#10;is between one and three times that of nuclear matter. Various predictions for&#10;a possible critical point associated with the chiral phase transition are found&#10;close to a triple point at which the line of the deconfinement transition and&#10;the curve associated with the transition to Quarkyonic Matter intersect. These&#10;considerations provide an estimate for the region in the QCD phase diagram&#10;where Quarkyonic Matter may be found.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12088v1) |&#10;| Towards Interpretable End&#45;Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Prediction:&#10; &#160;Utilizing Administrative Claims Data with Explainable AI Techniques | Yubo Li, Saba Al&#45;Sayouri, Rema Padman | &#160;&#160;This study explores the potential of utilizing administrative claims data,&#10;combined with advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, to&#10;predict the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to End&#45;Stage Renal&#10;Disease (ESRD). We analyze a comprehensive, 10&#45;year dataset provided by a major&#10;health insurance organization to develop prediction models for multiple&#10;observation windows using traditional machine learning methods such as Random&#10;Forest and XGBoost as well as deep learning approaches such as Long Short&#45;Term&#10;Memory (LSTM) networks.

Agyeman, Jinfeng Liu, Sirish L. Shah | &#160;&#160;Efficient water management in agriculture is important for mitigating the&#10;growing freshwater scarcity crisis. Mixed&#45;integer Model Predictive Control&#10;(MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex&#10;scheduling problems in agricultural irrigation. However, the computational&#10;complexity of mixed&#45;integer MPC still poses a significant challenge,&#10;particularly in large&#45;scale applications. This study proposes an approach to&#10;enhance the computational efficiency of mixed&#45;integer MPC&#45;based irrigation&#10;schedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture&#10;dynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed&#45;integer linear&#10;representation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the&#10;mixed&#45;integer MPC&#45;based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a&#10;mixed&#45;integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed&#45;integer&#10;nonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global&#10;optimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated&#10;through comparative studies conducted on a large&#45;scale agricultural field&#10;across two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models,&#10;specifically Long Short&#45;Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used&#10;triggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU&#45;based approach significantly&#10;reduces solution times &#45;&#45; by up to 99.5% &#45;&#45; while achieving comparable&#10;performance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water&#10;Use Efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, the ReLU&#45;based approach maintains enhanced&#10;performance in terms of total prescribed irrigation and IWUE compared to the&#10;widely&#45;used triggered irrigation scheduling method.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12082v1) |&#10;| Design of Ligand&#45;Binding Proteins with Atomic Flow Matching | Junqi Liu, Shaoning Li, Chence Shi, Zhi Yang, Jian Tang | &#160;&#160;Designing novel proteins that bind to small molecules is a long&#45;standing&#10;challenge in computational biology, with applications in developing catalysts,&#10;biosensors, and more. Current computational methods rely on the assumption that&#10;the binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible,&#10;as conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon&#10;binding. In this work, we formulate proteins and molecules as unified&#10;biotokens, and present AtomFlow, a novel deep generative model under the&#10;flow&#45;matching framework for the design of ligand&#45;binding proteins from the 2D&#10;target molecular graph alone. Operating on representative atoms of biotokens,&#10;AtomFlow captures the flexibility of ligands and generates ligand conformations&#10;and protein backbone structures iteratively. We consider the multi&#45;scale nature&#10;of biotokens and demonstrate that AtomFlow can be effectively trained on a&#10;subset of structures from the Protein Data Bank, by matching flow vector field&#10;using an SE(3) equivariant structure prediction network. Experimental results&#10;show that our method can generate high fidelity ligand&#45;binding proteins and&#10;achieve performance comparable to the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art model RFDiffusionAA,&#10;while not requiring bound ligand structures.

Wehrheim, Lucas Zinz, Johanna Rahm, Ashwin Balakrishnan, Alexandra Kaminer, Mike Heilemann, Matthias Kaschube | &#160;&#160;Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at&#10;the nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological&#10;organization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of&#10;fluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses&#10;remain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced&#10;laser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and&#10;increased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a&#10;denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high&#45;resolution&#10;images by conditioning the model on low&#45;resolution information. Additionally,&#10;the probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images&#10;that tend to further increase the signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio. We show that our model&#10;achieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously&#10;best&#45;performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly,&#10;while any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but&#10;not all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all&#10;four data sets, suggesting high generalizability.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12078v1) |&#10;| Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Via Data Pruning | Andrea Napoli, Paul White | &#160;&#160;The removal of carefully&#45;selected examples from training data has recently&#10;emerged as an effective way of improving the robustness of machine learning&#10;models. However, the best way to select these examples remains an open&#10;question. In this paper, we consider the problem from the perspective of&#10;unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). We propose AdaPrune, a method for UDA&#10;whereby training examples are removed to attempt to align the training&#10;distribution to that of the target data. By adopting the maximum mean&#10;discrepancy (MMD) as the criterion for alignment, the problem can be neatly&#10;formulated and solved as an integer quadratic program. We evaluate our approach&#10;on a real&#45;world domain shift task of bioacoustic event detection. As a method&#10;for UDA, we show that AdaPrune outperforms related techniques, and is&#10;complementary to other UDA algorithms such as CORAL. Our analysis of the&#10;relationship between the MMD and model accuracy, along with t&#45;SNE plots,&#10;validate the proposed method as a principled and well&#45;founded way of performing&#10;data pruning.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12076v1) |&#10;| The elastica sling | Alessandro Cazzolli, Francesco Dal Corso | &#160;&#160;The nonlinear mechanics of a flexible elastic rod constrained at its edges by&#10;a pair of sliding sleeves is analyzed. The planar equilibrium configurations of&#10;this variable&#45;length elastica are found to have shape defined only by the&#10;inclination of the two constraints, while their distance is responsible only&#10;for scaling the size. By extending the theoretical stability criterion&#10;available for systems under isoperimetric constraints to the case of variable&#10;domains, the existence of no more than one stable equilibrium solution is&#10;revealed. The set of sliding sleeves&#39; inclination pairs for which the stability&#10;is lost are identified. Such critical conditions allow the indefinite ejection&#10;of the flexible rod from the sliding sleeves, thus realizing an elastica sling.&#10;Finally, the theoretical findings are validated by experiments on a physical&#10;prototype. The present results lead to a novel actuation principle that may&#10;find application as a mechanism in energy harvesting, wave mitigation devices,&#10;and soft robotic locomotion.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12075v1) |&#10;| Online Refractive Camera Model Calibration in Visual Inertial Odometry | Mohit Singh, Kostas Alexis | &#160;&#160;This paper presents a general refractive camera model and online&#10;co&#45;estimation of odometry and the refractive index of unknown media. This&#10;enables operation in diverse and varying refractive fluids, given only the&#10;camera calibration in air. The refractive index is estimated online as a state&#10;variable of a monocular visual&#45;inertial odometry framework in an iterative&#10;formulation using the proposed camera model. The method was verified on data&#10;collected using an underwater robot traversing inside a pool. The evaluations&#10;demonstrate convergence to the ideal refractive index for water despite&#10;significant perturbations in the initialization. Simultaneously, the approach&#10;enables on&#45;par visual&#45;inertial odometry performance in refractive media without&#10;prior knowledge of the refractive index or requirement of medium&#45;specific&#10;camera calibration.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12074v1) |&#10;| Influence of dislocations in multilayer graphene stacks: A phase field&#10; &#160;crystal study | K. R. Elder, Zhi&#45;Feng Huang, T. Ala&#45;Nissila | &#160;&#160;In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene&#10;stacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a&#10;recently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems&#10;incorporating out&#45;of&#45;plane deformations and parameterized to match to density&#10;functional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems. The&#10;specific configuration considered consists of one monolayer containing four&#10;$5|7$ dislocations (i.e., two dislocation dipoles) sandwiched in between&#10;perfect graphene layers. The study reveals how the strain field from the&#10;dislocations in the defected layer leads to out&#45;of&#45;plane deformations that in&#10;turn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are&#10;made for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a&#10;defect&#45;free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and&#10;system size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by&#10;roughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence&#10;across the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height&#10;profiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12073v1) |&#10;| PAD&#45;FT: A Lightweight Defense for Backdoor Attacks via Data Purification&#10; &#160;and Fine&#45;Tuning | Yukai Xu, Yujie Gu, Kouichi Sakurai | &#160;&#160;Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks,&#10;particularly as recent advancements have led to increasingly subtle&#10;implantation, making the defense more challenging. Existing defense mechanisms&#10;typically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and&#10;involve retraining an auxiliary model or fine&#45;tuning the entire victim model.&#10;However, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always&#10;feasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and&#10;lightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD&#45;FT, that does not require an&#10;additional clean dataset and fine&#45;tunes only a very small part of the model to&#10;disinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a&#10;simple data purification process to identify and select the most&#45;likely clean&#10;data from the poisoned training dataset. The self&#45;purified clean dataset is&#10;then used for activation clipping and fine&#45;tuning only the last classification&#10;layer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation&#10;clipping, and classifier fine&#45;tuning, our mechanism PAD&#45;FT demonstrates&#10;superior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as&#10;confirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12072v1) |&#10;| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing&#10; &#160;data in Irish sagas | P. MacCarron | &#160;&#160;For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts&#10;in order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify&#10;similarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the&#10;significance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture&#10;requires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and&#10;often impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the&#10;network of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that&#10;the top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent&#10;with central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has&#10;been lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust&#10;to a large random removal of edges.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12071v1) |&#10;| The repetition threshold for ternary rich words | James D. Currie, Lucas Mol, Jarkko Peltomäki | &#160;&#160;In 2014, Vesti proposed the problem of determining the repetition threshold&#10;for infinite rich words, i.e., for infinite words in which all factors of&#10;length $n$ contain $n$ distinct nonempty palindromic factors. In 2020, Currie,&#10;Mol, and Rampersad proved a conjecture of Baranwal and Shallit that the&#10;repetition threshold for binary rich words is $2 + sqrt{2}/2$. In this paper,&#10;we prove a structure theorem for $16/7$&#45;power&#45;free ternary rich words. Using&#10;the structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich&#10;words is $1 + 1/(3 &#45; mu) approx 2.25876324$, where $mu$ is the unique real&#10;root of the polynomial $x^3 &#45; 2x^2 &#45; 1$.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12068v1) |&#10;| Fitting Multilevel Factor Models | Tetiana Parshakova, Trevor Hastie, Stephen Boyd | &#160;&#160;We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance&#10;given by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~cite{parshakova2023factor}. We&#10;develop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation&#45;maximization (EM)&#10;algorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of&#10;the observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and&#10;maintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved&#10;through a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive&#10;definite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of an invertible PSD MLR matrix&#10;is also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the&#10;recursive Sherman&#45;Morrison&#45;Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of&#10;the inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky&#10;factorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities,&#10;yielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement. This paper is&#10;accompanied by an open&#45;source package that implements the proposed methods.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12067v1) |&#10;| Drifts of the sub&#45;stellar points of the TRAPPIST&#45;1 planets | Revol Alexandre, Émeline Bolmont, Mariana Sastre, Gabriel Tobie, Anne&#45;Sophie Libert, Mathilde Kervazo, Sergi Blanco&#45;Cuaresma | &#160;&#160;Accurate modeling of tidal interactions is crucial for interpreting recent&#10;JWST observations of the thermal emissions of TRAPPIST&#45;1~b and c and for&#10;characterizing the surface conditions and potential habitability of the other&#10;planets in the system. Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by&#10;tidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to&#10;their proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the&#10;TRAPPIST&#45;1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In&#10;this work, we present the recent implementation of the co&#45;planar tidal torque&#10;and forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N&#45;body code&#10;Posidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using&#10;a tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of&#10;each planet by taking into account their multi&#45;layer internal structure&#10;computed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST&#45;1 planets&#10;are not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state.&#10;Planet&#45;planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and&#10;tides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a&#10;result, the sub&#45;stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and&#10;long&#45;timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with&#10;periods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12065v1) |&#10;| Quantum Magic and Multi&#45;Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei | Florian Brökemeier, S. Momme Hengstenberg, James W. T. Keeble, Caroline E. P. Robin, Federico Rocco, Martin J. Savage | &#160;&#160;Motivated by the Gottesman&#45;Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the&#10;quantum complexity of $p$&#45;shell and $sd$&#45;shell nuclei. Valence&#45;space nuclear&#10;shell&#45;model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit&#10;registers using the Jordan&#45;Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$&#45;shell and 24&#10;qubits for the $sd$&#45;shell), from which measures of the many&#45;body entanglement&#10;($n$&#45;tangles) and magic (non&#45;stabilizerness) are determined. While exact&#10;evaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of&#10;active nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex&#10;nuclei. The broadly&#45;applicable Pauli&#45;String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe&#45;) MCMC technique&#10;is introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed&#10;nuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $sim 8$ for some&#10;nuclei. Significant multi&#45;nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$&#45;shell,&#10;dominated by proton&#45;neutron configurations, along with significant measures of&#10;magic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on&#10;the path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion.&#10;These results indicate that quantum&#45;computing resources will accelerate&#10;precision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12064v1) |&#10;| Post&#45;Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a&#10; &#160;massive, rotating object | Lorenzo Iorio | &#160;&#160;The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the&#10;general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense&#45;Thirring&#10;components of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are&#10;analytically worked out to the first post&#45;Newtonian level. To the Newtonian&#10;order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as&#10;well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation&#10;in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the&#10;primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first&#10;to &#39;Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system&#10;along an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred&#10;close to the Sun&#39;s flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due&#10;to the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of&#10;microarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for&#10;the post&#45;Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)&#10;spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of&#10;the latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current&#10;(formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would&#10;bring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the&#10;predicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not&#10;changed by any of the post&#45;&#45;Keplerian accelerations considered. The&#10;calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any&#10;alternative models of gravity as well.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12063v1) |&#10;| Generalized Robot Learning Framework | Jiahuan Yan, Zhouyang Hong, Yu Zhao, Yu Tian, Yunxin Liu, Travis Davies, Luhui Hu | &#160;&#160;Imitation based robot learning has recently gained significant attention in&#10;the robotics field due to its theoretical potential for transferability and&#10;generalizability. However, it remains notoriously costly, both in terms of&#10;hardware and data collection, and deploying it in real&#45;world environments&#10;demands meticulous setup of robots and precise experimental conditions. In this&#10;paper, we present a low&#45;cost robot learning framework that is both easily&#10;reproducible and transferable to various robots and environments. We&#10;demonstrate that deployable imitation learning can be successfully applied even&#10;to industrial&#45;grade robots, not just expensive collaborative robotic arms.&#10;Furthermore, our results show that multi&#45;task robot learning is achievable with&#10;simple network architectures and fewer demonstrations than previously thought&#10;necessary. As the current evaluating method is almost subjective when it comes&#10;to real&#45;world manipulation tasks, we propose Voting Positive Rate (VPR) &#45; a&#10;novel evaluation strategy that provides a more objective assessment of&#10;performance. We conduct an extensive comparison of success rates across various&#10;self&#45;designed tasks to validate our approach.

However, the prevailing notion of paraphrase is often quite&#10;simplistic, offering only a limited view of the vast spectrum of paraphrase&#10;phenomena. Indeed, we find that evaluating models in a paraphrase dataset can&#10;leave uncertainty about their true semantic understanding. To alleviate this,&#10;we release paraphrasus, a benchmark designed for multi&#45;dimensional assessment&#10;of paraphrase detection models and finer model selection. We find that&#10;paraphrase detection models under a fine&#45;grained evaluation lens exhibit&#10;trade&#45;offs that cannot be captured through a single classification dataset.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12060v1) |&#10;| Dual&#45;Layer Training and Decoding of Large Language Model with&#10; &#160;Simultaneously Thinking and Speaking | Ningyuan Xi, Xiaoyu Wang, Yetao Wu, Teng Chen, Qingqing Gu, Jinxian Qu, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong Chen, Luo Ji | &#160;&#160;Large Language Model can reasonably understand and generate human expressions&#10;but may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have&#10;been several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but&#10;most of them are not data&#45;driven or training&#45;based. In this paper, we are&#10;motivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel&#10;model architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts&#10;and then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines&#10;to annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt&#45;response samples, then&#10;add language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We&#10;train the language model by the thoughts&#45;augmented data and successfully let&#10;the thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally&#10;output more reasonable responses. Both qualitative examples and quantitative&#10;results validate the effectiveness and performance of TaS.

To address these&#10;concerns, recent research has focused on developing zero&#45;knowledge machine&#10;learning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of&#10;ML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have&#10;substantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily&#10;optimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the&#10;substantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the&#10;model and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new&#10;Commit&#45;and&#45;Prove SNARK (CP&#45;SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that&#10;effectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML&#10;pipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white&#45;box use of the&#10;underlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic&#10;polynomial commitment and only makes black&#45;box use of the proof system. As a&#10;result, Artemis is compatible with state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art proof systems without&#10;trusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP&#45;SNARKs, evaluate&#10;their performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial&#10;improvements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover&#10;costs and maintaining efficiency even for large&#45;scale models. For example, for&#10;the VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from&#10;11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML&#10;towards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and&#10;complex ML models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12055v1) |&#10;| MMP for Enriques pairs and singular Enriques varieties | Francesco Antonio Denisi, Ángel David Ríos Ortiz, Nikolaos Tsakanikas, Zhixin Xie | &#160;&#160;We introduce and study the class of primitive Enriques varieties, whose&#10;smooth members are Enriques manifolds. We provide several examples and we&#10;demonstrate that this class is stable under the operations of the Minimal Model&#10;Program (MMP). In particular, given an Enriques manifold $Y$ and an effective&#10;$mathbb{R}$&#45;divisor $B_Y$ on $Y$ such that the pair $(Y,B_Y)$ is log&#10;canonical, we prove that any $(K_Y+B_Y)$&#45;MMP terminates with a minimal model&#10;$(Y&#39;,B_{Y&#39;})$ of $(Y,B_Y)$, where $Y&#39;$ is a $mathbb{Q}$&#45;factorial primitive&#10;Enriques variety with canonical singularities.

Published codes focus on&#10;continuous rotations and unitary groups, which generally are not applicable to&#10;systems with strong crystal&#45;field effects. The PointGroupNRG code implements&#10;symmetries related to discrete rotation groups, which are defined by the user&#10;in terms of Clebsch&#45;Gordan coefficients, together with particle conservation&#10;and spin rotation symmetries. In this paper we present a new version of the&#10;code that extends the available finite groups, previously limited to simply&#10;reducible point groups, in a way that all point and double groups become&#10;accessible. It also includes the full spin&#45;orbital rotation group. Moreover, to&#10;improve the code&#39;s flexibility for impurities with complex interactions, this&#10;new version allows to choose between a standard Anderson Hamiltonian for the&#10;impurity or, as another novel feature, an ionic model that requires only the&#10;spectrum and the impurity Lehmann amplitudes.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12050v1) |&#10;| Quantum&#45;like nonlinear interferometry with frequency&#45;engineered&#10; &#160;classical light | Romain Dalidet, Anthony Martin, Grégory Sauder, Laurent Labonté, Sébastien Tanzilli | &#160;&#160;Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic&#10;entanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits. Nonlinear&#10;optics has served as a workhorse for the generation of entangled photon pairs,&#10;ensuring both energy and phase conservation, but at the cost of limited rate&#10;and degraded signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio compared to laser&#45;based interferometry&#10;approaches. We present a &quot;quantum&#45;like&quot; nonlinear optical method that reaches&#10;super&#45;resolution in single&#45;photon detection regime. This is achieved by&#10;replacing photon&#45;pairs by coherent states of light, mimicking quantum&#10;properties through classical nonlinear optics processes. Our scheme utilizes&#10;two high&#45;brightness lasers. This results in a substantially greater&#10;signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio compared to its quantum counterpart. Such an approach&#10;paves the way to significantly reduced acquisition times, providing a pathway&#10;to explore signals across a broader range of bandwidth. The need to increase&#10;the frequency bandwidth of the quantum sensor significantly motivates the&#10;potential applications of this pathway.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12049v1) |&#10;| A Survey&#45;Based Quantitative Analysis of Stress Factors and Their Impacts&#10; &#160;Among Cybersecurity Professionals | Sunil Arora, John D. Hastings | &#160;&#160;This study investigates the prevalence and underlying causes of work&#45;related&#10;stress and burnout among cybersecurity professionals using a quantitative&#10;survey approach guided by the Job Demands&#45;Resources model. Analysis of&#10;responses from 50 cybersecurity practitioners reveals an alarming reality: 44%&#10;report experiencing severe work&#45;related stress and burnout, while an additional&#10;28% are uncertain about their condition. The demanding nature of cybersecurity&#10;roles, unrealistic expectations, and unsupportive organizational cultures&#10;emerge as primary factors fueling this crisis. Notably, 66% of respondents&#10;perceive cybersecurity jobs as more stressful than other IT positions, with 84%&#10;facing additional challenges due to the pandemic and recent high&#45;profile&#10;breaches. The study finds that most cybersecurity experts are reluctant to&#10;report their struggles to management, perpetuating a cycle of silence and&#10;neglect. To address this critical issue, the paper recommends that&#10;organizations foster supportive work environments, implement mindfulness&#10;programs, and address systemic challenges. By prioritizing the mental health of&#10;cybersecurity professionals, organizations can cultivate a more resilient and&#10;effective workforce to protect against an ever&#45;evolving threat landscape.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12047v1) |&#10;| Using Large Language Models to Generate Clinical Trial Tables and&#10; &#160;Figures | Yumeng Yang, Peter Krusche, Kristyn Pantoja, Cheng Shi, Ethan Ludmir, Kirk Roberts, Gen Zhu | &#160;&#160;Tables, figures, and listings (TFLs) are essential tools for summarizing&#10;clinical trial data.

While most approaches in the Safe&#10;Reinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and&#10;robot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them&#10;in complex real&#45;world settings. Instead, model&#45;based approaches that&#10;incorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning&#10;framework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on&#10;the real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot&#10;dynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task&#45;specific and hard&#10;to obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to&#10;compute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long&#45;term safety&#10;requirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe&#10;exploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus&#10;on ensuring long&#45;term safety and handling of uncertainty. Our approach is&#10;competitive or superior to state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methods in final performance while&#10;maintaining safer behavior during training.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12045v1) |&#10;| Quasiperiodic Floquet&#45;Gibbs states in Rydberg atomic systems | Wilson S. Martins, Federico Carollo, Kay Brandner, Igor Lesanovsky | &#160;&#160;Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by&#10;fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an&#10;equilibrium&#45;like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet&#45;Magnus&#10;Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi&#39;s golden rule, we show&#10;that such Floquet&#45;Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated&#10;Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab&#45;frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function&#10;of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the&#10;system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which&#10;is necessary to uphold high&#45;lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To&#10;corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five&#10;interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate&#10;numerically that the second&#45;order Floquet&#45;Gibbs state of this system is&#10;essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding&#10;Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently&#10;large.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12044v1) |&#10;| Understanding the Effects of the Baidu&#45;ULTR Logging Policy on Two&#45;Tower&#10; &#160;Models | Morris de Haan, Philipp Hager | &#160;&#160;Despite the popularity of the two&#45;tower model for unbiased learning to rank&#10;(ULTR) tasks, recent work suggests that it suffers from a major limitation that&#10;could lead to its collapse in industry applications: the problem of logging&#10;policy confounding. Several potential solutions have even been proposed;&#10;however, the evaluation of these methods was mostly conducted using&#10;semi&#45;synthetic simulation experiments. This paper bridges the gap between&#10;theory and practice by investigating the confounding problem on the largest&#10;real&#45;world dataset, Baidu&#45;ULTR. Our main contributions are threefold: 1) we&#10;show that the conditions for the confounding problem are given on Baidu&#45;ULTR,&#10;2) the confounding problem bears no significant effect on the two&#45;tower model,&#10;and 3) we point to a potential mismatch between expert annotations, the golden&#10;standard in ULTR, and user click behavior.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12043v1) |&#10;| ASR Benchmarking: Need for a More Representative Conversational Dataset | Gaurav Maheshwari, Dmitry Ivanov, Théo Johannet, Kevin El Haddad | &#160;&#160;Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable&#10;performance on widely used benchmarks such as LibriSpeech and Fleurs. However,&#10;these benchmarks do not adequately reflect the complexities of real&#45;world&#10;conversational environments, where speech is often unstructured and contains&#10;disfluencies such as pauses, interruptions, and diverse accents. In this study,&#10;we introduce a multilingual conversational dataset, derived from TalkBank,&#10;consisting of unstructured phone conversation between adults. Our results show&#10;a significant performance drop across various state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art ASR models when&#10;tested in conversational settings. Furthermore, we observe a correlation&#10;between Word Error Rate and the presence of speech disfluencies, highlighting&#10;the critical need for more realistic, conversational ASR benchmarks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12042v1) |&#10;&#10;">

KhudaBukhsh | &#160;&#160;This paper makes three key contributions. First, via a substantial corpus of&#10;51,278 interview questions sourced from 888 YouTube videos of mock interviews&#10;of Indian civil service candidates, we demonstrate stark gender bias in the&#10;broad nature of questions asked to male and female candidates. Second, our&#10;experiments with large language models show a strong presence of gender bias in&#10;explanations provided by the LLMs on the gender inference task. Finally, we&#10;present a novel dataset of 51,278 interview questions that can inform future&#10;social science studies.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12194v3) |&#10;| DynaMo: In&#45;Domain Dynamics Pretraining for Visuo&#45;Motor Control | Zichen Jeff Cui, Hengkai Pan, Aadhithya Iyer, Siddhant Haldar, Lerrel Pinto | &#160;&#160;Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex&#10;visuomotor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to&#10;thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high&#45;dimensional visual&#10;observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual&#10;representations are predominantly either pretrained on out&#45;of&#45;domain data or&#10;trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present&#10;DynaMo, a new in&#45;domain, self&#45;supervised method for learning visual&#10;representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a&#10;latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of&#10;image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without&#10;augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.&#10;Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out&#45;of&#45;domain data such as Internet&#10;datasets or cross&#45;embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real&#10;environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly&#10;improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self&#45;supervised&#10;learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo&#10;hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,&#10;and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and&#10;measure its impact on downstream policy performance.

Qwen2&#45;VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,&#10;which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions&#10;into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to&#10;generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning&#10;with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary&#10;Position Embedding (M&#45;RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional&#10;information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for&#10;processing both images and videos, enhancing the model&#39;s visual perception&#10;capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2&#45;VL&#10;investigates the scaling laws for large vision&#45;language models (LVLMs). By&#10;scaling both the model size&#45;with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters&#45;and the&#10;amount of training data, the Qwen2&#45;VL Series achieves highly competitive&#10;performance. Notably, the Qwen2&#45;VL&#45;72B model achieves results comparable to&#10;leading models such as GPT&#45;4o and Claude3.5&#45;Sonnet across various multimodal&#10;benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models.

BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses&#10;and 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance&#10;of deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to&#10;integrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and&#10;performance. However, widely&#45;used C++&#45;based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,&#10;g$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries&#10;like PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of&#10;debugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we&#10;introduce an eager&#45;mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,&#10;providing PyTorch&#45;compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach&#10;includes GPU&#45;accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for&#10;2nd&#45;order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear&#10;solvers. Our eager&#45;mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency,&#10;achieving an average speedup of 18.5$times$, 22$times$, and 23$times$&#10;compared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12190v1) |&#10;| Massively Multi&#45;Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context | Felix B Mueller, Julian Tanke, Juergen Gall | &#160;&#160;Forecasting long&#45;term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of&#10;human behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input&#10;sequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby&#10;people can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene&#45;aware social&#10;transformer model (SAST) to forecast long&#45;term (10s) human motion motion.&#10;Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely&#10;varying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal&#10;convolutional encoder&#45;decoder architecture with a Transformer&#45;based bottleneck&#10;that allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model&#10;the conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We&#10;benchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to&#10;16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously.

Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon | &#160;&#160;Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a&#10;perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from&#10;fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($mu$&#45;distortion) to late&#45;time&#10;baryonic feedback processes (y&#45;distortion). While the y&#45;distortion can be&#10;detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the&#10;$Lambda$CDM&#45;predicted $mu$&#45;distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude&#10;smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a&#10;serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $mu$&#10;arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the&#10;primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k approx 1&#45;10^{4}$ Mpc$^{&#45;1}$. Here,&#10;we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly&#10;detecting $mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but&#10;with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we&#10;optimize the instrument&#39;s configuration to target $mu$ while robustly&#10;marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike&#10;Fourier&#45;transform&#45;spectrometer&#45;based designs, the specific bands and their&#10;individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing&#10;significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the&#10;$Lambda$CDM&#45;predicted $mu$&#45;distortion at $approx 5sigma$ (10$sigma$)&#10;assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission&#10;duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized&#10;configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1&#45;2000 GHz with degree&#45;scale angular&#10;resolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally&#10;measure the y&#45;distortion at sub&#45;percent precision and its relativistic&#10;correction at percent&#45;level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total&#10;thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12188v1) |&#10;| Exoplanet accretion monitoring spectroscopic survey (ENTROPY) I.&#10; &#160;Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary&#45;mass&#10; &#160;object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C.

Detection of emission lines from&#10;accreting gas giants facilitate detailed investigations into this process. This&#10;work presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known&#10;young, planetary&#45;mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf&#10;2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7&#45;21 Mj and age 5&#45;45 Myr, located at 45+&#45;2&#10;pc. We obtained the first high&#45;resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target&#10;with VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near&#45;UV to visible wavelengths (3200&#45;6800&#10;AA). We report resolved H3&#45;H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.&#10;Based on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+&#45;1&#10;km/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR&#10;excess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of&#10;the parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+&#45;63 K and radius to 1.5+&#45;0.1&#10;Rj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet&#45;surface shock model&#10;implies a pre&#45;shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,&#45;40) km/s and a pre&#45;shock&#10;density of log(n0/cm^&#45;3)=14(+0,&#45;5). Pre&#45;shock velocity points to a mass of&#10;6(+8,&#45;4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary&#10;Lline&#45;Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of&#10;1.4(+2.8,&#45;0.9)x10^&#45;8 Mj/yr.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12187v1) |&#10;| Qwen2.5&#45;Coder Technical Report | Binyuan Hui, Jian Yang, Zeyu Cui, Jiaxi Yang, Dayiheng Liu, Lei Zhang, Tianyu Liu, Jiajun Zhang, Bowen Yu, Kai Dang, An Yang, Rui Men, Fei Huang, Xingzhang Ren, Xuancheng Ren, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin | &#160;&#160;In this report, we introduce the Qwen2.5&#45;Coder series, a significant upgrade&#10;from its predecessor, CodeQwen1.5. This series includes two models:&#10;Qwen2.5&#45;Coder&#45;1.5B and Qwen2.5&#45;Coder&#45;7B. As a code&#45;specific model,&#10;Qwen2.5&#45;Coder is built upon the Qwen2.5 architecture and continues pretrained&#10;on a vast corpus of over 5.5 trillion tokens. Through meticulous data cleaning,&#10;scalable synthetic data generation, and balanced data mixing, Qwen2.5&#45;Coder&#10;demonstrates impressive code generation capabilities while retaining general&#10;versatility. The model has been evaluated on a wide range of code&#45;related&#10;tasks, achieving state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art (SOTA) performance across more than 10&#10;benchmarks, including code generation, completion, reasoning, and repair,&#10;consistently outperforming larger models of the same model size. We believe&#10;that the release of the Qwen2.5&#45;Coder series will not only push the boundaries&#10;of research in code intelligence but also, through its permissive licensing,&#10;encourage broader adoption by developers in real&#45;world applications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12186v1) |&#10;| Disruption of a massive molecular cloud by a supernova in the Galactic&#10; &#160;Centre: Initial results from the ACES project | M.

Xu | &#160;&#160;The Milky Way&#39;s Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our&#10;local solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions&#10;it exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong&#10;dynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).&#10;Consequently, it is likely that there are large&#45;scale physical structures&#10;within the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we&#10;present new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array&#10;(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a&#10;multi&#45;wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the&#10;M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring&#45;like morphology. We&#10;estimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring to be 79&quot;&#10;and 154&quot;, respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre&#10;distance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $&gt; 10^{4}$ cm$^{&#45;3}$, a&#10;mass of $sim$ $10^6$ M$_odot$, and an expansion speed of $sim$ 20 km&#10;s$^{&#45;1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($&gt; 10^{51}$ erg) and&#10;momentum ($&gt; 10^7$ M$_odot$ km s$^{&#45;1}$). We discuss several possible causes&#10;for the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback&#10;and large&#45;scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the&#10;M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring is a single high&#45;energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain&#10;the observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have&#10;taken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which&#10;we now see as the M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an&#10;extreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12185v1) |&#10;| To CoT or not to CoT?

But for what kinds of&#10;tasks is this extra ``thinking&#39;&#39; really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted&#10;a quantitative meta&#45;analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own&#10;evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives&#10;strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with&#10;much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the&#10;answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the&#10;question or model&#39;s response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic&#10;operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of&#10;CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing&#10;against tool&#45;augmented LLMs. Much of CoT&#39;s gain comes from improving symbolic&#10;execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our&#10;results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance&#10;while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond&#10;prompt&#45;based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation&#10;across the whole range of LLM applications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183v1) |&#10;| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs | Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T. Chiu, Siyu Ren, Fei Yuan, Wenting Zhao, Zhiyong Wu, Alexander M. Rush | &#160;&#160;Broad textual understanding and in&#45;context learning require language models&#10;that utilize full document contexts. Due to the implementation challenges&#10;associated with directly training long&#45;context models, many methods have been&#10;proposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to&#10;differences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these&#10;approaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long&#45;context&#10;performance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a&#10;controlled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation,&#10;utilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several&#10;insights into long&#45;context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of&#10;perplexity as a general&#45;purpose performance indicator even in longer&#45;context&#10;tasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods&#10;systematically underperform across long&#45;context tasks.

Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate&#10;information that conflicts with real&#45;world facts, and their persuasive style&#10;can make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result,&#10;end&#45;users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with&#10;the accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all&#10;outputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore&#10;supervised finetuning on uncertainty&#45;augmented predictions as a method to&#10;develop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty.&#10;Specifically, we measure the calibration of pre&#45;trained models and then&#10;fine&#45;tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of&#10;uncertainty. Through experiments on various question&#45;answering datasets, we&#10;demonstrate that LLMs are well&#45;calibrated in assessing their predictions, and&#10;supervised finetuning based on the model&#39;s own confidence leads to&#10;well&#45;calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single&#45;claim&#10;answers.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12180v1) |&#10;| Computational Dynamical Systems | Jordan Cotler, Semon Rezchikov | &#160;&#160;We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite&#45;dimensional&#10;dynamical systems. Building off of previous work, we give definitions for what&#10;it means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine. We then&#10;show that &#39;chaotic&#39; dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and&#10;&#39;integrable&#39; dynamical systems (more generally, measure&#45;preserving systems)&#10;cannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines can&#10;be robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, we&#10;show that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable&#10;one&#45;dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and&#10;moreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt.&#10;More broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one &#39;machine&#39; to simulate&#10;another, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low&#45;complexity &#39;encoders&#39; and&#10;&#39;decoders&#39; to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system&#10;being simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical&#10;system leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity&#10;theory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12179v1) |&#10;| Poisson approximate likelihood compared to the particle filter | Yize Hao, Aaron A. Abkemeier, Edward L. Ionides | &#160;&#160;Filtering algorithms are fundamental for inference on partially observed&#10;stochastic dynamic systems, since they provide access to the likelihood&#10;function and hence enable likelihood&#45;based or Bayesian inference. A novel&#10;Poisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.&#10;(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering&#10;a fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of&#10;partially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL&#10;is the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large&#10;improvement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,&#10;based on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.&#10;(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should&#10;use PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence&#10;also reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a&#10;shortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that&#10;the comparison of log&#45;likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al. (2023) is&#10;flawed because their PAL calculations were carried out using a dataset scaled&#10;differently from the previous study. If PAL and the particle filter are applied&#10;to the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears. On simulations&#10;where the model is correctly specified, the particle filter outperforms PAL.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12173v1) |&#10;| You Only Read Once (YORO): Learning to Internalize Database Knowledge&#10; &#160;for Text&#45;to&#45;SQL | Hideo Kobayashi, Wuwei Lan, Peng Shi, Shuaichen Chang, Jiang Guo, Henghui Zhu, Zhiguo Wang, Patrick Ng | &#160;&#160;While significant progress has been made on the text&#45;to&#45;SQL task, recent&#10;solutions repeatedly encode the same database schema for every question,&#10;resulting in unnecessary high inference cost and often overlooking crucial&#10;database knowledge. To address these issues, we propose You Only Read Once&#10;(YORO), a novel paradigm that directly internalizes database knowledge into the&#10;parametric knowledge of a text&#45;to&#45;SQL model during training and eliminates the&#10;need for schema encoding during inference. YORO significantly reduces the input&#10;token length by 66%&#45;98%. Despite its shorter inputs, our empirical results&#10;demonstrate YORO&#39;s competitive performances with traditional systems on three&#10;benchmarks as well as its significant outperformance on large databases.&#10;Furthermore, YORO excels in handling questions with challenging value&#10;retrievals such as abbreviation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12172v1) |&#10;| Ergodic properties of infinite extension of symmetric interval exchange&#10; &#160;transformations | Przemysław Berk, Frank Trujillo, Hao Wu | &#160;&#160;We prove that skew products with the cocycle given by the function&#10;$f(x)=a(x&#45;1/2)$ with $a&#10;eq 0$ are ergodic for every ergodic symmetric IET in&#10;the base, thus giving the full characterization of ergodic extensions in this&#10;family. Moreover, we prove that under an additional natural assumption of&#10;unique ergodicity on the IET, we can replace $f$ with any differentiable&#10;function with a non&#45;zero sum of jumps. Finally, by considering weakly mixing&#10;IETs instead of just ergodic, we show that the skew products with cocycle given&#10;by $f$ have infinite ergodic index.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12168v1) |&#10;| multiPI&#45;TransBTS: A Multi&#45;Path Learning Framework for Brain Tumor Image&#10; &#160;Segmentation Based on Multi&#45;Physical Information | Hongjun Zhu, Jiaohang Huang, Kuo Chen, Xuehui Ying, Ying Qian | &#160;&#160;Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis,&#10;treatment planning, and monitoring the progression of brain tumors. However,&#10;due to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across&#10;different MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In&#10;this study, we propose a novel Transformer&#45;based framework, multiPI&#45;TransBTS,&#10;which integrates multi&#45;physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.&#10;The model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi&#45;modal&#10;imaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor&#10;characteristics. The multiPI&#45;TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an&#10;Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi&#45;source, multi&#45;scale feature&#10;decoder. The encoder incorporates a multi&#45;branch architecture to separately&#10;extract modality&#45;specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module&#10;fuses information from multiple sources using channel&#45;wise and element&#45;wise&#10;attention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both&#10;common and task&#45;specific features through a Task&#45;Specific Feature Introduction&#10;(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),&#10;Tumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on&#10;the BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of&#10;multiPI&#45;TransBTS over the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methods. The model consistently&#10;achieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,&#10;highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results&#10;also indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision&#10;and recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a&#10;significant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving&#10;clinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12167v1) |&#10;| Synchrotron self&#45;Compton in a radiative&#45;adiabatic fireball scenario:&#10; &#160;Modelling the multiwavelength observations in some Fermi/LAT bursts | Nissim Fraija, P. Veres, B. Betancourt Kamenetskaia, A. Galvan&#45;Gamez, M. G. Dainotti, Simone Dichiara, R. L. Becerra | &#160;&#160;Energetic GeV photons expected from the closest and the most energetic&#10;Gamma&#45;ray bursts (GRBs) provide an unique opportunity to study the&#10;very&#45;high&#45;energy emission as well as the possible correlations with lower&#10;energy bands in realistic GRB afterglow models. In the standard GRB afterglow&#10;model, the relativistic homogeneous shock is usually considered to be fully&#10;adiabatic, however, it could be partially radiative. Based on the external&#10;forward&#45;shock scenario in both stellar wind and constant&#45;density medium. We&#10;present a radiative&#45;adiabatic analytical model of the synchrotron self&#45;Compton&#10;(SSC) and synchrotron processes considering an electron energy distribution&#10;with a power&#45;law index of 1 &lt; p &lt; 2 and 2 $&#10;eq$ p. We show that the SSC&#10;scenario plays a relevant role in the radiative parameter $epsilon$, leading&#10;to a prolonged evolution during the slow cooling regime. In a particular case,&#10;we derive the Fermi/LAT light curves together with the photons with energies&#10;$geq$ 100 MeV in a sample of nine bursts from the second Fermi/LAT GRB catalog&#10;that exhibited temporal and spectral indices with $geq$ 1.5 and $approx$ 2,&#10;respectively. These events can hardly be described with closure relations of&#10;the standard synchrotron afterglow model, and also exhibit energetic photons&#10;above the synchrotron limit. We have modeled the multi&#45;wavelength observations&#10;of our sample to constrain the microphysical parameters, the circumburst&#10;density, the bulk Lorentz factor and the mechanism responsible for explaining&#10;the energetic GeV photons.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12166v1) |&#10;| Blind Deconvolution on Graphs: Exact and Stable Recovery | Chang Ye, Gonzalo Mateos | &#160;&#160;We study a blind deconvolution problem on graphs, which arises in the context&#10;of localizing a few sources that diffuse over networks. While the observations&#10;are bilinear functions of the unknown graph filter coefficients and sparse&#10;input signals, a mild requirement on invertibility of the diffusion filter&#10;enables an efficient convex relaxation leading to a linear programming&#10;formulation that can be tackled with off&#45;the&#45;shelf solvers. Under the&#10;Bernoulli&#45;Gaussian model for the inputs, we derive sufficient exact recovery&#10;conditions in the noise&#45;free setting. A stable recovery result is then&#10;established, ensuring the estimation error remains manageable even when the&#10;observations are corrupted by a small amount of noise. Numerical tests with&#10;synthetic and real&#45;world network data illustrate the merits of the proposed&#10;algorithm, its robustness to noise as well as the benefits of leveraging&#10;multiple signals to aid the (blind) localization of sources of diffusion. At a&#10;fundamental level, the results presented here broaden the scope of classical&#10;blind deconvolution of (spatio&#45;)temporal signals to irregular graph domains.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12164v1) |&#10;| Generalized compression and compressive search of large datasets | Morgan E. Prior, Thomas Howard III, Emily Light, Najib Ishaq, Noah M. Daniels | &#160;&#160;The Big Data explosion has necessitated the development of search algorithms&#10;that scale sub&#45;linearly in time and memory.&#10; &#160;While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently,&#10;few algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain&#45;specific.&#10; &#160;We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to&#10;perform $k$&#45;NN and $&#13;ho$&#45;NN search on compressed data while only decompressing&#10;a small, relevant, portion of the data.&#10; &#160;panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low&#45;dimensional&#10;structure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.&#10; &#160;panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between&#10;two points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in&#10;terms of the other.&#10; &#160;This property holds for many widely&#45;used distance functions, e.g. string edit&#10;distances (Levenshtein, Needleman&#45;Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures&#10;(Jaccard, Dice, etc.).&#10; &#160;We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic,&#10;and set data.&#10; &#160;We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the&#10;compressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.&#10; &#160;panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering&#10;sub&#45;linear time performance for $k$&#45;NN and $&#13;ho$&#45;NN search.&#10; &#160;We conclude that panCAKES is an efficient, general&#45;purpose algorithm for&#10;exact compressive search on large datasets that obey the manifold hypothesis.&#10; &#160;We provide an open&#45;source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming&#10;language.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12161v1) |&#10;| WeHelp: A Shared Autonomy System for Wheelchair Users | Abulikemu Abuduweili, Alice Wu, Tianhao Wei, Weiye Zhao | &#160;&#160;There is a large population of wheelchair users. Most of the wheelchair users&#10;need help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs&#10;are not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this&#10;project, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair&#10;users. A robot with a WeHelp system has three modes, following mode, remote&#10;control mode and tele&#45;operation mode. In the following mode, the robot follows&#10;the wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can&#10;ask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the&#10;wheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech&#10;recognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode.&#10;In the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy&#10;stick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs,&#10;such as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high&#10;shelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant&#10;takes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks&#10;for their needs. Our evaluation shows that the pipeline is useful and practical&#10;for wheelchair users.

These IFSs&#10;exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are&#10;topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the&#10;Blonder&#45;Tinkham&#45;Klapwijk formalism and considering normal&#45;$d$&#45;wave&#10;superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients&#10;including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and&#10;examine the validation of Widemann&#45;Franz law in the presence of both voltage&#10;and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of&#10;$d$&#45;wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the&#10;normal&#45;superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric&#10;response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in&#10;Seebeck coefficient ($sim 200,mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($sim 3.5$) due to the&#10;generation of the IFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for&#10;device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by&#10;computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice&#45;regularized&#10;version of our continuum model.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12157v1) |&#10;| JEAN: Joint Expression and Audio&#45;guided NeRF&#45;based Talking Face&#10; &#160;Generation | Sai Tanmay Reddy Chakkera, Aggelina Chatziagapi, Dimitris Samaras | &#160;&#160;We introduce a novel method for joint expression and audio&#45;guided talking&#10;face generation. Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker&#10;identity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these&#10;challenges, we propose a NeRF&#45;based network. Since we train our network on&#10;monocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn&#10;disentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio&#10;features in a self&#45;supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects.&#10;By incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned&#10;audio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle&#10;motion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer&#45;based architecture&#10;that learns expression features, capturing long&#45;range facial expressions and&#10;disentangling them from the speech&#45;specific mouth movements. Through&#10;quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can&#10;synthesize high&#45;fidelity talking face videos, achieving state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art facial&#10;expression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12156v1) |&#10;| Autopet III challenge: Incorporating anatomical knowledge into nnUNet&#10; &#160;for lesion segmentation in PET/CT | Hamza Kalisch, Fabian Hörst, Ken Herrmann, Jens Kleesiek, Constantin Seibold | &#160;&#160;Lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging is essential for precise tumor&#10;characterization, which supports personalized treatment planning and enhances&#10;diagnostic precision in oncology. However, accurate manual segmentation of&#10;lesions is time&#45;consuming and prone to inter&#45;observer variability. Given the&#10;rising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods,&#10;particularly deep&#45;learning&#45;based approaches, have become increasingly more&#10;relevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation&#10;of tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting,&#10;addressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable&#10;solutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET&#10;challenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers&#10;(FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers. To this extent, we developed a&#10;classifier that identifies the tracer of the given PET/CT based on the Maximum&#10;Intensity Projection of the PET scan. We trained two individual&#10;nnUNet&#45;ensembles for each tracer where anatomical labels are included as a&#10;multi&#45;label task to enhance the model&#39;s performance. Our final submission&#10;achieves cross&#45;validation Dice scores of 76.90% and 61.33% for the publicly&#10;available FDG and PSMA datasets, respectively.

However, a&#10;robot&#39;s ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if&#10;naively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach&#45;avoid&#10;dynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a&#10;safety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human&#39;s behavior&#10;as goal&#45;driven but conditioned on the robot&#39;s plan, enabling us to capture&#10;influence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical&#10;and belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in&#10;human behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE&#10;(Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high&#45;dimensional&#10;(39&#45;D) simulated human&#45;robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline&#10;game&#45;theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust&#10;baseline that treats the human as a worst&#45;case adversary, a safety controller&#10;that does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy&#45;function&#45;based&#10;safety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage&#10;the influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing&#10;the robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate&#10;during task execution.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12153v1) |&#10;| Decoding Style: Efficient Fine&#45;Tuning of LLMs for Image&#45;Guided Outfit&#10; &#160;Recommendation with Preference | Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan | &#160;&#160;Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding&#10;both fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper&#10;presents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large&#10;language models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their &quot;black box&quot; and static&#10;nature through fine&#45;tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item&#10;visual&#45;textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a&#10;Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style&#10;and color characteristics from human&#45;curated fashion images, forming the basis&#10;for personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine&#45;tuned on the&#10;open&#45;source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability&#10;to recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative&#10;examples is employed to enhance the LLM&#39;s decision&#45;making process. This creates&#10;a self&#45;enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in&#10;line with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore&#10;dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill&#45;in&#45;the&#45;blank,&#10;and complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework&#39;s&#10;ability to generate stylish, trend&#45;aligned outfit suggestions, continuously&#10;improving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our&#10;proposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more&#10;cohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the&#10;proposed framework&#39;s potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate&#10;suggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit&#10;generation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12150v1) |&#10;| Mechanical Wannier&#45;Stark Ladder of Diamond Spin&#45;Mechanical Lamb Wave&#10; &#160;Resonators | Philip Andrango, Hailin Wang | &#160;&#160;We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier&#45;Stark ladders of&#10;diamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with&#10;ultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin&#10;properties. Three nearest&#45;neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric&#10;configurations and a large range of coupling rates have been explored for the&#10;realization of Wannier&#45;Stark ladders of LWRs, potentially enabling long&#45;range&#10;connectivity between spin qubits through their interactions with mechanical&#10;vibrations. Additional analysis on the effects of disorder indicates that the&#10;proposed Wannier&#45;Stark ladder can be robust against realistic experimental&#10;imperfections.

While these improve performance, they often reach a&#10;saturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM&#45;generated&#10;feedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key&#10;challenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can&#10;over&#45;correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and&#10;address errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self&#45;correct and struggle to&#10;identify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding&#10;how many iterations of refinement are needed is non&#45;trivial, and stopping too&#10;soon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose&#10;MAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty&#10;as easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse&#45;grained aggregation and hard&#10;ones with fine&#45;grained and iterative multi&#45;agent refinement. To improve error&#10;localization, we incorporate external step&#45;wise reward model (RM) scores.&#10;Moreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi&#45;agent loop with&#10;three agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on&#10;step&#45;wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure&#10;sufficient refinement, we re&#45;evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating&#10;further rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama&#45;3&#45;8B and GPT&#45;3.5&#10;and show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of&#10;MAgICoRe beats Self&#45;Consistency by 3.4%, Best&#45;of&#45;k by 3.2%, and Self&#45;Refine by&#10;4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with&#10;baselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our&#10;ablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe&#39;s RMs and multi&#45;agent&#10;communication.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147v1) |&#10;| Lempel&#45;Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka | &#160;&#160;Lempel&#45;Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string&#10;processing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into&#10;blocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence&#10;of a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another&#10;occurrence earlier in $T$. Due to numerous applications, LZ77 factorization is&#10;one of the most studied problems on strings. In the 47 years since its&#10;inception, several algorithms were developed for different models of&#10;computation, including parallel, GPU, external&#45;memory, and quantum. Remarkably,&#10;however, the complexity of the most basic variant is still not settled: All&#10;existing algorithms in the RAM model run in $Omega(n)$ time, which is a&#10;$Theta(&#10;og n)$ factor away from the lower bound of $Omega(n/&#10;og n)$&#10;(following from the necessity to read the input, which takes $Theta(n/&#10;og n)$&#10;space for $Tin{0,1}^{n}$).&#10; &#160;We present the first $o(n)$&#45;time algorithm for LZ77 factorization, breaking&#10;the linear&#45;time barrier present for nearly 50 years. For $Tin{0,1}^{n}$, our&#10;algorithm runs in $mathcal{O}(n/sqrt{&#10;og n})=o(n)$ time and uses the optimal&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og n)$ working space. Our algorithm generalizes to&#10;$Sigma=[0..sigma)$, where $sigma=n^{mathcal{O}(1)}$. The runtime and&#10;working space then become $mathcal{O}((n&#10;ogsigma)/sqrt{&#10;og n})$ and&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og_{sigma} n)$. To obtain our algorithm, we prove a more&#10;general result: For any constant $epsilonin(0,1)$ and $Tin[0..sigma)^{n}$,&#10;in $mathcal{O}((n&#10;ogsigma)/sqrt{&#10;og n})$ time and using&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og_{sigma}n)$ space, we can construct an&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og_{sigma}n)$&#45;size index that, given any $P=T[j..j+ell)$&#10;(represented as $(j,ell)$), computes the leftmost occurrence of $P$ in $T$ in&#10;$mathcal{O}(&#10;og^{epsilon}n)$ time. In other words, we solve the&#10;indexing/online variant of the LZ77 problem.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12146v1) |&#10;| Experimental Evidence That Conversational Artificial Intelligence Can&#10; &#160;Steer Consumer Behavior Without Detection | Tobias Werner, Ivan Soraperra, Emilio Calvano, David C. Parkes, Iyad Rahwan | &#160;&#160;Conversational AI models are becoming increasingly popular and are about to&#10;replace traditional search engines for information retrieval and product&#10;discovery. This raises concerns about monetization strategies and the potential&#10;for subtle consumer manipulation. Companies may have financial incentives to&#10;steer users toward search results or products in a conversation in ways that&#10;are unnoticeable to consumers. Using a behavioral experiment, we show that&#10;conversational AI models can indeed significantly shift consumer preferences.&#10;We discuss implications and ask whether regulators are sufficiently prepared to&#10;combat potential consumer deception.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12143v1) |&#10;| Investigating the effects of precise mass measurements of Ru and Pd&#10; &#160;isotopes on machine learning mass modeling | W.

Varriano | &#160;&#160;Atomic masses are a foundational quantity in our understanding of nuclear&#10;structure, astrophysics and fundamental symmetries. The long&#45;standing goal of&#10;creating a predictive global model for the binding energy of a nucleus remains&#10;a significant challenge, however, and prompts the need for precise measurements&#10;of atomic masses to serve as anchor points for model developments. We present&#10;precise mass measurements of neutron&#45;rich Ru and Pd isotopes performed at the&#10;Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade facility at Argonne National&#10;Laboratory using the Canadian Penning Trap mass spectrometer. The masses of&#10;$^{108}$Ru, $^{110}$Ru and $^{116}$Pd were measured to a relative mass&#10;precision $delta m/m approx 10^{&#45;8}$ via the phase&#45;imaging&#10;ion&#45;cyclotron&#45;resonance technique, and represent an improvement of&#10;approximately an order of magnitude over previous measurements. These mass data&#10;were used in conjunction with the physically interpretable machine learning&#10;(PIML) model, which uses a mixture density neural network to model mass&#10;excesses via a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The effects of our new mass&#10;data on a Bayesian&#45;updating of a PIML model are presented.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12141v1) |&#10;| MoRAG &#45;&#45; Multi&#45;Fusion Retrieval Augmented Generation for Human Motion | Kalakonda Sai Shashank, Shubh Maheshwari, Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla | &#160;&#160;We introduce MoRAG, a novel multi&#45;part fusion based retrieval&#45;augmented&#10;generation strategy for text&#45;based human motion generation. The method enhances&#10;motion diffusion models by leveraging additional knowledge obtained through an&#10;improved motion retrieval process. By effectively prompting large language&#10;models (LLMs), we address spelling errors and rephrasing issues in motion&#10;retrieval. Our approach utilizes a multi&#45;part retrieval strategy to improve the&#10;generalizability of motion retrieval across the language space. We create&#10;diverse samples through the spatial composition of the retrieved motions.&#10;Furthermore, by utilizing low&#45;level, part&#45;specific motion information, we can&#10;construct motion samples for unseen text descriptions. Our experiments&#10;demonstrate that our framework can serve as a plug&#45;and&#45;play module, improving&#10;the performance of motion diffusion models.

In this&#10;report, we introduce Takin AudioLLM, a series of techniques and models, mainly&#10;including Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, specifically designed for&#10;audiobook production. These models are capable of zero&#45;shot speech production,&#10;generating high&#45;quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human&#10;speech and facilitating individuals to customize the speech content according&#10;to their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec&#10;language model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a&#10;multi&#45;task training framework, capable of generating high&#45;fidelity natural&#10;speech in a zero&#45;shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and&#10;timbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while&#10;advocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its&#10;naturalness and expressiveness. Last, we propose the Takin Morphing system with&#10;highly decoupled and advanced timbre and prosody modeling approaches, which&#10;enables individuals to customize speech production with their preferred timbre&#10;and prosody in a precise and controllable manner. Extensive experiments&#10;validate the effectiveness and robustness of our Takin AudioLLM series models.&#10;For detailed demos, please refer to https://takinaudiollm.github.io.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12139v1) |&#10;| GRIN: GRadient&#45;INformed MoE | Liyuan Liu, Young Jin Kim, Shuohang Wang, Chen Liang, Yelong Shen, Hao Cheng, Xiaodong Liu, Masahiro Tanaka, Xiaoxia Wu, Wenxiang Hu, Vishrav Chaudhary, Zeqi Lin, Chenruidong Zhang, Jilong Xue, Hany Awadalla, Jianfeng Gao, Weizhu Chen | &#160;&#160;Mixture&#45;of&#45;Experts (MoE) models scale more effectively than dense models due&#10;to sparse computation through expert routing, selectively activating only a&#10;small subset of expert modules. However, sparse computation challenges&#10;traditional training practices, as discrete expert routing hinders standard&#10;backpropagation and thus gradient&#45;based optimization, which are the cornerstone&#10;of deep learning. To better pursue the scaling power of MoE, we introduce GRIN&#10;(GRadient&#45;INformed MoE training), which incorporates sparse gradient estimation&#10;for expert routing and configures model parallelism to avoid token dropping.&#10;Applying GRIN to autoregressive language modeling, we develop a top&#45;2&#10;16$times$3.8B MoE model. Our model, with only 6.6B activated parameters,&#10;outperforms a 7B dense model and matches the performance of a 14B dense model&#10;trained on the same data. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks&#10;demonstrate the potential of GRIN to significantly enhance MoE efficacy,&#10;achieving 79.4 on MMLU, 83.7 on HellaSwag, 74.4 on HumanEval, and 58.9 on MATH.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12136v1) |&#10;| BERT&#45;VBD: Vietnamese Multi&#45;Document Summarization Framework | Tuan&#45;Cuong Vuong, Trang Mai Xuan, Thien Van Luong | &#160;&#160;In tackling the challenge of Multi&#45;Document Summarization (MDS), numerous&#10;methods have been proposed, spanning both extractive and abstractive&#10;summarization techniques. However, each approach has its own limitations,&#10;making it less effective to rely solely on either one. An emerging and&#10;promising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractive&#10;summarization methods. Despite the plethora of studies in this domain, research&#10;on the combined methodology remains scarce, particularly in the context of&#10;Vietnamese language processing. This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDS&#10;framework leveraging a two&#45;component pipeline architecture that integrates&#10;extractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs an&#10;extractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This is&#10;achieved by a modification of the pre&#45;trained BERT network, which derives&#10;semantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet network&#10;structures. The second component utilizes the VBD&#45;LLaMA2&#45;7B&#45;50b model for&#10;abstractive summarization, ultimately generating the final summary document.&#10;Our proposed framework demonstrates a positive performance, attaining ROUGE&#45;2&#10;scores of 39.6% on the VN&#45;MDS dataset and outperforming the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art&#10;baselines.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12134v1) |&#10;| Einstein&#45;dilaton&#45;four&#45;Maxwell Holographic Anisotropic Models | Irina Ya. Aref&#39;eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov | &#160;&#160;In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the&#10;five&#45;dimensional Einstein&#45;dilaton&#45;Maxwell models has played a crucial role.&#10;Typically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while&#10;additional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A&#10;more general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field&#10;represents spatial longitudinal&#45;transverse anisotropy, while the third and&#10;fourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We&#10;consider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero&#10;temperature and five functions at non&#45;zero temperature. Maxwell field related&#10;to the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,&#10;whereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.&#10;We demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of&#10;the seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations &#45;&#45; either the&#10;dilaton or the vector potential equation &#45;&#45; follows from the Einstein equations&#10;and the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi&#10;identity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress&#45;energy&#10;tensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is&#10;provided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to&#10;three Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis&#10;shows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein&#10;equations and the equation for the vector potential&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12131v1) |&#10;| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components&#10; &#160;for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco&#45;Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram | &#160;&#160;Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data&#10;together with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal&#10;components used. It is therefore important to determine the number of&#10;significant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a&#10;variational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for&#10;estimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of&#10;samples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This&#10;eliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of&#10;principal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.&#10;This framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows&#10;and columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),&#10;and with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data&#10;with arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as&#10;cultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our&#10;method on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may&#10;underestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the&#10;synthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical&#10;dataset. These results suggest that it is broadly applicable across the life&#10;sciences.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12129v1) |&#10;| Linguini: A benchmark for language&#45;agnostic linguistic reasoning | Eduardo Sánchez, Belen Alastruey, Christophe Ropers, Pontus Stenetorp, Mikel Artetxe, Marta R.

The test&#10;covers 894 questions grouped in 160 problems across 75 (mostly) extremely&#10;low&#45;resource languages, extracted from the International Linguistic Olympiad&#10;corpus. To attain high accuracy on this benchmark, models don&#39;t need previous&#10;knowledge of the tested language, as all the information needed to solve the&#10;linguistic puzzle is presented in the context. We find that, while all analyzed&#10;models rank below 25% accuracy, there is a significant gap between open and&#10;closed models, with the best&#45;performing proprietary model at 24.05% and the&#10;best&#45;performing open model at 8.84%.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12126v1) |&#10;| From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the&#10; &#160;primordial black hole reheating scenario | Guillem Domènech, Jan Tränkle | &#160;&#160;We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs&#10;originate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight&#10;PBHs with masses $M&#10;esssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat&#10;it via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate&#10;whether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH&#10;reheating contains information about the pre&#45;PBH&#45;dominated stage, namely the&#10;initial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer&#10;functions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and&#10;isocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation&#10;of state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH&#10;dominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the&#10;spectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive&#10;to $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density&#10;fluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance&#10;as a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)&#10;observations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the&#10;initial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we&#10;find that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several&#10;future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas,&#10;especially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any&#10;early matter&#45;dominated universe scenario.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12125v1) |&#10;| Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules | Anqi Zhang, Wilson S. Geisler | &#160;&#160;Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We&#10;investigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented&#10;displays having well&#45;separated potential target&#45;object locations. Performance&#10;was compared with the Bayesian&#45;optimal decision process under the assumption&#10;that the information from the different potential target locations is&#10;statistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than&#10;optimal, despite humans&#39; substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the&#10;implausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show&#10;that three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical&#10;results. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near&#10;optimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the&#10;central potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise&#10;causes search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These&#10;findings have far&#45;reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks&#10;and other identification tasks in humans and other animals.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12124v1) |&#10;| Far&#45;from&#45;equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann&#10; &#160;approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows&#10; &#160;$v_n$ | Vincenzo Nugara, Vincenzo Greco, Salvatore Plumari | &#160;&#160;We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal&#10;system in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution&#10;function and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system&#10;sizes $R$ and interaction strength $eta/s$ and identify universality classes&#10;based upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each&#10;of this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $hat&#10;gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results&#10;highlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum&#10;moments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to&#10;a 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of&#10;different sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a&#10;similar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse&#10;flow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system&#10;size and $eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and&#10;their response functions, along with the impact of the $eta/s$ and the system&#10;transverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in&#10;momentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow&#10;$v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of&#10;large opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems&#10;evolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play&#10;in this process.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12123v1) |&#10;| Qwen2.5&#45;Math Technical Report: Toward Mathematical Expert Model via&#10; &#160;Self&#45;Improvement | An Yang, Beichen Zhang, Binyuan Hui, Bofei Gao, Bowen Yu, Chengpeng Li, Dayiheng Liu, Jianhong Tu, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin, Keming Lu, Mingfeng Xue, Runji Lin, Tianyu Liu, Xingzhang Ren, Zhenru Zhang | &#160;&#160;In this report, we present a series of math&#45;specific large language models:&#10;Qwen2.5&#45;Math and Qwen2.5&#45;Math&#45;Instruct&#45;1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the&#10;Qwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self&#45;improvement&#10;throughout the entire pipeline, from pre&#45;training and post&#45;training to&#10;inference: (1) During the pre&#45;training phase, Qwen2&#45;Math&#45;Instruct is utilized&#10;to generate large&#45;scale, high&#45;quality mathematical data. (2) In the&#10;post&#45;training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive&#10;sampling from Qwen2&#45;Math&#45;Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative&#10;evolution of data in supervised fine&#45;tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model,&#10;it&#39;s possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the&#10;next round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the&#10;ultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5&#45;Math&#45;Instruct.&#10;(3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling,&#10;optimizing the model&#39;s performance.&#10; &#160;Qwen2.5&#45;Math&#45;Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced&#10;mathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain&#45;of&#45;Thought (CoT) and&#10;Tool&#45;Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics&#10;datasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and&#10;AIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math&#10;competition problems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12122v1) |&#10;| Computing the $mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two&#45;Dimensional&#10; &#160;Strongly&#45;Correlated Systems | Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn | &#160;&#160;We show that the two&#45;dimensional $mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time&#45;reversal&#10;invariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary&#45;condition&#10;dependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non&#45;interacting and&#10;strongly&#45;correlated insulators. By introducing a family of quasi&#45;single&#10;particle states associated to the many&#45;body ground state of an insulator, we&#10;show that the $mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant can be expressed as the integral of a&#10;certain Berry connection over half the space of boundary conditions, providing&#10;an alternative expression to the formulations that appear in [Lee et al., Phys.&#10;Rev. Lett. $textbf{100}$, 186807 (2008)]. We show the equivalence of the&#10;different many&#45;body formulations of the invariant, and show how they reduce to&#10;known band&#45;theoretic results for Slater determinant ground states. Finally, we&#10;apply our results to analytically calculate the invariant for the Kane&#45;Mele&#10;model with nonlocal (orbital) Hatsugai&#45;Kohmoto (HK) interactions. This&#10;rigorously establishes the topological nontriviality of the Kane&#45;Mele model&#10;with HK interactions, and represents one of the few exact calculations of the&#10;$mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a strongly&#45;interacting system.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12120v1) |&#10;| Weak Lensing analysis of Abell 2390 using short exposures | A. Dutta, J. R. Peterson, T. Rose, M. Cianfaglione, A. Bonafede, G. Li, G. Sembroski | &#160;&#160;We present a weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 2390 at z =&#10;0.23 using second moment shape measurements made in 411 short 60s exposures.&#10;The exposures are obtained in three broadband photometric filters (g, r, i)&#10;using WIYN&#45;ODI. Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a&#10;moment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching&#10;algorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The&#10;measurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight&#10;to obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim&#10;simulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find&#10;the mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We&#10;also find the E&#45;Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic&#10;structures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical&#10;and X&#45;Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to&#10;map large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of&#10;the cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the&#10;peaks are similar to X&#45;Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster&#10;and show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12119v1) |&#10;| Low Frame&#45;rate Speech Codec: a Codec Designed for Fast High&#45;quality&#10; &#160;Speech LLM Training and Inference | Edresson Casanova, Ryan Langman, Paarth Neekhara, Shehzeen Hussain, Jason Li, Subhankar Ghosh, Ante Jukić, Sang&#45;gil Lee | &#160;&#160;Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing&#10;through audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the&#10;application of language modeling techniques to audio data. However, audio&#10;codecs often operate at high frame rates, resulting in slow training and&#10;inference, especially for autoregressive models. To address this challenge, we&#10;present the Low Frame&#45;rate Speech Codec (LFSC): a neural audio codec that&#10;leverages finite scalar quantization and adversarial training with large speech&#10;language models to achieve high&#45;quality audio compression with a 1.89 kbps&#10;bitrate and 21.5 frames per second.

Kothari | &#160;&#160;Machine Learning (ML) research has increased substantially in recent years,&#10;due to the success of predictive modeling across diverse application domains.&#10;However, well&#45;known barriers exist when attempting to deploy ML models in&#10;high&#45;stakes, clinical settings, including lack of model transparency (or the&#10;inability to audit the inference process), large training data requirements&#10;with siloed data sources, and complicated metrics for measuring model utility.&#10;In this work, we show empirically that including stronger baseline models in&#10;healthcare ML evaluations has important downstream effects that aid&#10;practitioners in addressing these challenges. Through a series of case studies,&#10;we find that the common practice of omitting baselines or comparing against a&#10;weak baseline model (e.g. a linear model with no optimization) obscures the&#10;value of ML methods proposed in the research literature. Using these insights,&#10;we propose some best practices that will enable practitioners to more&#10;effectively study and deploy ML models in clinical settings.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12116v1) |&#10;| Revisiting Dark Photon Constraints from CMB Spectral Distortions | Jens Chluba, Bryce Cyr, Matthew C. Johnson | &#160;&#160;Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide&#10;stringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post&#45;BBN (Big&#10;Bang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models&#10;with COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.&#10;Here, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark&#10;photon conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous&#10;works only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the&#10;change to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon&#10;distortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the&#10;distortion has an opposite sign and a $simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We&#10;furthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover&#10;the redshift range $simeq 2times 10^6&#45;4times 10^7$ between the $mu$&#45;era and&#10;the end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints&#10;for dark photon masses in the range $10^{&#45;4},{&#13;m eV}&#10;esssim m_{&#13;m&#10;dp}&#10;esssim 10^{&#45;3},{&#13;m eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We&#10;demonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon&#10;to dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $mu$&#45;type distortion&#10;independent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study&#10;dark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with&#10;CMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12115v1) |&#10;| Bi&#45;objective trail&#45;planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous&#10; &#160;environment | Cory M. Simon, Jeffrey Richley, Lucas Overbey, Darleen Perez&#45;Lavin | &#160;&#160;Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in&#10;resource delivery, patrolling, information&#45;gathering, agriculture, forest fire&#10;fighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and&#10;search&#45;and&#45;rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments &#45;&#45; with e.g.&#10;rough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or&#10;capturing robots &#45;&#45; should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of&#10;risks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should&#10;take the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the&#10;team&#45;level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward&#10;from visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider&#10;bi&#45;objective trail&#45;planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a&#10;hazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed&#10;graph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of&#10;survival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a&#10;robot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for&#10;the Pareto&#45;optimal robot&#45;team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team&#10;objectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive&#10;the mission. A human decision&#45;maker can then select trail plans that balance,&#10;according to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony&#10;optimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto&#45;optimal set of&#10;robot team trail plans. As a case study, we illustrate with an&#10;information&#45;gathering mission in an art museum.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12114v1) |&#10;| Pareto Data Framework: Steps Towards Resource&#45;Efficient Decision Making&#10; &#160;Using Minimum Viable Data (MVD) | Tashfain Ahmed, Josh Siegel | &#160;&#160;This paper introduces the Pareto Data Framework, an approach for identifying&#10;and selecting the Minimum Viable Data (MVD) required for enabling machine&#10;learning applications on constrained platforms such as embedded systems, mobile&#10;devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We demonstrate that strategic&#10;data reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing&#10;bandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies&#10;Minimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource&#45;constrained&#10;environments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient&#10;practices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and&#10;overprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for&#10;optimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data&#10;representation. An experimental methodology demonstrates effective acoustic&#10;data characterization after downsampling, quantization, and truncation to&#10;simulate reduced&#45;fidelity sensors and network and storage constraints; results&#10;shows that performance can be maintained up to 95% with sample rates reduced&#10;by 75% and bit depths and clip length reduced by 50% which translates into&#10;substantial cost and resource reduction. These findings have implications on&#10;the design and development of constrained systems. The paper also discusses&#10;broader implications of the framework, including the potential to democratize&#10;advanced AI technologies across IoT applications and sectors such as&#10;agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing to improve access and multiply&#10;the benefits of data&#45;driven insights.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12112v1) |&#10;| Applications of Knowledge Distillation in Remote Sensing: A Survey | Yassine Himeur, Nour Aburaed, Omar Elharrouss, Iraklis Varlamis, Shadi Atalla, Wathiq Mansoor, Hussain Al Ahmad | &#160;&#160;With the ever&#45;growing complexity of models in the field of remote sensing&#10;(RS), there is an increasing demand for solutions that balance model accuracy&#10;with computational efficiency. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a&#10;powerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,&#10;complex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in&#10;performance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and&#10;its innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer&#10;knowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact&#10;and efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application&#10;across various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and&#10;historical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are&#10;highlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational&#10;efficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical&#10;deployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of&#10;KD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the&#10;breadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case&#10;studies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,&#10;such as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review&#10;discusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical&#10;constraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive&#10;overview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS. Through this&#10;organization, the paper not only elucidates the current state of research in KD&#10;but also sets the stage for future research opportunities, thereby contributing&#10;significantly to both academic research and real&#45;world applications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12111v1) |&#10;| It depends: Varieties of defining growth dependence | Anja Janischewski, Katharina Bohnenberger, Matthias Kranke, Tobias Vogel, Riwan Driouich, Tobias Froese, Stefanie Gerold, Raphael Kaufmann, Lorenz Keyßer, Jannis Niethammer, Christopher Olk, Matthias Schmelzer, Aslı Yürük, Steffen Lange | &#160;&#160;Many socio&#45;economic systems require positive economic growth rates to&#10;function properly. Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing&#10;evidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,&#10;these growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,&#10;more and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth&#45;dependent systems&#10;and develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of&#10;&#39;growth dependence&#39; still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,&#10;which impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article&#10;proposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the&#10;concept of &#39;growth dependence&#39; across socio&#45;economic systems. We provide a&#10;general definition consisting of four components that can be specified for&#10;different empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of&#10;measurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions&#10;or properties of the system under investigation. According to our general&#10;definition, a socio&#45;economic system is growth&#45;dependent if it requires a&#10;long&#45;term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to&#10;maintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen&#10;normative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to&#10;three areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:&#10;employment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies&#10;demonstrate that whether or not a system is growth&#45;dependent hinges not only on&#10;the empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of&#10;the concept of growth dependence. Our framework enables coherent, robust and&#10;effective definitions and research questions, fostering comparability of&#10;findings across different cases and disciplines.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12109v1) |&#10;| SPRMamba: Surgical Phase Recognition for Endoscopic Submucosal&#10; &#160;Dissection with Mamba | Xiangning Zhang, Jinnan Chen, Qingwei Zhang, Chengfeng Zhou, Zhengjie Zhang, Xiaobo Li, Dahong Qian | &#160;&#160;Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive procedure&#10;initially designed for the treatment of early gastric cancer but is now widely&#10;used for various gastrointestinal lesions. Computer&#45;assisted Surgery systems&#10;have played a crucial role in improving the precision and safety of ESD&#10;procedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognition&#10;of surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesion&#10;characteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real&#45;time&#10;surgical phase recognition algorithms. Existing surgical phase recognition&#10;algorithms struggle to efficiently capture temporal contexts in video&#45;based&#10;scenarios, leading to insufficient performance. To address these issues, we&#10;propose SPRMamba, a novel Mamba&#45;based framework for ESD surgical phase&#10;recognition. SPRMamba leverages the strengths of Mamba for long&#45;term temporal&#10;modeling while introducing the Scaled Residual TranMamba block to enhance the&#10;capture of fine&#45;grained details, overcoming the limitations of traditional&#10;temporal models like Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformers.&#10;Moreover, a Temporal Sample Strategy is introduced to accelerate the&#10;processing, which is essential for real&#45;time phase recognition in clinical&#10;settings. Extensive testing on the ESD385 dataset and the cholecystectomy&#10;Cholec80 dataset demonstrates that SPRMamba surpasses existing state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art&#10;methods and exhibits greater robustness across various surgical phase&#10;recognition tasks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12108v1) |&#10;| Who&#39;s the GOAT?

In this work, we design a&#10;data&#45;driven random walk on the symmetric group to obtain a stationary&#10;distribution over player rankings, spanning across different time periods in&#10;sports history. We combine this distribution with a notion of stochastic&#10;dominance to obtain a partial order over the players.

Recent advances in AI have sparked renewed interest in this area, with&#10;large language models (LLMs) emerging as both tools and subjects of value&#10;measurement. This work introduces Generative Psychometrics for Values (GPV), an&#10;LLM&#45;based, data&#45;driven value measurement paradigm, theoretically grounded in&#10;text&#45;revealed selective perceptions. We begin by fine&#45;tuning an LLM for&#10;accurate perception&#45;level value measurement and verifying the capability of&#10;LLMs to parse texts into perceptions, forming the core of the GPV pipeline.&#10;Applying GPV to human&#45;authored blogs, we demonstrate its stability, validity,&#10;and superiority over prior psychological tools. Then, extending GPV to LLM&#10;value measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometric&#10;methodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free&#45;form&#10;outputs, enabling context&#45;specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis of&#10;measurement paradigms, indicating response biases of prior methods; and 3) an&#10;attempt to bridge LLM values and their safety, revealing the predictive power&#10;of different value systems and the impacts of various values on LLM safety.&#10;Through interdisciplinary efforts, we aim to leverage AI for next&#45;generation&#10;psychometrics and psychometrics for value&#45;aligned AI.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12106v1) |&#10;| FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated&#10; &#160;Long&#45;Tailed Learning | Xiuhua Lu, Peng Li, Xuefeng Jiang | &#160;&#160;Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy&#10;in distributed machine learning. However, datasets distributed across each&#10;client in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can&#10;be globally aggregated, they tend to be long&#45;tailed distributed, which greatly&#10;affects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated&#10;learning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it&#10;fails to address the phenomenon of class&#45;wise bias in global long&#45;tailed data.&#10;This results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting&#10;the equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a&#10;methodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,&#10;we propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the&#10;local training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred&#10;optimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art&#10;methods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long&#45;tailed&#10;distribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR&#45;10&#45;LT and&#10;CIFAR&#45;100&#45;LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of&#10;model performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long&#45;tailed&#10;distribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12105v1) |&#10;| Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error&#10; &#160;Detection | Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia | &#160;&#160;Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real&#45;world applications. Doing&#10;so requires overcoming the noise present on today&#39;s hardware. The quantum&#10;approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling&#10;up due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup&#10;over state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art classical algorithms for some problems. However,&#10;achieving better&#45;than&#45;classical performance with QAOA is believed to require&#10;fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault&#45;tolerant&#10;implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg&#39;&#39; error detection&#10;code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the&#10;algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with&#10;up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped&#45;ion quantum computer. Additionally, we&#10;propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance, and use it&#10;to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance&#10;to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our&#10;model can be used to determine necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform&#10;Goemans&#45;Williamson algorithm on future hardware. Our results demonstrate the&#10;largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially&#10;fault&#45;tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date,&#10;paving the way towards solving real&#45;world applications with quantum computers.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12104v1) |&#10;| Cyclicity Analysis of the Ornstein&#45;Uhlenbeck Process | Vivek Kaushik | &#160;&#160;In this thesis, we consider an $N$&#45;dimensional Ornstein&#45;Uhlenbeck (OU)&#10;process satisfying the linear stochastic differential equation $dmathbf x(t) =&#10;&#45; mathbf Bmathbf x(t) dt + boldsymbol Sigma d mathbf w(t).$ Here, $mathbf&#10;B$ is a fixed $N times N$ circulant friction matrix whose eigenvalues have&#10;positive real parts, $boldsymbol Sigma$ is a fixed $N times M$ matrix. We&#10;consider a signal propagation model governed by this OU process. In this model,&#10;an underlying signal propagates throughout a network consisting of $N$ linked&#10;sensors located in space. We interpret the $n$&#45;th component of the OU process&#10;as the measurement of the propagating effect made by the $n$&#45;th sensor. The&#10;matrix $mathbf B$ represents the sensor network structure: if $mathbf B$ has&#10;first row $(b_1 &#160;, &#160;dots &#160;, &#160;b_N),$ where $b_1&gt;0$ and $b_2 &#160;, &#160;dots , b_N &#10;e 0,$ then the magnitude of $b_p$ quantifies how receptive the $n$&#45;th&#10;sensor is to activity within the $(n+p&#45;1)$&#45;th sensor. Finally, the $(m,n)$&#45;th&#10;entry of the matrix $mathbf D = frac{boldsymbol Sigma boldsymbol&#10;Sigma^text T}{2}$ is the covariance of the component noises injected into the&#10;$m$&#45;th and $n$&#45;th sensors. For different choices of $mathbf B$ and&#10;$boldsymbol Sigma,$ we investigate whether Cyclicity Analysis enables us to&#10;recover the structure of network. Roughly speaking, Cyclicity Analysis studies&#10;the lead&#45;lag dynamics pertaining to the components of a multivariate signal. We&#10;specifically consider an $N times N$ skew&#45;symmetric matrix $mathbf Q,$ known&#10;as the lead matrix, in which the sign of its $(m,n)$&#45;th entry captures the&#10;lead&#45;lag relationship between the $m$&#45;th and $n$&#45;th component OU processes. We&#10;investigate whether the structure of the leading eigenvector of $mathbf Q,$&#10;the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of $mathbf Q$ in&#10;modulus, reflects the network structure induced by $mathbf B.$&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12102v1) |&#10;| Symmetry&#45;Enriched Learning: A Category&#45;Theoretic Framework for Robust&#10; &#160;Machine Learning Models | Ronald Katende | &#160;&#160;This manuscript presents a novel framework that integrates higher&#45;order&#10;symmetries and category theory into machine learning.

Recently, this&#10;curiosity has motivated the fMRI&#45;to&#45;image reconstruction task; given the fMRI&#10;data from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual&#10;stimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent&#10;Diffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex&#10;visual stimuli such as high&#45;resolution natural images from vision datasets.&#10;Despite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often&#10;lack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.&#10;Consequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere&#10;visuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs&#10;effectively incorporate multi&#45;modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,&#10;and image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image&#10;generations. Specifically, inspired by the two&#45;streams hypothesis suggesting&#10;that perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain&#10;regions, our framework, Brain&#45;Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain&#10;regions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from&#10;semantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information&#10;regions, Brain&#45;Streams provides accurate multi&#45;modal guidance to LDMs. We&#10;validate the reconstruction ability of Brain&#45;Streams both quantitatively and&#10;qualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI&#10;data.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12099v1) |&#10;| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal&#10; &#160;execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huyên Pham | &#160;&#160;Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and&#10;constraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity&#10;markets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general&#10;propagator model under linear functional inequality constraints. The optimal&#10;control is given explicitly in terms of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers&#10;and their conditional expectations, as a solution to a linear stochastic&#10;Fredholm equation.

The task of&#10;next&#45;best&#45;view (NBV) planning is to infer the pose of the next viewpoint based&#10;on the current data, and gradually realize the complete three&#45;dimensional&#10;reconstruction. Many existing algorithms, however, suffer a large computational&#10;burden due to the use of ray&#45;casting. To address this, this paper proposes a&#10;projection&#45;based NBV planning framework. It can select the next best view at an&#10;extremely fast speed while ensuring the complete scanning of the object.&#10;Specifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into&#10;ellipsoids based on the voxel structure.Then, the next best view is selected&#10;from the candidate views using a projection&#45;based viewpoint quality evaluation&#10;function in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy. This process&#10;replaces the ray&#45;casting in voxel structures, significantly improving the&#10;computational efficiency. Comparative experiments with other algorithms in a&#10;simulation environment show that the framework proposed in this paper can&#10;achieve 10 times efficiency improvement on the basis of capturing roughly the&#10;same coverage. The real&#45;world experimental results also prove the efficiency&#10;and feasibility of the framework.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12096v1) |&#10;| Undersampling effects on observed periods of coronal oscillations | Daye Lim, Tom Van Doorsselaere, Valery M. Nakariakov, Dmitrii Y. Kolotkov, Yuhang Gao, David Berghmans | &#160;&#160;Context. Recent observations of decayless transverse oscillations have shown&#10;two branches in the relationship between periods and loop lengths. One is a&#10;linear relationship, interpreted as a standing mode. The other shows almost no&#10;correlation and has not yet been interpreted conclusively. Aims. We&#10;investigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless&#10;oscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely&#10;follow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations&#10;are standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations&#10;where the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase&#10;are randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal&#10;by considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of&#10;telescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast&#10;Fourier transform. Results. When the sampling cadence is getting closer to the&#10;actual oscillation period, a tendency for overestimating periods in short loops&#10;is enhanced. The relationship between loop lengths and periods of the sampled&#10;signals shows the two branches as in the observation. Conclusions. We find that&#10;long periods of decayless oscillations occurring in short loops could be the&#10;result of undersampling.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12095v1) |&#10;| Enwrapped Perylene Bisimide Enables Room Temperature Polariton Lasing&#10; &#160;and Photonic Lattices | Dominik Horneber, Johannes Düreth, Tim Schembri, Simon Betzold, Matthias Stolte, Sven Höfling, Frank Würthner, Sebastian Klembt | &#160;&#160;Perylene bisimides (PBIs) are organic dyes with photoluminescence quantum&#10;yields (PLQY) close to unity in solution and great thermal and photo&#45;chemical&#10;stability. These features alongside the tunability of their solid&#45;state packing&#10;arrangement via chemical functionalization make this material class an&#10;excellent candidate for exciton&#45;polariton lasing at room temperature. Polariton&#10;lasing is well understood in III&#45;V semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures,&#10;however, the search for emitter materials for robust and versatile room&#10;temperature applications is ongoing. While e.g. perovskites and several organic&#10;materials have been identified to support polariton lasing, many of these&#10;materials lack tunability and long&#45;term stability under ambient conditions.&#10;Here, we fabricate optical microcavities using a strongly enwrapped PBI&#10;chromophore with prevailing monomer&#45;like absorption and emission properties in&#10;the solid state. Voluminous bay&#45;substituents prevent stacking induced&#10;PLQY&#45;quenching, thereby enabling polariton lasing at room temperature.&#10;Additionally, photonic confinement in single hemispheric resonators is&#10;demonstrated leading to localized polaritonic modes with discrete energies, as&#10;well as optical lattices revealing distinct polaritonic band&#45;structures. Due to&#10;the possibility of tunable properties by the precise control of the solid&#45;state&#10;packing arrangement of PBI emitters, our results pave the way for&#10;polarization&#45;dependent light&#45;matter coupling, including topological photonic&#10;effects within oriented crystalline thin&#45;film microcavity structures.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12093v1) |&#10;| IMRL: Integrating Visual, Physical, Temporal, and Geometric&#10; &#160;Representations for Enhanced Food Acquisition | Rui Liu, Zahiruddin Mahammad, Amisha Bhaskar, Pratap Tokekar | &#160;&#160;Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality&#10;of life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse&#10;food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents&#10;unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface&#45;level geometric&#10;information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g.,&#10;color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially&#10;when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance.&#10;We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition.&#10;Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy&#10;based on off&#45;the&#45;shelf image encoders such as ResNet&#45;50. However, such&#10;representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse&#10;acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel&#10;approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi&#45;Dimensional Representation Learning), which&#10;integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance&#10;the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach&#10;captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi&#45;solid, granular,&#10;liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and&#10;introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and&#10;assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies&#10;based on context, improving the robot&#39;s capability to handle diverse food&#10;acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach&#39;s&#10;robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations,&#10;including zero&#45;shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves&#10;improvement up to $35%$ in success rate compared with the best&#45;performing&#10;baseline.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12092v1) |&#10;| Uncovering liquid&#45;substrate fluctuation effects on crystal growth and&#10; &#160;disordered hyperuniformity of two&#45;dimensional materials | S. K. Mkhonta, Zhi&#45;Feng Huang, K. R. Elder | &#160;&#160;We investigate the growth of two&#45;dimensional (2D) crystals on fluctuating&#10;surfaces using a phase field crystal model that is relevant on atomic length&#10;and diffusive time scales. Motivated by recent experiments which achieved&#10;unprecedented fast growth of large&#45;size high&#45;quality 2D crystals on liquid&#10;substrates, we uncover novel effects of liquid surfaces on microstructural&#10;ordering. We find that substrate fluctuations generate short&#45;ranged noise that&#10;speeds up crystallization and grain growth of the overlayer, surpassing that of&#10;free&#45;standing system. Coupling to the liquid substrate fluctuations can also&#10;modulate local randomness, leading to intriguing disordered structures with&#10;hidden spatial order, i.e., disordered hyperuniformity. These results reveal&#10;the physical mechanisms underlying the fast growth of 2D crystals on liquid&#10;surfaces and demonstrate a novel strategy for synthesizing disordered&#10;hyperuniform thin film structures.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12090v1) |&#10;| The Impact of Element Ordering on LM Agent Performance | Wayne Chi, Ameet Talwalkar, Chris Donahue | &#160;&#160;There has been a surge of interest in language model agents that can navigate&#10;virtual environments such as the web or desktop. To navigate such environments,&#10;agents benefit from information on the various elements (e.g., buttons, text,&#10;or images) present. It remains unclear which element attributes have the&#10;greatest impact on agent performance, especially in environments that only&#10;provide a graphical representation (i.e., pixels). Here we find that the&#10;ordering in which elements are presented to the language model is surprisingly&#10;impactful&#45;&#45;randomizing element ordering in a webpage degrades agent performance&#10;comparably to removing all visible text from an agent&#39;s state representation.&#10;While a webpage provides a hierarchical ordering of elements, there is no such&#10;ordering when parsing elements directly from pixels. Moreover, as tasks become&#10;more challenging and models more sophisticated, our experiments suggest that&#10;the impact of ordering increases. Finding an effective ordering is non&#45;trivial.&#10;We investigate the impact of various element ordering methods in web and&#10;desktop environments. We find that dimensionality reduction provides a viable&#10;ordering for pixel&#45;only environments. We train a UI element detection model to&#10;derive elements from pixels and apply our findings to an agent&#10;benchmark&#45;&#45;OmniACT&#45;&#45;where we only have access to pixels. Our method completes&#10;more than two times as many tasks on average relative to the previous&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12089v2) |&#10;| Quark saturation in the QCD phase diagram | Marcus Bluhm, Yuki Fujimoto, Larry McLerran, Marlene Nahrgang | &#160;&#160;We determine the onset of Quarkyonic Matter corresponding to values of&#10;temperature and baryon chemical potential at which the quark phase space&#10;density becomes one. At zero temperature for baryon chemical potentials below&#10;the mass of the Lambda baryon, only nucleons contribute to the quark density.&#10;This is different at finite temperature, where all baryons, mesons and their&#10;resonances can be excited and thus add quarks to the phase space. The&#10;probability density to find a quark inside a hadron is determined using the&#10;Yukawa ansatz of the IdylliQ model of Quarkyonic Matter. We estimate separately&#10;the magnitude of the various contributions of nucleons, Delta baryons, pions as&#10;well as further hadrons and resonances. The uncertainty in the parametrization&#10;of the probability density to find a quark inside a nucleon is spanned by&#10;assuming that at zero temperature the transition density to Quarkyonic Matter&#10;is between one and three times that of nuclear matter. Various predictions for&#10;a possible critical point associated with the chiral phase transition are found&#10;close to a triple point at which the line of the deconfinement transition and&#10;the curve associated with the transition to Quarkyonic Matter intersect. These&#10;considerations provide an estimate for the region in the QCD phase diagram&#10;where Quarkyonic Matter may be found.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12088v1) |&#10;| Towards Interpretable End&#45;Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Prediction:&#10; &#160;Utilizing Administrative Claims Data with Explainable AI Techniques | Yubo Li, Saba Al&#45;Sayouri, Rema Padman | &#160;&#160;This study explores the potential of utilizing administrative claims data,&#10;combined with advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, to&#10;predict the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to End&#45;Stage Renal&#10;Disease (ESRD). We analyze a comprehensive, 10&#45;year dataset provided by a major&#10;health insurance organization to develop prediction models for multiple&#10;observation windows using traditional machine learning methods such as Random&#10;Forest and XGBoost as well as deep learning approaches such as Long Short&#45;Term&#10;Memory (LSTM) networks. Our findings demonstrate that the LSTM model,&#10;particularly with a 24&#45;month observation window, exhibits superior performance&#10;in predicting ESRD progression, outperforming existing models in the&#10;literature. We further apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to&#10;enhance interpretability, providing insights into the impact of individual&#10;features on predictions at the individual patient level. This study underscores&#10;the value of leveraging administrative claims data for CKD management and&#10;predicting ESRD progression.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12087v1) |&#10;| Unveiling the Secrets of New Physics Through Top Quark Tagging | Rameswar Sahu, Saiyad Ashanujjaman, Kirtiman Ghosh | &#160;&#160;The ubiquity of top&#45;rich final states in the context of beyond the Standard&#10;Model (BSM) searches has led to their status as extensively studied signatures&#10;at the LHC. Over the past decade, numerous endeavours have been undertaken in&#10;the literature to develop methods for efficiently distinguishing boosted top&#10;quark jets from QCD jets. Although cut&#45;based strategies for boosted top&#10;tagging, which rely on substructure information from fat jets resulting from&#10;the hadronic decay of boosted top quarks, were introduced in the literature as&#10;early as 2008, recent years have witnessed a surge in the utilization of&#10;machine learning&#45;based approaches for the classification of top&#45;jets from QCD&#10;jets.

We solve the inverse problem modeling the distribution&#10;amplitude, and we match our results to the light&#45;cone in the&#10;$overline{text{MS}}$&#45;scheme.

Agyeman, Jinfeng Liu, Sirish L. Shah | &#160;&#160;Efficient water management in agriculture is important for mitigating the&#10;growing freshwater scarcity crisis. Mixed&#45;integer Model Predictive Control&#10;(MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex&#10;scheduling problems in agricultural irrigation. However, the computational&#10;complexity of mixed&#45;integer MPC still poses a significant challenge,&#10;particularly in large&#45;scale applications. This study proposes an approach to&#10;enhance the computational efficiency of mixed&#45;integer MPC&#45;based irrigation&#10;schedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture&#10;dynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed&#45;integer linear&#10;representation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the&#10;mixed&#45;integer MPC&#45;based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a&#10;mixed&#45;integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed&#45;integer&#10;nonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global&#10;optimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated&#10;through comparative studies conducted on a large&#45;scale agricultural field&#10;across two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models,&#10;specifically Long Short&#45;Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used&#10;triggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU&#45;based approach significantly&#10;reduces solution times &#45;&#45; by up to 99.5% &#45;&#45; while achieving comparable&#10;performance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water&#10;Use Efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, the ReLU&#45;based approach maintains enhanced&#10;performance in terms of total prescribed irrigation and IWUE compared to the&#10;widely&#45;used triggered irrigation scheduling method.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12082v1) |&#10;| Design of Ligand&#45;Binding Proteins with Atomic Flow Matching | Junqi Liu, Shaoning Li, Chence Shi, Zhi Yang, Jian Tang | &#160;&#160;Designing novel proteins that bind to small molecules is a long&#45;standing&#10;challenge in computational biology, with applications in developing catalysts,&#10;biosensors, and more. Current computational methods rely on the assumption that&#10;the binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible,&#10;as conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon&#10;binding. In this work, we formulate proteins and molecules as unified&#10;biotokens, and present AtomFlow, a novel deep generative model under the&#10;flow&#45;matching framework for the design of ligand&#45;binding proteins from the 2D&#10;target molecular graph alone. Operating on representative atoms of biotokens,&#10;AtomFlow captures the flexibility of ligands and generates ligand conformations&#10;and protein backbone structures iteratively. We consider the multi&#45;scale nature&#10;of biotokens and demonstrate that AtomFlow can be effectively trained on a&#10;subset of structures from the Protein Data Bank, by matching flow vector field&#10;using an SE(3) equivariant structure prediction network. Experimental results&#10;show that our method can generate high fidelity ligand&#45;binding proteins and&#10;achieve performance comparable to the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art model RFDiffusionAA,&#10;while not requiring bound ligand structures. As a general framework, AtomFlow&#10;holds the potential to be applied to various biomolecule generation tasks in&#10;the future.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12080v1) |&#10;| Denoising diffusion models for high&#45;resolution microscopy image&#10; &#160;restoration | Pamela Osuna&#45;Vargas, Maren H. Wehrheim, Lucas Zinz, Johanna Rahm, Ashwin Balakrishnan, Alexandra Kaminer, Mike Heilemann, Matthias Kaschube | &#160;&#160;Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at&#10;the nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological&#10;organization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of&#10;fluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses&#10;remain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced&#10;laser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and&#10;increased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a&#10;denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high&#45;resolution&#10;images by conditioning the model on low&#45;resolution information. Additionally,&#10;the probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images&#10;that tend to further increase the signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio. We show that our model&#10;achieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously&#10;best&#45;performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly,&#10;while any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but&#10;not all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all&#10;four data sets, suggesting high generalizability.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12078v1) |&#10;| Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Via Data Pruning | Andrea Napoli, Paul White | &#160;&#160;The removal of carefully&#45;selected examples from training data has recently&#10;emerged as an effective way of improving the robustness of machine learning&#10;models. However, the best way to select these examples remains an open&#10;question. In this paper, we consider the problem from the perspective of&#10;unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). We propose AdaPrune, a method for UDA&#10;whereby training examples are removed to attempt to align the training&#10;distribution to that of the target data. By adopting the maximum mean&#10;discrepancy (MMD) as the criterion for alignment, the problem can be neatly&#10;formulated and solved as an integer quadratic program. We evaluate our approach&#10;on a real&#45;world domain shift task of bioacoustic event detection. As a method&#10;for UDA, we show that AdaPrune outperforms related techniques, and is&#10;complementary to other UDA algorithms such as CORAL. Our analysis of the&#10;relationship between the MMD and model accuracy, along with t&#45;SNE plots,&#10;validate the proposed method as a principled and well&#45;founded way of performing&#10;data pruning.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12076v1) |&#10;| The elastica sling | Alessandro Cazzolli, Francesco Dal Corso | &#160;&#160;The nonlinear mechanics of a flexible elastic rod constrained at its edges by&#10;a pair of sliding sleeves is analyzed. The planar equilibrium configurations of&#10;this variable&#45;length elastica are found to have shape defined only by the&#10;inclination of the two constraints, while their distance is responsible only&#10;for scaling the size. By extending the theoretical stability criterion&#10;available for systems under isoperimetric constraints to the case of variable&#10;domains, the existence of no more than one stable equilibrium solution is&#10;revealed. The set of sliding sleeves&#39; inclination pairs for which the stability&#10;is lost are identified. Such critical conditions allow the indefinite ejection&#10;of the flexible rod from the sliding sleeves, thus realizing an elastica sling.&#10;Finally, the theoretical findings are validated by experiments on a physical&#10;prototype. The present results lead to a novel actuation principle that may&#10;find application as a mechanism in energy harvesting, wave mitigation devices,&#10;and soft robotic locomotion.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12075v1) |&#10;| Online Refractive Camera Model Calibration in Visual Inertial Odometry | Mohit Singh, Kostas Alexis | &#160;&#160;This paper presents a general refractive camera model and online&#10;co&#45;estimation of odometry and the refractive index of unknown media. This&#10;enables operation in diverse and varying refractive fluids, given only the&#10;camera calibration in air. The refractive index is estimated online as a state&#10;variable of a monocular visual&#45;inertial odometry framework in an iterative&#10;formulation using the proposed camera model. The method was verified on data&#10;collected using an underwater robot traversing inside a pool. The evaluations&#10;demonstrate convergence to the ideal refractive index for water despite&#10;significant perturbations in the initialization. Simultaneously, the approach&#10;enables on&#45;par visual&#45;inertial odometry performance in refractive media without&#10;prior knowledge of the refractive index or requirement of medium&#45;specific&#10;camera calibration.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12074v1) |&#10;| Influence of dislocations in multilayer graphene stacks: A phase field&#10; &#160;crystal study | K. R. Elder, Zhi&#45;Feng Huang, T. Ala&#45;Nissila | &#160;&#160;In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene&#10;stacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a&#10;recently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems&#10;incorporating out&#45;of&#45;plane deformations and parameterized to match to density&#10;functional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems. The&#10;specific configuration considered consists of one monolayer containing four&#10;$5|7$ dislocations (i.e., two dislocation dipoles) sandwiched in between&#10;perfect graphene layers. The study reveals how the strain field from the&#10;dislocations in the defected layer leads to out&#45;of&#45;plane deformations that in&#10;turn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are&#10;made for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a&#10;defect&#45;free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and&#10;system size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by&#10;roughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence&#10;across the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height&#10;profiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12073v1) |&#10;| PAD&#45;FT: A Lightweight Defense for Backdoor Attacks via Data Purification&#10; &#160;and Fine&#45;Tuning | Yukai Xu, Yujie Gu, Kouichi Sakurai | &#160;&#160;Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks,&#10;particularly as recent advancements have led to increasingly subtle&#10;implantation, making the defense more challenging. Existing defense mechanisms&#10;typically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and&#10;involve retraining an auxiliary model or fine&#45;tuning the entire victim model.&#10;However, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always&#10;feasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and&#10;lightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD&#45;FT, that does not require an&#10;additional clean dataset and fine&#45;tunes only a very small part of the model to&#10;disinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a&#10;simple data purification process to identify and select the most&#45;likely clean&#10;data from the poisoned training dataset. The self&#45;purified clean dataset is&#10;then used for activation clipping and fine&#45;tuning only the last classification&#10;layer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation&#10;clipping, and classifier fine&#45;tuning, our mechanism PAD&#45;FT demonstrates&#10;superior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as&#10;confirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12072v1) |&#10;| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing&#10; &#160;data in Irish sagas | P. MacCarron | &#160;&#160;For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts&#10;in order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify&#10;similarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the&#10;significance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture&#10;requires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and&#10;often impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the&#10;network of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that&#10;the top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent&#10;with central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has&#10;been lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust&#10;to a large random removal of edges.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12071v1) |&#10;| The repetition threshold for ternary rich words | James D. Currie, Lucas Mol, Jarkko Peltomäki | &#160;&#160;In 2014, Vesti proposed the problem of determining the repetition threshold&#10;for infinite rich words, i.e., for infinite words in which all factors of&#10;length $n$ contain $n$ distinct nonempty palindromic factors. In 2020, Currie,&#10;Mol, and Rampersad proved a conjecture of Baranwal and Shallit that the&#10;repetition threshold for binary rich words is $2 + sqrt{2}/2$. In this paper,&#10;we prove a structure theorem for $16/7$&#45;power&#45;free ternary rich words. Using&#10;the structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich&#10;words is $1 + 1/(3 &#45; mu) approx 2.25876324$, where $mu$ is the unique real&#10;root of the polynomial $x^3 &#45; 2x^2 &#45; 1$.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12068v1) |&#10;| Fitting Multilevel Factor Models | Tetiana Parshakova, Trevor Hastie, Stephen Boyd | &#160;&#160;We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance&#10;given by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~cite{parshakova2023factor}. We&#10;develop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation&#45;maximization (EM)&#10;algorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of&#10;the observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and&#10;maintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved&#10;through a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive&#10;definite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of an invertible PSD MLR matrix&#10;is also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the&#10;recursive Sherman&#45;Morrison&#45;Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of&#10;the inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky&#10;factorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities,&#10;yielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement.

Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by&#10;tidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to&#10;their proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the&#10;TRAPPIST&#45;1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In&#10;this work, we present the recent implementation of the co&#45;planar tidal torque&#10;and forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N&#45;body code&#10;Posidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using&#10;a tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of&#10;each planet by taking into account their multi&#45;layer internal structure&#10;computed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST&#45;1 planets&#10;are not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state.&#10;Planet&#45;planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and&#10;tides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a&#10;result, the sub&#45;stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and&#10;long&#45;timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with&#10;periods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12065v1) |&#10;| Quantum Magic and Multi&#45;Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei | Florian Brökemeier, S.

Valence&#45;space nuclear&#10;shell&#45;model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit&#10;registers using the Jordan&#45;Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$&#45;shell and 24&#10;qubits for the $sd$&#45;shell), from which measures of the many&#45;body entanglement&#10;($n$&#45;tangles) and magic (non&#45;stabilizerness) are determined. While exact&#10;evaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of&#10;active nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex&#10;nuclei. The broadly&#45;applicable Pauli&#45;String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe&#45;) MCMC technique&#10;is introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed&#10;nuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $sim 8$ for some&#10;nuclei. Significant multi&#45;nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$&#45;shell,&#10;dominated by proton&#45;neutron configurations, along with significant measures of&#10;magic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on&#10;the path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion.&#10;These results indicate that quantum&#45;computing resources will accelerate&#10;precision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12064v1) |&#10;| Post&#45;Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a&#10; &#160;massive, rotating object | Lorenzo Iorio | &#160;&#160;The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the&#10;general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense&#45;Thirring&#10;components of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are&#10;analytically worked out to the first post&#45;Newtonian level. To the Newtonian&#10;order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as&#10;well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation&#10;in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the&#10;primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first&#10;to &#39;Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system&#10;along an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred&#10;close to the Sun&#39;s flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due&#10;to the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of&#10;microarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for&#10;the post&#45;Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)&#10;spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of&#10;the latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current&#10;(formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would&#10;bring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the&#10;predicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not&#10;changed by any of the post&#45;&#45;Keplerian accelerations considered. The&#10;calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any&#10;alternative models of gravity as well.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12063v1) |&#10;| Generalized Robot Learning Framework | Jiahuan Yan, Zhouyang Hong, Yu Zhao, Yu Tian, Yunxin Liu, Travis Davies, Luhui Hu | &#160;&#160;Imitation based robot learning has recently gained significant attention in&#10;the robotics field due to its theoretical potential for transferability and&#10;generalizability. However, it remains notoriously costly, both in terms of&#10;hardware and data collection, and deploying it in real&#45;world environments&#10;demands meticulous setup of robots and precise experimental conditions. In this&#10;paper, we present a low&#45;cost robot learning framework that is both easily&#10;reproducible and transferable to various robots and environments. We&#10;demonstrate that deployable imitation learning can be successfully applied even&#10;to industrial&#45;grade robots, not just expensive collaborative robotic arms.&#10;Furthermore, our results show that multi&#45;task robot learning is achievable with&#10;simple network architectures and fewer demonstrations than previously thought&#10;necessary. As the current evaluating method is almost subjective when it comes&#10;to real&#45;world manipulation tasks, we propose Voting Positive Rate (VPR) &#45; a&#10;novel evaluation strategy that provides a more objective assessment of&#10;performance. We conduct an extensive comparison of success rates across various&#10;self&#45;designed tasks to validate our approach. To foster collaboration and&#10;support the robot learning community, we have open&#45;sourced all relevant&#10;datasets and model checkpoints, available at huggingface.co/ZhiChengAI.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12061v1) |&#10;| PARAPHRASUS : A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Paraphrase&#10; &#160;Detection Models | Andrianos Michail, Simon Clematide, Juri Opitz | &#160;&#160;The task of determining whether two texts are paraphrases has long been a&#10;challenge in NLP. However, the prevailing notion of paraphrase is often quite&#10;simplistic, offering only a limited view of the vast spectrum of paraphrase&#10;phenomena. Indeed, we find that evaluating models in a paraphrase dataset can&#10;leave uncertainty about their true semantic understanding. To alleviate this,&#10;we release paraphrasus, a benchmark designed for multi&#45;dimensional assessment&#10;of paraphrase detection models and finer model selection. We find that&#10;paraphrase detection models under a fine&#45;grained evaluation lens exhibit&#10;trade&#45;offs that cannot be captured through a single classification dataset.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12060v1) |&#10;| Dual&#45;Layer Training and Decoding of Large Language Model with&#10; &#160;Simultaneously Thinking and Speaking | Ningyuan Xi, Xiaoyu Wang, Yetao Wu, Teng Chen, Qingqing Gu, Jinxian Qu, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong Chen, Luo Ji | &#160;&#160;Large Language Model can reasonably understand and generate human expressions&#10;but may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have&#10;been several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but&#10;most of them are not data&#45;driven or training&#45;based. In this paper, we are&#10;motivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel&#10;model architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts&#10;and then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines&#10;to annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt&#45;response samples, then&#10;add language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We&#10;train the language model by the thoughts&#45;augmented data and successfully let&#10;the thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally&#10;output more reasonable responses. Both qualitative examples and quantitative&#10;results validate the effectiveness and performance of TaS.

Using this&#10;framework and through experiments, explanations on the response of a neural&#10;network are given by pointing out the output classes that are easily reachable&#10;from a given input. This emphasizes how the proposed mathematical relationship&#10;between the output of the network and the geometry of its inputs can be&#10;exploited as an explainable artificial intelligence tool.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12057v1) |&#10;| Artemis: Efficient Commit&#45;and&#45;Prove SNARKs for zkML | Hidde Lycklama, Alexander Viand, Nikolay Avramov, Nicolas Küchler, Anwar Hithnawi | &#160;&#160;The widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) in various critical&#10;applications, from healthcare to autonomous systems, has raised significant&#10;concerns about privacy, accountability, and trustworthiness. To address these&#10;concerns, recent research has focused on developing zero&#45;knowledge machine&#10;learning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of&#10;ML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have&#10;substantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily&#10;optimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the&#10;substantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the&#10;model and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new&#10;Commit&#45;and&#45;Prove SNARK (CP&#45;SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that&#10;effectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML&#10;pipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white&#45;box use of the&#10;underlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic&#10;polynomial commitment and only makes black&#45;box use of the proof system. As a&#10;result, Artemis is compatible with state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art proof systems without&#10;trusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP&#45;SNARKs, evaluate&#10;their performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial&#10;improvements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover&#10;costs and maintaining efficiency even for large&#45;scale models. For example, for&#10;the VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from&#10;11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML&#10;towards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and&#10;complex ML models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12055v1) |&#10;| MMP for Enriques pairs and singular Enriques varieties | Francesco Antonio Denisi, Ángel David Ríos Ortiz, Nikolaos Tsakanikas, Zhixin Xie | &#160;&#160;We introduce and study the class of primitive Enriques varieties, whose&#10;smooth members are Enriques manifolds. We provide several examples and we&#10;demonstrate that this class is stable under the operations of the Minimal Model&#10;Program (MMP). In particular, given an Enriques manifold $Y$ and an effective&#10;$mathbb{R}$&#45;divisor $B_Y$ on $Y$ such that the pair $(Y,B_Y)$ is log&#10;canonical, we prove that any $(K_Y+B_Y)$&#45;MMP terminates with a minimal model&#10;$(Y&#39;,B_{Y&#39;})$ of $(Y,B_Y)$, where $Y&#39;$ is a $mathbb{Q}$&#45;factorial primitive&#10;Enriques variety with canonical singularities. Finally, we investigate the&#10;asymptotic theory of Enriques manifolds.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12054v1) |&#10;| Numerical renormalization group calculations for magnetic impurity&#10; &#160;systems with spin&#45;orbit coupling and crystal&#45;field effects | Aitor Calvo&#45;Fernández, María Blanco&#45;Rey, Asier Eiguren | &#160;&#160;Exploiting symmetries in the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method&#10;significantly enhances performance by improving accuracy, increasing&#10;computational speed, and optimizing memory efficiency. Published codes focus on&#10;continuous rotations and unitary groups, which generally are not applicable to&#10;systems with strong crystal&#45;field effects. The PointGroupNRG code implements&#10;symmetries related to discrete rotation groups, which are defined by the user&#10;in terms of Clebsch&#45;Gordan coefficients, together with particle conservation&#10;and spin rotation symmetries. In this paper we present a new version of the&#10;code that extends the available finite groups, previously limited to simply&#10;reducible point groups, in a way that all point and double groups become&#10;accessible. It also includes the full spin&#45;orbital rotation group. Moreover, to&#10;improve the code&#39;s flexibility for impurities with complex interactions, this&#10;new version allows to choose between a standard Anderson Hamiltonian for the&#10;impurity or, as another novel feature, an ionic model that requires only the&#10;spectrum and the impurity Lehmann amplitudes.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12050v1) |&#10;| Quantum&#45;like nonlinear interferometry with frequency&#45;engineered&#10; &#160;classical light | Romain Dalidet, Anthony Martin, Grégory Sauder, Laurent Labonté, Sébastien Tanzilli | &#160;&#160;Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic&#10;entanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits. Nonlinear&#10;optics has served as a workhorse for the generation of entangled photon pairs,&#10;ensuring both energy and phase conservation, but at the cost of limited rate&#10;and degraded signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio compared to laser&#45;based interferometry&#10;approaches. We present a &quot;quantum&#45;like&quot; nonlinear optical method that reaches&#10;super&#45;resolution in single&#45;photon detection regime. This is achieved by&#10;replacing photon&#45;pairs by coherent states of light, mimicking quantum&#10;properties through classical nonlinear optics processes. Our scheme utilizes&#10;two high&#45;brightness lasers. This results in a substantially greater&#10;signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio compared to its quantum counterpart. Such an approach&#10;paves the way to significantly reduced acquisition times, providing a pathway&#10;to explore signals across a broader range of bandwidth. The need to increase&#10;the frequency bandwidth of the quantum sensor significantly motivates the&#10;potential applications of this pathway.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12049v1) |&#10;| A Survey&#45;Based Quantitative Analysis of Stress Factors and Their Impacts&#10; &#160;Among Cybersecurity Professionals | Sunil Arora, John D. Hastings | &#160;&#160;This study investigates the prevalence and underlying causes of work&#45;related&#10;stress and burnout among cybersecurity professionals using a quantitative&#10;survey approach guided by the Job Demands&#45;Resources model. Analysis of&#10;responses from 50 cybersecurity practitioners reveals an alarming reality: 44%&#10;report experiencing severe work&#45;related stress and burnout, while an additional&#10;28% are uncertain about their condition. The demanding nature of cybersecurity&#10;roles, unrealistic expectations, and unsupportive organizational cultures&#10;emerge as primary factors fueling this crisis. Notably, 66% of respondents&#10;perceive cybersecurity jobs as more stressful than other IT positions, with 84%&#10;facing additional challenges due to the pandemic and recent high&#45;profile&#10;breaches. The study finds that most cybersecurity experts are reluctant to&#10;report their struggles to management, perpetuating a cycle of silence and&#10;neglect. To address this critical issue, the paper recommends that&#10;organizations foster supportive work environments, implement mindfulness&#10;programs, and address systemic challenges. By prioritizing the mental health of&#10;cybersecurity professionals, organizations can cultivate a more resilient and&#10;effective workforce to protect against an ever&#45;evolving threat landscape.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12047v1) |&#10;| Using Large Language Models to Generate Clinical Trial Tables and&#10; &#160;Figures | Yumeng Yang, Peter Krusche, Kristyn Pantoja, Cheng Shi, Ethan Ludmir, Kirk Roberts, Gen Zhu | &#160;&#160;Tables, figures, and listings (TFLs) are essential tools for summarizing&#10;clinical trial data. Creation of TFLs for reporting activities is often a&#10;time&#45;consuming task encountered routinely during the execution of clinical&#10;trials. This study explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate&#10;the generation of TFLs through prompt engineering and few&#45;shot transfer&#10;learning. Using public clinical trial data in ADaM format, our results&#10;demonstrated that LLMs can efficiently generate TFLs with prompt instructions,&#10;showcasing their potential in this domain. Furthermore, we developed a&#10;conservational agent named Clinical Trial TFL Generation Agent: An app that&#10;matches user queries to predefined prompts that produce customized programs to&#10;generate specific predefined TFLs.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12046v2) |&#10;| Handling Long&#45;Term Safety and Uncertainty in Safe Reinforcement Learning | Jonas Günster, Puze Liu, Jan Peters, Davide Tateo | &#160;&#160;Safety is one of the key issues preventing the deployment of reinforcement&#10;learning techniques in real&#45;world robots. While most approaches in the Safe&#10;Reinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and&#10;robot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them&#10;in complex real&#45;world settings. Instead, model&#45;based approaches that&#10;incorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning&#10;framework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on&#10;the real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot&#10;dynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task&#45;specific and hard&#10;to obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to&#10;compute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long&#45;term safety&#10;requirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe&#10;exploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus&#10;on ensuring long&#45;term safety and handling of uncertainty. Our approach is&#10;competitive or superior to state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methods in final performance while&#10;maintaining safer behavior during training.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12045v1) |&#10;| Quasiperiodic Floquet&#45;Gibbs states in Rydberg atomic systems | Wilson S. Martins, Federico Carollo, Kay Brandner, Igor Lesanovsky | &#160;&#160;Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by&#10;fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an&#10;equilibrium&#45;like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet&#45;Magnus&#10;Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi&#39;s golden rule, we show&#10;that such Floquet&#45;Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated&#10;Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab&#45;frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function&#10;of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the&#10;system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which&#10;is necessary to uphold high&#45;lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To&#10;corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five&#10;interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate&#10;numerically that the second&#45;order Floquet&#45;Gibbs state of this system is&#10;essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding&#10;Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently&#10;large.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12044v1) |&#10;| Understanding the Effects of the Baidu&#45;ULTR Logging Policy on Two&#45;Tower&#10; &#160;Models | Morris de Haan, Philipp Hager | &#160;&#160;Despite the popularity of the two&#45;tower model for unbiased learning to rank&#10;(ULTR) tasks, recent work suggests that it suffers from a major limitation that&#10;could lead to its collapse in industry applications: the problem of logging&#10;policy confounding. Several potential solutions have even been proposed;&#10;however, the evaluation of these methods was mostly conducted using&#10;semi&#45;synthetic simulation experiments. This paper bridges the gap between&#10;theory and practice by investigating the confounding problem on the largest&#10;real&#45;world dataset, Baidu&#45;ULTR. Our main contributions are threefold: 1) we&#10;show that the conditions for the confounding problem are given on Baidu&#45;ULTR,&#10;2) the confounding problem bears no significant effect on the two&#45;tower model,&#10;and 3) we point to a potential mismatch between expert annotations, the golden&#10;standard in ULTR, and user click behavior.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12043v1) |&#10;| ASR Benchmarking: Need for a More Representative Conversational Dataset | Gaurav Maheshwari, Dmitry Ivanov, Théo Johannet, Kevin El Haddad | &#160;&#160;Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable&#10;performance on widely used benchmarks such as LibriSpeech and Fleurs. However,&#10;these benchmarks do not adequately reflect the complexities of real&#45;world&#10;conversational environments, where speech is often unstructured and contains&#10;disfluencies such as pauses, interruptions, and diverse accents. In this study,&#10;we introduce a multilingual conversational dataset, derived from TalkBank,&#10;consisting of unstructured phone conversation between adults. Our results show&#10;a significant performance drop across various state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art ASR models when&#10;tested in conversational settings. Furthermore, we observe a correlation&#10;between Word Error Rate and the presence of speech disfluencies, highlighting&#10;the critical need for more realistic, conversational ASR benchmarks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12042v1) |&#10;&#10;">

However, current methods often require hundreds to&#10;thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high&#45;dimensional visual&#10;observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual&#10;representations are predominantly either pretrained on out&#45;of&#45;domain data or&#10;trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present&#10;DynaMo, a new in&#45;domain, self&#45;supervised method for learning visual&#10;representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a&#10;latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of&#10;image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without&#10;augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.&#10;Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out&#45;of&#45;domain data such as Internet&#10;datasets or cross&#45;embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real&#10;environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly&#10;improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self&#45;supervised&#10;learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo&#10;hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,&#10;and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and&#10;measure its impact on downstream policy performance.

Qwen2&#45;VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,&#10;which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions&#10;into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to&#10;generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning&#10;with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary&#10;Position Embedding (M&#45;RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional&#10;information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for&#10;processing both images and videos, enhancing the model&#39;s visual perception&#10;capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2&#45;VL&#10;investigates the scaling laws for large vision&#45;language models (LVLMs). By&#10;scaling both the model size&#45;with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters&#45;and the&#10;amount of training data, the Qwen2&#45;VL Series achieves highly competitive&#10;performance. Notably, the Qwen2&#45;VL&#45;72B model achieves results comparable to&#10;leading models such as GPT&#45;4o and Claude3.5&#45;Sonnet across various multimodal&#10;benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models.

BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses&#10;and 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance&#10;of deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to&#10;integrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and&#10;performance. However, widely&#45;used C++&#45;based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,&#10;g$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries&#10;like PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of&#10;debugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we&#10;introduce an eager&#45;mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,&#10;providing PyTorch&#45;compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach&#10;includes GPU&#45;accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for&#10;2nd&#45;order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear&#10;solvers. Our eager&#45;mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency,&#10;achieving an average speedup of 18.5$times$, 22$times$, and 23$times$&#10;compared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12190v1) |&#10;| Massively Multi&#45;Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context | Felix B Mueller, Julian Tanke, Juergen Gall | &#160;&#160;Forecasting long&#45;term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of&#10;human behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input&#10;sequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby&#10;people can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene&#45;aware social&#10;transformer model (SAST) to forecast long&#45;term (10s) human motion motion.&#10;Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely&#10;varying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal&#10;convolutional encoder&#45;decoder architecture with a Transformer&#45;based bottleneck&#10;that allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model&#10;the conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We&#10;benchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to&#10;16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously. Our model&#10;outperforms other approaches in terms of realism and diversity on different&#10;metrics and in a user study.

Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon | &#160;&#160;Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a&#10;perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from&#10;fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($mu$&#45;distortion) to late&#45;time&#10;baryonic feedback processes (y&#45;distortion). While the y&#45;distortion can be&#10;detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the&#10;$Lambda$CDM&#45;predicted $mu$&#45;distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude&#10;smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a&#10;serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $mu$&#10;arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the&#10;primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k approx 1&#45;10^{4}$ Mpc$^{&#45;1}$. Here,&#10;we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly&#10;detecting $mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but&#10;with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we&#10;optimize the instrument&#39;s configuration to target $mu$ while robustly&#10;marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike&#10;Fourier&#45;transform&#45;spectrometer&#45;based designs, the specific bands and their&#10;individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing&#10;significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the&#10;$Lambda$CDM&#45;predicted $mu$&#45;distortion at $approx 5sigma$ (10$sigma$)&#10;assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission&#10;duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized&#10;configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1&#45;2000 GHz with degree&#45;scale angular&#10;resolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally&#10;measure the y&#45;distortion at sub&#45;percent precision and its relativistic&#10;correction at percent&#45;level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total&#10;thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12188v1) |&#10;| Exoplanet accretion monitoring spectroscopic survey (ENTROPY) I.&#10; &#160;Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary&#45;mass&#10; &#160;object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C.

Detection of emission lines from&#10;accreting gas giants facilitate detailed investigations into this process. This&#10;work presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known&#10;young, planetary&#45;mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf&#10;2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7&#45;21 Mj and age 5&#45;45 Myr, located at 45+&#45;2&#10;pc. We obtained the first high&#45;resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target&#10;with VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near&#45;UV to visible wavelengths (3200&#45;6800&#10;AA). We report resolved H3&#45;H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.&#10;Based on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+&#45;1&#10;km/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR&#10;excess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of&#10;the parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+&#45;63 K and radius to 1.5+&#45;0.1&#10;Rj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet&#45;surface shock model&#10;implies a pre&#45;shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,&#45;40) km/s and a pre&#45;shock&#10;density of log(n0/cm^&#45;3)=14(+0,&#45;5). Pre&#45;shock velocity points to a mass of&#10;6(+8,&#45;4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary&#10;Lline&#45;Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of&#10;1.4(+2.8,&#45;0.9)x10^&#45;8 Mj/yr.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12187v1) |&#10;| Qwen2.5&#45;Coder Technical Report | Binyuan Hui, Jian Yang, Zeyu Cui, Jiaxi Yang, Dayiheng Liu, Lei Zhang, Tianyu Liu, Jiajun Zhang, Bowen Yu, Kai Dang, An Yang, Rui Men, Fei Huang, Xingzhang Ren, Xuancheng Ren, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin | &#160;&#160;In this report, we introduce the Qwen2.5&#45;Coder series, a significant upgrade&#10;from its predecessor, CodeQwen1.5. This series includes two models:&#10;Qwen2.5&#45;Coder&#45;1.5B and Qwen2.5&#45;Coder&#45;7B. As a code&#45;specific model,&#10;Qwen2.5&#45;Coder is built upon the Qwen2.5 architecture and continues pretrained&#10;on a vast corpus of over 5.5 trillion tokens. Through meticulous data cleaning,&#10;scalable synthetic data generation, and balanced data mixing, Qwen2.5&#45;Coder&#10;demonstrates impressive code generation capabilities while retaining general&#10;versatility. The model has been evaluated on a wide range of code&#45;related&#10;tasks, achieving state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art (SOTA) performance across more than 10&#10;benchmarks, including code generation, completion, reasoning, and repair,&#10;consistently outperforming larger models of the same model size. We believe&#10;that the release of the Qwen2.5&#45;Coder series will not only push the boundaries&#10;of research in code intelligence but also, through its permissive licensing,&#10;encourage broader adoption by developers in real&#45;world applications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12186v1) |&#10;| Disruption of a massive molecular cloud by a supernova in the Galactic&#10; &#160;Centre: Initial results from the ACES project | M.

Xu | &#160;&#160;The Milky Way&#39;s Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our&#10;local solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions&#10;it exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong&#10;dynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).&#10;Consequently, it is likely that there are large&#45;scale physical structures&#10;within the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we&#10;present new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array&#10;(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a&#10;multi&#45;wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the&#10;M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring&#45;like morphology. We&#10;estimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring to be 79&quot;&#10;and 154&quot;, respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre&#10;distance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $&gt; 10^{4}$ cm$^{&#45;3}$, a&#10;mass of $sim$ $10^6$ M$_odot$, and an expansion speed of $sim$ 20 km&#10;s$^{&#45;1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($&gt; 10^{51}$ erg) and&#10;momentum ($&gt; 10^7$ M$_odot$ km s$^{&#45;1}$). We discuss several possible causes&#10;for the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback&#10;and large&#45;scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the&#10;M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring is a single high&#45;energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain&#10;the observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have&#10;taken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which&#10;we now see as the M0.8$&#45;$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an&#10;extreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12185v1) |&#10;| To CoT or not to CoT?

But for what kinds of&#10;tasks is this extra ``thinking&#39;&#39; really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted&#10;a quantitative meta&#45;analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own&#10;evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives&#10;strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with&#10;much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the&#10;answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the&#10;question or model&#39;s response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic&#10;operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of&#10;CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing&#10;against tool&#45;augmented LLMs. Much of CoT&#39;s gain comes from improving symbolic&#10;execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our&#10;results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance&#10;while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond&#10;prompt&#45;based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation&#10;across the whole range of LLM applications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183v1) |&#10;| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs | Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T. Chiu, Siyu Ren, Fei Yuan, Wenting Zhao, Zhiyong Wu, Alexander M. Rush | &#160;&#160;Broad textual understanding and in&#45;context learning require language models&#10;that utilize full document contexts. Due to the implementation challenges&#10;associated with directly training long&#45;context models, many methods have been&#10;proposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to&#10;differences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these&#10;approaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long&#45;context&#10;performance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a&#10;controlled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation,&#10;utilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several&#10;insights into long&#45;context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of&#10;perplexity as a general&#45;purpose performance indicator even in longer&#45;context&#10;tasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods&#10;systematically underperform across long&#45;context tasks. Finally, we confirm that&#10;exact fine&#45;tuning based methods are generally effective within the range of&#10;their extension, whereas extrapolation remains challenging.

Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate&#10;information that conflicts with real&#45;world facts, and their persuasive style&#10;can make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result,&#10;end&#45;users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with&#10;the accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all&#10;outputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore&#10;supervised finetuning on uncertainty&#45;augmented predictions as a method to&#10;develop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty.&#10;Specifically, we measure the calibration of pre&#45;trained models and then&#10;fine&#45;tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of&#10;uncertainty. Through experiments on various question&#45;answering datasets, we&#10;demonstrate that LLMs are well&#45;calibrated in assessing their predictions, and&#10;supervised finetuning based on the model&#39;s own confidence leads to&#10;well&#45;calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single&#45;claim&#10;answers.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12180v1) |&#10;| Computational Dynamical Systems | Jordan Cotler, Semon Rezchikov | &#160;&#160;We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite&#45;dimensional&#10;dynamical systems. Building off of previous work, we give definitions for what&#10;it means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine. We then&#10;show that &#39;chaotic&#39; dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and&#10;&#39;integrable&#39; dynamical systems (more generally, measure&#45;preserving systems)&#10;cannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines can&#10;be robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, we&#10;show that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable&#10;one&#45;dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and&#10;moreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt.&#10;More broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one &#39;machine&#39; to simulate&#10;another, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low&#45;complexity &#39;encoders&#39; and&#10;&#39;decoders&#39; to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system&#10;being simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical&#10;system leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity&#10;theory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12179v1) |&#10;| Poisson approximate likelihood compared to the particle filter | Yize Hao, Aaron A. Abkemeier, Edward L. Ionides | &#160;&#160;Filtering algorithms are fundamental for inference on partially observed&#10;stochastic dynamic systems, since they provide access to the likelihood&#10;function and hence enable likelihood&#45;based or Bayesian inference. A novel&#10;Poisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.&#10;(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering&#10;a fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of&#10;partially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL&#10;is the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large&#10;improvement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,&#10;based on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.&#10;(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should&#10;use PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence&#10;also reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a&#10;shortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that&#10;the comparison of log&#45;likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al. (2023) is&#10;flawed because their PAL calculations were carried out using a dataset scaled&#10;differently from the previous study. If PAL and the particle filter are applied&#10;to the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears. On simulations&#10;where the model is correctly specified, the particle filter outperforms PAL.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12173v1) |&#10;| You Only Read Once (YORO): Learning to Internalize Database Knowledge&#10; &#160;for Text&#45;to&#45;SQL | Hideo Kobayashi, Wuwei Lan, Peng Shi, Shuaichen Chang, Jiang Guo, Henghui Zhu, Zhiguo Wang, Patrick Ng | &#160;&#160;While significant progress has been made on the text&#45;to&#45;SQL task, recent&#10;solutions repeatedly encode the same database schema for every question,&#10;resulting in unnecessary high inference cost and often overlooking crucial&#10;database knowledge.

YORO significantly reduces the input&#10;token length by 66%&#45;98%. Despite its shorter inputs, our empirical results&#10;demonstrate YORO&#39;s competitive performances with traditional systems on three&#10;benchmarks as well as its significant outperformance on large databases.&#10;Furthermore, YORO excels in handling questions with challenging value&#10;retrievals such as abbreviation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12172v1) |&#10;| Ergodic properties of infinite extension of symmetric interval exchange&#10; &#160;transformations | Przemysław Berk, Frank Trujillo, Hao Wu | &#160;&#160;We prove that skew products with the cocycle given by the function&#10;$f(x)=a(x&#45;1/2)$ with $a&#10;eq 0$ are ergodic for every ergodic symmetric IET in&#10;the base, thus giving the full characterization of ergodic extensions in this&#10;family. Moreover, we prove that under an additional natural assumption of&#10;unique ergodicity on the IET, we can replace $f$ with any differentiable&#10;function with a non&#45;zero sum of jumps.

However,&#10;due to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across&#10;different MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In&#10;this study, we propose a novel Transformer&#45;based framework, multiPI&#45;TransBTS,&#10;which integrates multi&#45;physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.&#10;The model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi&#45;modal&#10;imaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor&#10;characteristics. The multiPI&#45;TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an&#10;Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi&#45;source, multi&#45;scale feature&#10;decoder. The encoder incorporates a multi&#45;branch architecture to separately&#10;extract modality&#45;specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module&#10;fuses information from multiple sources using channel&#45;wise and element&#45;wise&#10;attention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both&#10;common and task&#45;specific features through a Task&#45;Specific Feature Introduction&#10;(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),&#10;Tumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on&#10;the BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of&#10;multiPI&#45;TransBTS over the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methods. The model consistently&#10;achieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,&#10;highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results&#10;also indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision&#10;and recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a&#10;significant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving&#10;clinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12167v1) |&#10;| Synchrotron self&#45;Compton in a radiative&#45;adiabatic fireball scenario:&#10; &#160;Modelling the multiwavelength observations in some Fermi/LAT bursts | Nissim Fraija, P.

Becerra | &#160;&#160;Energetic GeV photons expected from the closest and the most energetic&#10;Gamma&#45;ray bursts (GRBs) provide an unique opportunity to study the&#10;very&#45;high&#45;energy emission as well as the possible correlations with lower&#10;energy bands in realistic GRB afterglow models. In the standard GRB afterglow&#10;model, the relativistic homogeneous shock is usually considered to be fully&#10;adiabatic, however, it could be partially radiative. Based on the external&#10;forward&#45;shock scenario in both stellar wind and constant&#45;density medium. We&#10;present a radiative&#45;adiabatic analytical model of the synchrotron self&#45;Compton&#10;(SSC) and synchrotron processes considering an electron energy distribution&#10;with a power&#45;law index of 1 &lt; p &lt; 2 and 2 $&#10;eq$ p. We show that the SSC&#10;scenario plays a relevant role in the radiative parameter $epsilon$, leading&#10;to a prolonged evolution during the slow cooling regime. In a particular case,&#10;we derive the Fermi/LAT light curves together with the photons with energies&#10;$geq$ 100 MeV in a sample of nine bursts from the second Fermi/LAT GRB catalog&#10;that exhibited temporal and spectral indices with $geq$ 1.5 and $approx$ 2,&#10;respectively. These events can hardly be described with closure relations of&#10;the standard synchrotron afterglow model, and also exhibit energetic photons&#10;above the synchrotron limit. We have modeled the multi&#45;wavelength observations&#10;of our sample to constrain the microphysical parameters, the circumburst&#10;density, the bulk Lorentz factor and the mechanism responsible for explaining&#10;the energetic GeV photons.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12166v1) |&#10;| Blind Deconvolution on Graphs: Exact and Stable Recovery | Chang Ye, Gonzalo Mateos | &#160;&#160;We study a blind deconvolution problem on graphs, which arises in the context&#10;of localizing a few sources that diffuse over networks. While the observations&#10;are bilinear functions of the unknown graph filter coefficients and sparse&#10;input signals, a mild requirement on invertibility of the diffusion filter&#10;enables an efficient convex relaxation leading to a linear programming&#10;formulation that can be tackled with off&#45;the&#45;shelf solvers. Under the&#10;Bernoulli&#45;Gaussian model for the inputs, we derive sufficient exact recovery&#10;conditions in the noise&#45;free setting. A stable recovery result is then&#10;established, ensuring the estimation error remains manageable even when the&#10;observations are corrupted by a small amount of noise. Numerical tests with&#10;synthetic and real&#45;world network data illustrate the merits of the proposed&#10;algorithm, its robustness to noise as well as the benefits of leveraging&#10;multiple signals to aid the (blind) localization of sources of diffusion.

Daniels | &#160;&#160;The Big Data explosion has necessitated the development of search algorithms&#10;that scale sub&#45;linearly in time and memory.&#10; &#160;While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently,&#10;few algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain&#45;specific.&#10; &#160;We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to&#10;perform $k$&#45;NN and $&#13;ho$&#45;NN search on compressed data while only decompressing&#10;a small, relevant, portion of the data.&#10; &#160;panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low&#45;dimensional&#10;structure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.&#10; &#160;panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between&#10;two points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in&#10;terms of the other.&#10; &#160;This property holds for many widely&#45;used distance functions, e.g. string edit&#10;distances (Levenshtein, Needleman&#45;Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures&#10;(Jaccard, Dice, etc.).&#10; &#160;We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic,&#10;and set data.&#10; &#160;We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the&#10;compressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.&#10; &#160;panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering&#10;sub&#45;linear time performance for $k$&#45;NN and $&#13;ho$&#45;NN search.&#10; &#160;We conclude that panCAKES is an efficient, general&#45;purpose algorithm for&#10;exact compressive search on large datasets that obey the manifold hypothesis.&#10; &#160;We provide an open&#45;source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming&#10;language.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12161v1) |&#10;| WeHelp: A Shared Autonomy System for Wheelchair Users | Abulikemu Abuduweili, Alice Wu, Tianhao Wei, Weiye Zhao | &#160;&#160;There is a large population of wheelchair users. Most of the wheelchair users&#10;need help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs&#10;are not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this&#10;project, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair&#10;users. A robot with a WeHelp system has three modes, following mode, remote&#10;control mode and tele&#45;operation mode. In the following mode, the robot follows&#10;the wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can&#10;ask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the&#10;wheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech&#10;recognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode.&#10;In the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy&#10;stick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs,&#10;such as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high&#10;shelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant&#10;takes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks&#10;for their needs. Our evaluation shows that the pipeline is useful and practical&#10;for wheelchair users.

These IFSs&#10;exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are&#10;topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the&#10;Blonder&#45;Tinkham&#45;Klapwijk formalism and considering normal&#45;$d$&#45;wave&#10;superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients&#10;including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and&#10;examine the validation of Widemann&#45;Franz law in the presence of both voltage&#10;and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of&#10;$d$&#45;wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the&#10;normal&#45;superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric&#10;response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in&#10;Seebeck coefficient ($sim 200,mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($sim 3.5$) due to the&#10;generation of the IFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for&#10;device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by&#10;computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice&#45;regularized&#10;version of our continuum model.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12157v1) |&#10;| JEAN: Joint Expression and Audio&#45;guided NeRF&#45;based Talking Face&#10; &#160;Generation | Sai Tanmay Reddy Chakkera, Aggelina Chatziagapi, Dimitris Samaras | &#160;&#160;We introduce a novel method for joint expression and audio&#45;guided talking&#10;face generation. Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker&#10;identity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these&#10;challenges, we propose a NeRF&#45;based network. Since we train our network on&#10;monocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn&#10;disentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio&#10;features in a self&#45;supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects.&#10;By incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned&#10;audio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle&#10;motion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer&#45;based architecture&#10;that learns expression features, capturing long&#45;range facial expressions and&#10;disentangling them from the speech&#45;specific mouth movements. Through&#10;quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can&#10;synthesize high&#45;fidelity talking face videos, achieving state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art facial&#10;expression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12156v1) |&#10;| Autopet III challenge: Incorporating anatomical knowledge into nnUNet&#10; &#160;for lesion segmentation in PET/CT | Hamza Kalisch, Fabian Hörst, Ken Herrmann, Jens Kleesiek, Constantin Seibold | &#160;&#160;Lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging is essential for precise tumor&#10;characterization, which supports personalized treatment planning and enhances&#10;diagnostic precision in oncology. However, accurate manual segmentation of&#10;lesions is time&#45;consuming and prone to inter&#45;observer variability. Given the&#10;rising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods,&#10;particularly deep&#45;learning&#45;based approaches, have become increasingly more&#10;relevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation&#10;of tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting,&#10;addressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable&#10;solutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET&#10;challenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers&#10;(FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers. To this extent, we developed a&#10;classifier that identifies the tracer of the given PET/CT based on the Maximum&#10;Intensity Projection of the PET scan. We trained two individual&#10;nnUNet&#45;ensembles for each tracer where anatomical labels are included as a&#10;multi&#45;label task to enhance the model&#39;s performance. Our final submission&#10;achieves cross&#45;validation Dice scores of 76.90% and 61.33% for the publicly&#10;available FDG and PSMA datasets, respectively.

However, a&#10;robot&#39;s ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if&#10;naively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach&#45;avoid&#10;dynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a&#10;safety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human&#39;s behavior&#10;as goal&#45;driven but conditioned on the robot&#39;s plan, enabling us to capture&#10;influence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical&#10;and belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in&#10;human behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE&#10;(Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high&#45;dimensional&#10;(39&#45;D) simulated human&#45;robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline&#10;game&#45;theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust&#10;baseline that treats the human as a worst&#45;case adversary, a safety controller&#10;that does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy&#45;function&#45;based&#10;safety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage&#10;the influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing&#10;the robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate&#10;during task execution.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12153v1) |&#10;| Decoding Style: Efficient Fine&#45;Tuning of LLMs for Image&#45;Guided Outfit&#10; &#160;Recommendation with Preference | Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan | &#160;&#160;Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding&#10;both fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper&#10;presents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large&#10;language models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their &quot;black box&quot; and static&#10;nature through fine&#45;tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item&#10;visual&#45;textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a&#10;Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style&#10;and color characteristics from human&#45;curated fashion images, forming the basis&#10;for personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine&#45;tuned on the&#10;open&#45;source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability&#10;to recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative&#10;examples is employed to enhance the LLM&#39;s decision&#45;making process. This creates&#10;a self&#45;enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in&#10;line with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore&#10;dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill&#45;in&#45;the&#45;blank,&#10;and complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework&#39;s&#10;ability to generate stylish, trend&#45;aligned outfit suggestions, continuously&#10;improving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our&#10;proposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more&#10;cohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the&#10;proposed framework&#39;s potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate&#10;suggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit&#10;generation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12150v1) |&#10;| Mechanical Wannier&#45;Stark Ladder of Diamond Spin&#45;Mechanical Lamb Wave&#10; &#160;Resonators | Philip Andrango, Hailin Wang | &#160;&#160;We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier&#45;Stark ladders of&#10;diamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with&#10;ultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin&#10;properties. Three nearest&#45;neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric&#10;configurations and a large range of coupling rates have been explored for the&#10;realization of Wannier&#45;Stark ladders of LWRs, potentially enabling long&#45;range&#10;connectivity between spin qubits through their interactions with mechanical&#10;vibrations. Additional analysis on the effects of disorder indicates that the&#10;proposed Wannier&#45;Stark ladder can be robust against realistic experimental&#10;imperfections. The development of mechanical quantum networks of spin qubits&#10;with long&#45;range connectivity can open the door to the implementation of newly&#10;developed quantum low&#45;density parity&#45;check codes in solid&#45;state systems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12149v1) |&#10;| MAgICoRe: Multi&#45;Agent, Iterative, Coarse&#45;to&#45;Fine Refinement for&#10; &#160;Reasoning | Justin Chih&#45;Yao Chen, Archiki Prasad, Swarnadeep Saha, Elias Stengel&#45;Eskin, Mohit Bansal | &#160;&#160;Large Language Models&#39; (LLM) reasoning can be improved using test&#45;time&#10;aggregation strategies, i.e., generating multiple samples and voting among&#10;generated samples. While these improve performance, they often reach a&#10;saturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM&#45;generated&#10;feedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key&#10;challenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can&#10;over&#45;correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and&#10;address errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self&#45;correct and struggle to&#10;identify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding&#10;how many iterations of refinement are needed is non&#45;trivial, and stopping too&#10;soon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose&#10;MAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty&#10;as easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse&#45;grained aggregation and hard&#10;ones with fine&#45;grained and iterative multi&#45;agent refinement. To improve error&#10;localization, we incorporate external step&#45;wise reward model (RM) scores.&#10;Moreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi&#45;agent loop with&#10;three agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on&#10;step&#45;wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure&#10;sufficient refinement, we re&#45;evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating&#10;further rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama&#45;3&#45;8B and GPT&#45;3.5&#10;and show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of&#10;MAgICoRe beats Self&#45;Consistency by 3.4%, Best&#45;of&#45;k by 3.2%, and Self&#45;Refine by&#10;4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with&#10;baselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our&#10;ablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe&#39;s RMs and multi&#45;agent&#10;communication.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147v1) |&#10;| Lempel&#45;Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka | &#160;&#160;Lempel&#45;Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string&#10;processing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into&#10;blocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence&#10;of a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another&#10;occurrence earlier in $T$. Due to numerous applications, LZ77 factorization is&#10;one of the most studied problems on strings. In the 47 years since its&#10;inception, several algorithms were developed for different models of&#10;computation, including parallel, GPU, external&#45;memory, and quantum. Remarkably,&#10;however, the complexity of the most basic variant is still not settled: All&#10;existing algorithms in the RAM model run in $Omega(n)$ time, which is a&#10;$Theta(&#10;og n)$ factor away from the lower bound of $Omega(n/&#10;og n)$&#10;(following from the necessity to read the input, which takes $Theta(n/&#10;og n)$&#10;space for $Tin{0,1}^{n}$).&#10; &#160;We present the first $o(n)$&#45;time algorithm for LZ77 factorization, breaking&#10;the linear&#45;time barrier present for nearly 50 years. For $Tin{0,1}^{n}$, our&#10;algorithm runs in $mathcal{O}(n/sqrt{&#10;og n})=o(n)$ time and uses the optimal&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og n)$ working space. Our algorithm generalizes to&#10;$Sigma=[0..sigma)$, where $sigma=n^{mathcal{O}(1)}$. The runtime and&#10;working space then become $mathcal{O}((n&#10;ogsigma)/sqrt{&#10;og n})$ and&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og_{sigma} n)$. To obtain our algorithm, we prove a more&#10;general result: For any constant $epsilonin(0,1)$ and $Tin[0..sigma)^{n}$,&#10;in $mathcal{O}((n&#10;ogsigma)/sqrt{&#10;og n})$ time and using&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og_{sigma}n)$ space, we can construct an&#10;$mathcal{O}(n/&#10;og_{sigma}n)$&#45;size index that, given any $P=T[j..j+ell)$&#10;(represented as $(j,ell)$), computes the leftmost occurrence of $P$ in $T$ in&#10;$mathcal{O}(&#10;og^{epsilon}n)$ time. In other words, we solve the&#10;indexing/online variant of the LZ77 problem.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12146v1) |&#10;| Experimental Evidence That Conversational Artificial Intelligence Can&#10; &#160;Steer Consumer Behavior Without Detection | Tobias Werner, Ivan Soraperra, Emilio Calvano, David C.

The long&#45;standing goal of&#10;creating a predictive global model for the binding energy of a nucleus remains&#10;a significant challenge, however, and prompts the need for precise measurements&#10;of atomic masses to serve as anchor points for model developments. We present&#10;precise mass measurements of neutron&#45;rich Ru and Pd isotopes performed at the&#10;Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade facility at Argonne National&#10;Laboratory using the Canadian Penning Trap mass spectrometer.

In this&#10;report, we introduce Takin AudioLLM, a series of techniques and models, mainly&#10;including Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, specifically designed for&#10;audiobook production. These models are capable of zero&#45;shot speech production,&#10;generating high&#45;quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human&#10;speech and facilitating individuals to customize the speech content according&#10;to their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec&#10;language model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a&#10;multi&#45;task training framework, capable of generating high&#45;fidelity natural&#10;speech in a zero&#45;shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and&#10;timbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while&#10;advocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its&#10;naturalness and expressiveness.

However, sparse computation challenges&#10;traditional training practices, as discrete expert routing hinders standard&#10;backpropagation and thus gradient&#45;based optimization, which are the cornerstone&#10;of deep learning. To better pursue the scaling power of MoE, we introduce GRIN&#10;(GRadient&#45;INformed MoE training), which incorporates sparse gradient estimation&#10;for expert routing and configures model parallelism to avoid token dropping.&#10;Applying GRIN to autoregressive language modeling, we develop a top&#45;2&#10;16$times$3.8B MoE model. Our model, with only 6.6B activated parameters,&#10;outperforms a 7B dense model and matches the performance of a 14B dense model&#10;trained on the same data.

However, each approach has its own limitations,&#10;making it less effective to rely solely on either one. An emerging and&#10;promising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractive&#10;summarization methods. Despite the plethora of studies in this domain, research&#10;on the combined methodology remains scarce, particularly in the context of&#10;Vietnamese language processing. This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDS&#10;framework leveraging a two&#45;component pipeline architecture that integrates&#10;extractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs an&#10;extractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This is&#10;achieved by a modification of the pre&#45;trained BERT network, which derives&#10;semantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet network&#10;structures. The second component utilizes the VBD&#45;LLaMA2&#45;7B&#45;50b model for&#10;abstractive summarization, ultimately generating the final summary document.&#10;Our proposed framework demonstrates a positive performance, attaining ROUGE&#45;2&#10;scores of 39.6% on the VN&#45;MDS dataset and outperforming the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art&#10;baselines.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12134v1) |&#10;| Einstein&#45;dilaton&#45;four&#45;Maxwell Holographic Anisotropic Models | Irina Ya. Aref&#39;eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov | &#160;&#160;In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the&#10;five&#45;dimensional Einstein&#45;dilaton&#45;Maxwell models has played a crucial role.&#10;Typically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while&#10;additional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A&#10;more general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field&#10;represents spatial longitudinal&#45;transverse anisotropy, while the third and&#10;fourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We&#10;consider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero&#10;temperature and five functions at non&#45;zero temperature. Maxwell field related&#10;to the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,&#10;whereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.&#10;We demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of&#10;the seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations &#45;&#45; either the&#10;dilaton or the vector potential equation &#45;&#45; follows from the Einstein equations&#10;and the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi&#10;identity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress&#45;energy&#10;tensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is&#10;provided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to&#10;three Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis&#10;shows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein&#10;equations and the equation for the vector potential&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12131v1) |&#10;| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components&#10; &#160;for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco&#45;Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram | &#160;&#160;Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data&#10;together with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal&#10;components used. It is therefore important to determine the number of&#10;significant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a&#10;variational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for&#10;estimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of&#10;samples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This&#10;eliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of&#10;principal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.&#10;This framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows&#10;and columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),&#10;and with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data&#10;with arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as&#10;cultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our&#10;method on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may&#10;underestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the&#10;synthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical&#10;dataset. These results suggest that it is broadly applicable across the life&#10;sciences.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12129v1) |&#10;| Linguini: A benchmark for language&#45;agnostic linguistic reasoning | Eduardo Sánchez, Belen Alastruey, Christophe Ropers, Pontus Stenetorp, Mikel Artetxe, Marta R. Costa&#45;jussà | &#160;&#160;We propose a new benchmark to measure a language model&#39;s linguistic reasoning&#10;skills without relying on pre&#45;existing language&#45;specific knowledge. The test&#10;covers 894 questions grouped in 160 problems across 75 (mostly) extremely&#10;low&#45;resource languages, extracted from the International Linguistic Olympiad&#10;corpus. To attain high accuracy on this benchmark, models don&#39;t need previous&#10;knowledge of the tested language, as all the information needed to solve the&#10;linguistic puzzle is presented in the context. We find that, while all analyzed&#10;models rank below 25% accuracy, there is a significant gap between open and&#10;closed models, with the best&#45;performing proprietary model at 24.05% and the&#10;best&#45;performing open model at 8.84%.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12126v1) |&#10;| From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the&#10; &#160;primordial black hole reheating scenario | Guillem Domènech, Jan Tränkle | &#160;&#160;We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs&#10;originate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight&#10;PBHs with masses $M&#10;esssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat&#10;it via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate&#10;whether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH&#10;reheating contains information about the pre&#45;PBH&#45;dominated stage, namely the&#10;initial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer&#10;functions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and&#10;isocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation&#10;of state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH&#10;dominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the&#10;spectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive&#10;to $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density&#10;fluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance&#10;as a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)&#10;observations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the&#10;initial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we&#10;find that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several&#10;future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas,&#10;especially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any&#10;early matter&#45;dominated universe scenario.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12125v1) |&#10;| Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules | Anqi Zhang, Wilson S. Geisler | &#160;&#160;Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We&#10;investigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented&#10;displays having well&#45;separated potential target&#45;object locations. Performance&#10;was compared with the Bayesian&#45;optimal decision process under the assumption&#10;that the information from the different potential target locations is&#10;statistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than&#10;optimal, despite humans&#39; substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the&#10;implausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show&#10;that three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical&#10;results. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near&#10;optimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the&#10;central potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise&#10;causes search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These&#10;findings have far&#45;reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks&#10;and other identification tasks in humans and other animals.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12124v1) |&#10;| Far&#45;from&#45;equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann&#10; &#160;approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows&#10; &#160;$v_n$ | Vincenzo Nugara, Vincenzo Greco, Salvatore Plumari | &#160;&#160;We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal&#10;system in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution&#10;function and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system&#10;sizes $R$ and interaction strength $eta/s$ and identify universality classes&#10;based upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each&#10;of this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $hat&#10;gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results&#10;highlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum&#10;moments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to&#10;a 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of&#10;different sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a&#10;similar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse&#10;flow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system&#10;size and $eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and&#10;their response functions, along with the impact of the $eta/s$ and the system&#10;transverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in&#10;momentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow&#10;$v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of&#10;large opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems&#10;evolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play&#10;in this process.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12123v1) |&#10;| Qwen2.5&#45;Math Technical Report: Toward Mathematical Expert Model via&#10; &#160;Self&#45;Improvement | An Yang, Beichen Zhang, Binyuan Hui, Bofei Gao, Bowen Yu, Chengpeng Li, Dayiheng Liu, Jianhong Tu, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin, Keming Lu, Mingfeng Xue, Runji Lin, Tianyu Liu, Xingzhang Ren, Zhenru Zhang | &#160;&#160;In this report, we present a series of math&#45;specific large language models:&#10;Qwen2.5&#45;Math and Qwen2.5&#45;Math&#45;Instruct&#45;1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the&#10;Qwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self&#45;improvement&#10;throughout the entire pipeline, from pre&#45;training and post&#45;training to&#10;inference: (1) During the pre&#45;training phase, Qwen2&#45;Math&#45;Instruct is utilized&#10;to generate large&#45;scale, high&#45;quality mathematical data. (2) In the&#10;post&#45;training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive&#10;sampling from Qwen2&#45;Math&#45;Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative&#10;evolution of data in supervised fine&#45;tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model,&#10;it&#39;s possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the&#10;next round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the&#10;ultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5&#45;Math&#45;Instruct.&#10;(3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling,&#10;optimizing the model&#39;s performance.&#10; &#160;Qwen2.5&#45;Math&#45;Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced&#10;mathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain&#45;of&#45;Thought (CoT) and&#10;Tool&#45;Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics&#10;datasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and&#10;AIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math&#10;competition problems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12122v1) |&#10;| Computing the $mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two&#45;Dimensional&#10; &#160;Strongly&#45;Correlated Systems | Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn | &#160;&#160;We show that the two&#45;dimensional $mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time&#45;reversal&#10;invariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary&#45;condition&#10;dependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non&#45;interacting and&#10;strongly&#45;correlated insulators. By introducing a family of quasi&#45;single&#10;particle states associated to the many&#45;body ground state of an insulator, we&#10;show that the $mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant can be expressed as the integral of a&#10;certain Berry connection over half the space of boundary conditions, providing&#10;an alternative expression to the formulations that appear in [Lee et al., Phys.&#10;Rev. Lett. $textbf{100}$, 186807 (2008)]. We show the equivalence of the&#10;different many&#45;body formulations of the invariant, and show how they reduce to&#10;known band&#45;theoretic results for Slater determinant ground states. Finally, we&#10;apply our results to analytically calculate the invariant for the Kane&#45;Mele&#10;model with nonlocal (orbital) Hatsugai&#45;Kohmoto (HK) interactions. This&#10;rigorously establishes the topological nontriviality of the Kane&#45;Mele model&#10;with HK interactions, and represents one of the few exact calculations of the&#10;$mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a strongly&#45;interacting system.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12120v1) |&#10;| Weak Lensing analysis of Abell 2390 using short exposures | A. Dutta, J. R. Peterson, T. Rose, M. Cianfaglione, A. Bonafede, G. Li, G. Sembroski | &#160;&#160;We present a weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 2390 at z =&#10;0.23 using second moment shape measurements made in 411 short 60s exposures.&#10;The exposures are obtained in three broadband photometric filters (g, r, i)&#10;using WIYN&#45;ODI. Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a&#10;moment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching&#10;algorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The&#10;measurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight&#10;to obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim&#10;simulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find&#10;the mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We&#10;also find the E&#45;Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic&#10;structures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical&#10;and X&#45;Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to&#10;map large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of&#10;the cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the&#10;peaks are similar to X&#45;Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster&#10;and show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12119v1) |&#10;| Low Frame&#45;rate Speech Codec: a Codec Designed for Fast High&#45;quality&#10; &#160;Speech LLM Training and Inference | Edresson Casanova, Ryan Langman, Paarth Neekhara, Shehzeen Hussain, Jason Li, Subhankar Ghosh, Ante Jukić, Sang&#45;gil Lee | &#160;&#160;Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing&#10;through audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the&#10;application of language modeling techniques to audio data. However, audio&#10;codecs often operate at high frame rates, resulting in slow training and&#10;inference, especially for autoregressive models. To address this challenge, we&#10;present the Low Frame&#45;rate Speech Codec (LFSC): a neural audio codec that&#10;leverages finite scalar quantization and adversarial training with large speech&#10;language models to achieve high&#45;quality audio compression with a 1.89 kbps&#10;bitrate and 21.5 frames per second. We demonstrate that our novel codec can&#10;make the inference of LLM&#45;based text&#45;to&#45;speech models around three times faster&#10;while improving intelligibility and producing quality comparable to previous&#10;models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12117v1) |&#10;| Stronger Baseline Models &#45;&#45; A Key Requirement for Aligning Machine&#10; &#160;Learning Research with Clinical Utility | Nathan Wolfrath, Joel Wolfrath, Hengrui Hu, Anjishnu Banerjee, Anai N. Kothari | &#160;&#160;Machine Learning (ML) research has increased substantially in recent years,&#10;due to the success of predictive modeling across diverse application domains.&#10;However, well&#45;known barriers exist when attempting to deploy ML models in&#10;high&#45;stakes, clinical settings, including lack of model transparency (or the&#10;inability to audit the inference process), large training data requirements&#10;with siloed data sources, and complicated metrics for measuring model utility.&#10;In this work, we show empirically that including stronger baseline models in&#10;healthcare ML evaluations has important downstream effects that aid&#10;practitioners in addressing these challenges. Through a series of case studies,&#10;we find that the common practice of omitting baselines or comparing against a&#10;weak baseline model (e.g. a linear model with no optimization) obscures the&#10;value of ML methods proposed in the research literature. Using these insights,&#10;we propose some best practices that will enable practitioners to more&#10;effectively study and deploy ML models in clinical settings.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12116v1) |&#10;| Revisiting Dark Photon Constraints from CMB Spectral Distortions | Jens Chluba, Bryce Cyr, Matthew C. Johnson | &#160;&#160;Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide&#10;stringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post&#45;BBN (Big&#10;Bang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models&#10;with COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.&#10;Here, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark&#10;photon conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous&#10;works only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the&#10;change to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon&#10;distortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the&#10;distortion has an opposite sign and a $simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We&#10;furthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover&#10;the redshift range $simeq 2times 10^6&#45;4times 10^7$ between the $mu$&#45;era and&#10;the end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints&#10;for dark photon masses in the range $10^{&#45;4},{&#13;m eV}&#10;esssim m_{&#13;m&#10;dp}&#10;esssim 10^{&#45;3},{&#13;m eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We&#10;demonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon&#10;to dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $mu$&#45;type distortion&#10;independent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study&#10;dark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with&#10;CMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12115v1) |&#10;| Bi&#45;objective trail&#45;planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous&#10; &#160;environment | Cory M. Simon, Jeffrey Richley, Lucas Overbey, Darleen Perez&#45;Lavin | &#160;&#160;Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in&#10;resource delivery, patrolling, information&#45;gathering, agriculture, forest fire&#10;fighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and&#10;search&#45;and&#45;rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments &#45;&#45; with e.g.&#10;rough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or&#10;capturing robots &#45;&#45; should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of&#10;risks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should&#10;take the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the&#10;team&#45;level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward&#10;from visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider&#10;bi&#45;objective trail&#45;planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a&#10;hazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed&#10;graph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of&#10;survival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a&#10;robot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for&#10;the Pareto&#45;optimal robot&#45;team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team&#10;objectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive&#10;the mission. A human decision&#45;maker can then select trail plans that balance,&#10;according to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony&#10;optimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto&#45;optimal set of&#10;robot team trail plans. As a case study, we illustrate with an&#10;information&#45;gathering mission in an art museum.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12114v1) |&#10;| Pareto Data Framework: Steps Towards Resource&#45;Efficient Decision Making&#10; &#160;Using Minimum Viable Data (MVD) | Tashfain Ahmed, Josh Siegel | &#160;&#160;This paper introduces the Pareto Data Framework, an approach for identifying&#10;and selecting the Minimum Viable Data (MVD) required for enabling machine&#10;learning applications on constrained platforms such as embedded systems, mobile&#10;devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We demonstrate that strategic&#10;data reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing&#10;bandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies&#10;Minimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource&#45;constrained&#10;environments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient&#10;practices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and&#10;overprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for&#10;optimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data&#10;representation. An experimental methodology demonstrates effective acoustic&#10;data characterization after downsampling, quantization, and truncation to&#10;simulate reduced&#45;fidelity sensors and network and storage constraints; results&#10;shows that performance can be maintained up to 95% with sample rates reduced&#10;by 75% and bit depths and clip length reduced by 50% which translates into&#10;substantial cost and resource reduction. These findings have implications on&#10;the design and development of constrained systems. The paper also discusses&#10;broader implications of the framework, including the potential to democratize&#10;advanced AI technologies across IoT applications and sectors such as&#10;agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing to improve access and multiply&#10;the benefits of data&#45;driven insights.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12112v1) |&#10;| Applications of Knowledge Distillation in Remote Sensing: A Survey | Yassine Himeur, Nour Aburaed, Omar Elharrouss, Iraklis Varlamis, Shadi Atalla, Wathiq Mansoor, Hussain Al Ahmad | &#160;&#160;With the ever&#45;growing complexity of models in the field of remote sensing&#10;(RS), there is an increasing demand for solutions that balance model accuracy&#10;with computational efficiency. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a&#10;powerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,&#10;complex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in&#10;performance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and&#10;its innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer&#10;knowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact&#10;and efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application&#10;across various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and&#10;historical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are&#10;highlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational&#10;efficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical&#10;deployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of&#10;KD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the&#10;breadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case&#10;studies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,&#10;such as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review&#10;discusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical&#10;constraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive&#10;overview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS. Through this&#10;organization, the paper not only elucidates the current state of research in KD&#10;but also sets the stage for future research opportunities, thereby contributing&#10;significantly to both academic research and real&#45;world applications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12111v1) |&#10;| It depends: Varieties of defining growth dependence | Anja Janischewski, Katharina Bohnenberger, Matthias Kranke, Tobias Vogel, Riwan Driouich, Tobias Froese, Stefanie Gerold, Raphael Kaufmann, Lorenz Keyßer, Jannis Niethammer, Christopher Olk, Matthias Schmelzer, Aslı Yürük, Steffen Lange | &#160;&#160;Many socio&#45;economic systems require positive economic growth rates to&#10;function properly. Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing&#10;evidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,&#10;these growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,&#10;more and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth&#45;dependent systems&#10;and develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of&#10;&#39;growth dependence&#39; still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,&#10;which impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article&#10;proposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the&#10;concept of &#39;growth dependence&#39; across socio&#45;economic systems. We provide a&#10;general definition consisting of four components that can be specified for&#10;different empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of&#10;measurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions&#10;or properties of the system under investigation. According to our general&#10;definition, a socio&#45;economic system is growth&#45;dependent if it requires a&#10;long&#45;term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to&#10;maintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen&#10;normative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to&#10;three areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:&#10;employment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies&#10;demonstrate that whether or not a system is growth&#45;dependent hinges not only on&#10;the empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of&#10;the concept of growth dependence. Our framework enables coherent, robust and&#10;effective definitions and research questions, fostering comparability of&#10;findings across different cases and disciplines.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12109v1) |&#10;| SPRMamba: Surgical Phase Recognition for Endoscopic Submucosal&#10; &#160;Dissection with Mamba | Xiangning Zhang, Jinnan Chen, Qingwei Zhang, Chengfeng Zhou, Zhengjie Zhang, Xiaobo Li, Dahong Qian | &#160;&#160;Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive procedure&#10;initially designed for the treatment of early gastric cancer but is now widely&#10;used for various gastrointestinal lesions. Computer&#45;assisted Surgery systems&#10;have played a crucial role in improving the precision and safety of ESD&#10;procedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognition&#10;of surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesion&#10;characteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real&#45;time&#10;surgical phase recognition algorithms. Existing surgical phase recognition&#10;algorithms struggle to efficiently capture temporal contexts in video&#45;based&#10;scenarios, leading to insufficient performance. To address these issues, we&#10;propose SPRMamba, a novel Mamba&#45;based framework for ESD surgical phase&#10;recognition. SPRMamba leverages the strengths of Mamba for long&#45;term temporal&#10;modeling while introducing the Scaled Residual TranMamba block to enhance the&#10;capture of fine&#45;grained details, overcoming the limitations of traditional&#10;temporal models like Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformers.&#10;Moreover, a Temporal Sample Strategy is introduced to accelerate the&#10;processing, which is essential for real&#45;time phase recognition in clinical&#10;settings. Extensive testing on the ESD385 dataset and the cholecystectomy&#10;Cholec80 dataset demonstrates that SPRMamba surpasses existing state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art&#10;methods and exhibits greater robustness across various surgical phase&#10;recognition tasks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12108v1) |&#10;| Who&#39;s the GOAT?

In this work, we design a&#10;data&#45;driven random walk on the symmetric group to obtain a stationary&#10;distribution over player rankings, spanning across different time periods in&#10;sports history. We combine this distribution with a notion of stochastic&#10;dominance to obtain a partial order over the players.

We begin by fine&#45;tuning an LLM for&#10;accurate perception&#45;level value measurement and verifying the capability of&#10;LLMs to parse texts into perceptions, forming the core of the GPV pipeline.&#10;Applying GPV to human&#45;authored blogs, we demonstrate its stability, validity,&#10;and superiority over prior psychological tools. Then, extending GPV to LLM&#10;value measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometric&#10;methodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free&#45;form&#10;outputs, enabling context&#45;specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis of&#10;measurement paradigms, indicating response biases of prior methods; and 3) an&#10;attempt to bridge LLM values and their safety, revealing the predictive power&#10;of different value systems and the impacts of various values on LLM safety.&#10;Through interdisciplinary efforts, we aim to leverage AI for next&#45;generation&#10;psychometrics and psychometrics for value&#45;aligned AI.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12106v1) |&#10;| FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated&#10; &#160;Long&#45;Tailed Learning | Xiuhua Lu, Peng Li, Xuefeng Jiang | &#160;&#160;Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy&#10;in distributed machine learning. However, datasets distributed across each&#10;client in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can&#10;be globally aggregated, they tend to be long&#45;tailed distributed, which greatly&#10;affects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated&#10;learning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it&#10;fails to address the phenomenon of class&#45;wise bias in global long&#45;tailed data.&#10;This results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting&#10;the equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a&#10;methodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,&#10;we propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the&#10;local training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred&#10;optimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art&#10;methods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long&#45;tailed&#10;distribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR&#45;10&#45;LT and&#10;CIFAR&#45;100&#45;LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of&#10;model performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long&#45;tailed&#10;distribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12105v1) |&#10;| Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error&#10; &#160;Detection | Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia | &#160;&#160;Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real&#45;world applications. Doing&#10;so requires overcoming the noise present on today&#39;s hardware. The quantum&#10;approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling&#10;up due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup&#10;over state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art classical algorithms for some problems. However,&#10;achieving better&#45;than&#45;classical performance with QAOA is believed to require&#10;fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault&#45;tolerant&#10;implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg&#39;&#39; error detection&#10;code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the&#10;algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with&#10;up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped&#45;ion quantum computer. Additionally, we&#10;propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance, and use it&#10;to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance&#10;to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our&#10;model can be used to determine necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform&#10;Goemans&#45;Williamson algorithm on future hardware. Our results demonstrate the&#10;largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially&#10;fault&#45;tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date,&#10;paving the way towards solving real&#45;world applications with quantum computers.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12104v1) |&#10;| Cyclicity Analysis of the Ornstein&#45;Uhlenbeck Process | Vivek Kaushik | &#160;&#160;In this thesis, we consider an $N$&#45;dimensional Ornstein&#45;Uhlenbeck (OU)&#10;process satisfying the linear stochastic differential equation $dmathbf x(t) =&#10;&#45; mathbf Bmathbf x(t) dt + boldsymbol Sigma d mathbf w(t).$ Here, $mathbf&#10;B$ is a fixed $N times N$ circulant friction matrix whose eigenvalues have&#10;positive real parts, $boldsymbol Sigma$ is a fixed $N times M$ matrix. We&#10;consider a signal propagation model governed by this OU process. In this model,&#10;an underlying signal propagates throughout a network consisting of $N$ linked&#10;sensors located in space. We interpret the $n$&#45;th component of the OU process&#10;as the measurement of the propagating effect made by the $n$&#45;th sensor. The&#10;matrix $mathbf B$ represents the sensor network structure: if $mathbf B$ has&#10;first row $(b_1 &#160;, &#160;dots &#160;, &#160;b_N),$ where $b_1&gt;0$ and $b_2 &#160;, &#160;dots , b_N &#10;e 0,$ then the magnitude of $b_p$ quantifies how receptive the $n$&#45;th&#10;sensor is to activity within the $(n+p&#45;1)$&#45;th sensor. Finally, the $(m,n)$&#45;th&#10;entry of the matrix $mathbf D = frac{boldsymbol Sigma boldsymbol&#10;Sigma^text T}{2}$ is the covariance of the component noises injected into the&#10;$m$&#45;th and $n$&#45;th sensors. For different choices of $mathbf B$ and&#10;$boldsymbol Sigma,$ we investigate whether Cyclicity Analysis enables us to&#10;recover the structure of network. Roughly speaking, Cyclicity Analysis studies&#10;the lead&#45;lag dynamics pertaining to the components of a multivariate signal. We&#10;specifically consider an $N times N$ skew&#45;symmetric matrix $mathbf Q,$ known&#10;as the lead matrix, in which the sign of its $(m,n)$&#45;th entry captures the&#10;lead&#45;lag relationship between the $m$&#45;th and $n$&#45;th component OU processes. We&#10;investigate whether the structure of the leading eigenvector of $mathbf Q,$&#10;the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of $mathbf Q$ in&#10;modulus, reflects the network structure induced by $mathbf B.$&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12102v1) |&#10;| Symmetry&#45;Enriched Learning: A Category&#45;Theoretic Framework for Robust&#10; &#160;Machine Learning Models | Ronald Katende | &#160;&#160;This manuscript presents a novel framework that integrates higher&#45;order&#10;symmetries and category theory into machine learning. We introduce new&#10;mathematical constructs, including hyper&#45;symmetry categories and functorial&#10;representations, to model complex transformations within learning algorithms.&#10;Our contributions include the design of symmetry&#45;enriched learning models, the&#10;development of advanced optimization techniques leveraging categorical&#10;symmetries, and the theoretical analysis of their implications for model&#10;robustness, generalization, and convergence. Through rigorous proofs and&#10;practical applications, we demonstrate that incorporating higher&#45;dimensional&#10;categorical structures enhances both the theoretical foundations and practical&#10;capabilities of modern machine learning algorithms, opening new directions for&#10;research and innovation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12100v1) |&#10;| Brain&#45;Streams: fMRI&#45;to&#45;Image Reconstruction with Multi&#45;modal Guidance | Jaehoon Joo, Taejin Jeong, Seongjae Hwang | &#160;&#160;Understanding how humans process visual information is one of the crucial&#10;steps for unraveling the underlying mechanism of brain activity. Recently, this&#10;curiosity has motivated the fMRI&#45;to&#45;image reconstruction task; given the fMRI&#10;data from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual&#10;stimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent&#10;Diffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex&#10;visual stimuli such as high&#45;resolution natural images from vision datasets.&#10;Despite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often&#10;lack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.&#10;Consequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere&#10;visuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs&#10;effectively incorporate multi&#45;modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,&#10;and image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image&#10;generations. Specifically, inspired by the two&#45;streams hypothesis suggesting&#10;that perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain&#10;regions, our framework, Brain&#45;Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain&#10;regions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from&#10;semantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information&#10;regions, Brain&#45;Streams provides accurate multi&#45;modal guidance to LDMs. We&#10;validate the reconstruction ability of Brain&#45;Streams both quantitatively and&#10;qualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI&#10;data.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12099v1) |&#10;| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal&#10; &#160;execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huyên Pham | &#160;&#160;Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and&#10;constraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity&#10;markets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general&#10;propagator model under linear functional inequality constraints. The optimal&#10;control is given explicitly in terms of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers&#10;and their conditional expectations, as a solution to a linear stochastic&#10;Fredholm equation. We propose a stochastic version of the Uzawa algorithm on&#10;the dual problem to construct the stochastic Lagrange multipliers numerically&#10;via a stochastic projected gradient ascent, combined with a least&#45;squares Monte&#10;Carlo regression step to approximate their conditional expectations. We&#10;illustrate our findings on two different practical applications with stochastic&#10;signals: (i) an optimal execution problem with an exponential or a power law&#10;decaying transient impact, with either a `no&#45;shorting&#39; constraint in the&#10;presence of a `sell&#39; signal, a `no&#45;buying&#39; constraint in the presence of a&#10;`buy&#39; signal or a stochastic `stop&#45;trading&#39; constraint whenever the exogenous&#10;price drops below a specified reference level; (ii) a battery storage problem&#10;with instantaneous operating costs, seasonal signals and fixed constraints on&#10;both the charging power and the load capacity of the battery.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12098v1) |&#10;| Skill matching at scale: freelancer&#45;project alignment for efficient&#10; &#160;multilingual candidate retrieval | Warren Jouanneau, Marc Palyart, Emma Jouffroy | &#160;&#160;Finding the perfect match between a job proposal and a set of freelancers is&#10;not an easy task to perform at scale, especially in multiple languages. In this&#10;paper, we propose a novel neural retriever architecture that tackles this&#10;problem in a multilingual setting. Our method encodes project descriptions and&#10;freelancer profiles by leveraging pre&#45;trained multilingual language models. The&#10;latter are used as backbone for a custom transformer architecture that aims to&#10;keep the structure of the profiles and project. This model is trained with a&#10;contrastive loss on historical data. Thanks to several experiments, we show&#10;that this approach effectively captures skill matching similarity and&#10;facilitates efficient matching, outperforming traditional methods.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12097v2) |&#10;| An Efficient Projection&#45;Based Next&#45;best&#45;view Planning Framework for&#10; &#160;Reconstruction of Unknown Objects | Zhizhou Jia, Shaohui Zhang, Qun Hao | &#160;&#160;Efficiently and completely capturing the three&#45;dimensional data of an object&#10;is a fundamental problem in industrial and robotic applications. The task of&#10;next&#45;best&#45;view (NBV) planning is to infer the pose of the next viewpoint based&#10;on the current data, and gradually realize the complete three&#45;dimensional&#10;reconstruction. Many existing algorithms, however, suffer a large computational&#10;burden due to the use of ray&#45;casting. To address this, this paper proposes a&#10;projection&#45;based NBV planning framework. It can select the next best view at an&#10;extremely fast speed while ensuring the complete scanning of the object.&#10;Specifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into&#10;ellipsoids based on the voxel structure.Then, the next best view is selected&#10;from the candidate views using a projection&#45;based viewpoint quality evaluation&#10;function in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy. This process&#10;replaces the ray&#45;casting in voxel structures, significantly improving the&#10;computational efficiency. Comparative experiments with other algorithms in a&#10;simulation environment show that the framework proposed in this paper can&#10;achieve 10 times efficiency improvement on the basis of capturing roughly the&#10;same coverage. The real&#45;world experimental results also prove the efficiency&#10;and feasibility of the framework.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12096v1) |&#10;| Undersampling effects on observed periods of coronal oscillations | Daye Lim, Tom Van Doorsselaere, Valery M. Nakariakov, Dmitrii Y. Kolotkov, Yuhang Gao, David Berghmans | &#160;&#160;Context. Recent observations of decayless transverse oscillations have shown&#10;two branches in the relationship between periods and loop lengths. One is a&#10;linear relationship, interpreted as a standing mode. The other shows almost no&#10;correlation and has not yet been interpreted conclusively. Aims. We&#10;investigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless&#10;oscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely&#10;follow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations&#10;are standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations&#10;where the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase&#10;are randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal&#10;by considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of&#10;telescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast&#10;Fourier transform. Results. When the sampling cadence is getting closer to the&#10;actual oscillation period, a tendency for overestimating periods in short loops&#10;is enhanced. The relationship between loop lengths and periods of the sampled&#10;signals shows the two branches as in the observation. Conclusions. We find that&#10;long periods of decayless oscillations occurring in short loops could be the&#10;result of undersampling.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12095v1) |&#10;| Enwrapped Perylene Bisimide Enables Room Temperature Polariton Lasing&#10; &#160;and Photonic Lattices | Dominik Horneber, Johannes Düreth, Tim Schembri, Simon Betzold, Matthias Stolte, Sven Höfling, Frank Würthner, Sebastian Klembt | &#160;&#160;Perylene bisimides (PBIs) are organic dyes with photoluminescence quantum&#10;yields (PLQY) close to unity in solution and great thermal and photo&#45;chemical&#10;stability. These features alongside the tunability of their solid&#45;state packing&#10;arrangement via chemical functionalization make this material class an&#10;excellent candidate for exciton&#45;polariton lasing at room temperature. Polariton&#10;lasing is well understood in III&#45;V semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures,&#10;however, the search for emitter materials for robust and versatile room&#10;temperature applications is ongoing. While e.g. perovskites and several organic&#10;materials have been identified to support polariton lasing, many of these&#10;materials lack tunability and long&#45;term stability under ambient conditions.&#10;Here, we fabricate optical microcavities using a strongly enwrapped PBI&#10;chromophore with prevailing monomer&#45;like absorption and emission properties in&#10;the solid state. Voluminous bay&#45;substituents prevent stacking induced&#10;PLQY&#45;quenching, thereby enabling polariton lasing at room temperature.&#10;Additionally, photonic confinement in single hemispheric resonators is&#10;demonstrated leading to localized polaritonic modes with discrete energies, as&#10;well as optical lattices revealing distinct polaritonic band&#45;structures. Due to&#10;the possibility of tunable properties by the precise control of the solid&#45;state&#10;packing arrangement of PBI emitters, our results pave the way for&#10;polarization&#45;dependent light&#45;matter coupling, including topological photonic&#10;effects within oriented crystalline thin&#45;film microcavity structures.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12093v1) |&#10;| IMRL: Integrating Visual, Physical, Temporal, and Geometric&#10; &#160;Representations for Enhanced Food Acquisition | Rui Liu, Zahiruddin Mahammad, Amisha Bhaskar, Pratap Tokekar | &#160;&#160;Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality&#10;of life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse&#10;food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents&#10;unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface&#45;level geometric&#10;information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g.,&#10;color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially&#10;when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance.&#10;We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition.&#10;Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy&#10;based on off&#45;the&#45;shelf image encoders such as ResNet&#45;50. However, such&#10;representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse&#10;acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel&#10;approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi&#45;Dimensional Representation Learning), which&#10;integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance&#10;the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach&#10;captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi&#45;solid, granular,&#10;liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and&#10;introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and&#10;assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies&#10;based on context, improving the robot&#39;s capability to handle diverse food&#10;acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach&#39;s&#10;robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations,&#10;including zero&#45;shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves&#10;improvement up to $35%$ in success rate compared with the best&#45;performing&#10;baseline.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12092v1) |&#10;| Uncovering liquid&#45;substrate fluctuation effects on crystal growth and&#10; &#160;disordered hyperuniformity of two&#45;dimensional materials | S. K. Mkhonta, Zhi&#45;Feng Huang, K. R. Elder | &#160;&#160;We investigate the growth of two&#45;dimensional (2D) crystals on fluctuating&#10;surfaces using a phase field crystal model that is relevant on atomic length&#10;and diffusive time scales. Motivated by recent experiments which achieved&#10;unprecedented fast growth of large&#45;size high&#45;quality 2D crystals on liquid&#10;substrates, we uncover novel effects of liquid surfaces on microstructural&#10;ordering. We find that substrate fluctuations generate short&#45;ranged noise that&#10;speeds up crystallization and grain growth of the overlayer, surpassing that of&#10;free&#45;standing system. Coupling to the liquid substrate fluctuations can also&#10;modulate local randomness, leading to intriguing disordered structures with&#10;hidden spatial order, i.e., disordered hyperuniformity. These results reveal&#10;the physical mechanisms underlying the fast growth of 2D crystals on liquid&#10;surfaces and demonstrate a novel strategy for synthesizing disordered&#10;hyperuniform thin film structures.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12090v1) |&#10;| The Impact of Element Ordering on LM Agent Performance | Wayne Chi, Ameet Talwalkar, Chris Donahue | &#160;&#160;There has been a surge of interest in language model agents that can navigate&#10;virtual environments such as the web or desktop. To navigate such environments,&#10;agents benefit from information on the various elements (e.g., buttons, text,&#10;or images) present. It remains unclear which element attributes have the&#10;greatest impact on agent performance, especially in environments that only&#10;provide a graphical representation (i.e., pixels). Here we find that the&#10;ordering in which elements are presented to the language model is surprisingly&#10;impactful&#45;&#45;randomizing element ordering in a webpage degrades agent performance&#10;comparably to removing all visible text from an agent&#39;s state representation.&#10;While a webpage provides a hierarchical ordering of elements, there is no such&#10;ordering when parsing elements directly from pixels. Moreover, as tasks become&#10;more challenging and models more sophisticated, our experiments suggest that&#10;the impact of ordering increases. Finding an effective ordering is non&#45;trivial.&#10;We investigate the impact of various element ordering methods in web and&#10;desktop environments. We find that dimensionality reduction provides a viable&#10;ordering for pixel&#45;only environments. We train a UI element detection model to&#10;derive elements from pixels and apply our findings to an agent&#10;benchmark&#45;&#45;OmniACT&#45;&#45;where we only have access to pixels. Our method completes&#10;more than two times as many tasks on average relative to the previous&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12089v2) |&#10;| Quark saturation in the QCD phase diagram | Marcus Bluhm, Yuki Fujimoto, Larry McLerran, Marlene Nahrgang | &#160;&#160;We determine the onset of Quarkyonic Matter corresponding to values of&#10;temperature and baryon chemical potential at which the quark phase space&#10;density becomes one. At zero temperature for baryon chemical potentials below&#10;the mass of the Lambda baryon, only nucleons contribute to the quark density.&#10;This is different at finite temperature, where all baryons, mesons and their&#10;resonances can be excited and thus add quarks to the phase space. The&#10;probability density to find a quark inside a hadron is determined using the&#10;Yukawa ansatz of the IdylliQ model of Quarkyonic Matter. We estimate separately&#10;the magnitude of the various contributions of nucleons, Delta baryons, pions as&#10;well as further hadrons and resonances. The uncertainty in the parametrization&#10;of the probability density to find a quark inside a nucleon is spanned by&#10;assuming that at zero temperature the transition density to Quarkyonic Matter&#10;is between one and three times that of nuclear matter. Various predictions for&#10;a possible critical point associated with the chiral phase transition are found&#10;close to a triple point at which the line of the deconfinement transition and&#10;the curve associated with the transition to Quarkyonic Matter intersect. These&#10;considerations provide an estimate for the region in the QCD phase diagram&#10;where Quarkyonic Matter may be found.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12088v1) |&#10;| Towards Interpretable End&#45;Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Prediction:&#10; &#160;Utilizing Administrative Claims Data with Explainable AI Techniques | Yubo Li, Saba Al&#45;Sayouri, Rema Padman | &#160;&#160;This study explores the potential of utilizing administrative claims data,&#10;combined with advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, to&#10;predict the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to End&#45;Stage Renal&#10;Disease (ESRD). We analyze a comprehensive, 10&#45;year dataset provided by a major&#10;health insurance organization to develop prediction models for multiple&#10;observation windows using traditional machine learning methods such as Random&#10;Forest and XGBoost as well as deep learning approaches such as Long Short&#45;Term&#10;Memory (LSTM) networks.

We further apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to&#10;enhance interpretability, providing insights into the impact of individual&#10;features on predictions at the individual patient level.

Over the past decade, numerous endeavours have been undertaken in&#10;the literature to develop methods for efficiently distinguishing boosted top&#10;quark jets from QCD jets. Although cut&#45;based strategies for boosted top&#10;tagging, which rely on substructure information from fat jets resulting from&#10;the hadronic decay of boosted top quarks, were introduced in the literature as&#10;early as 2008, recent years have witnessed a surge in the utilization of&#10;machine learning&#45;based approaches for the classification of top&#45;jets from QCD&#10;jets.

However, the computational&#10;complexity of mixed&#45;integer MPC still poses a significant challenge,&#10;particularly in large&#45;scale applications. This study proposes an approach to&#10;enhance the computational efficiency of mixed&#45;integer MPC&#45;based irrigation&#10;schedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture&#10;dynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed&#45;integer linear&#10;representation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the&#10;mixed&#45;integer MPC&#45;based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a&#10;mixed&#45;integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed&#45;integer&#10;nonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global&#10;optimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated&#10;through comparative studies conducted on a large&#45;scale agricultural field&#10;across two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models,&#10;specifically Long Short&#45;Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used&#10;triggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU&#45;based approach significantly&#10;reduces solution times &#45;&#45; by up to 99.5% &#45;&#45; while achieving comparable&#10;performance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water&#10;Use Efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, the ReLU&#45;based approach maintains enhanced&#10;performance in terms of total prescribed irrigation and IWUE compared to the&#10;widely&#45;used triggered irrigation scheduling method.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12082v1) |&#10;| Design of Ligand&#45;Binding Proteins with Atomic Flow Matching | Junqi Liu, Shaoning Li, Chence Shi, Zhi Yang, Jian Tang | &#160;&#160;Designing novel proteins that bind to small molecules is a long&#45;standing&#10;challenge in computational biology, with applications in developing catalysts,&#10;biosensors, and more. Current computational methods rely on the assumption that&#10;the binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible,&#10;as conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon&#10;binding. In this work, we formulate proteins and molecules as unified&#10;biotokens, and present AtomFlow, a novel deep generative model under the&#10;flow&#45;matching framework for the design of ligand&#45;binding proteins from the 2D&#10;target molecular graph alone. Operating on representative atoms of biotokens,&#10;AtomFlow captures the flexibility of ligands and generates ligand conformations&#10;and protein backbone structures iteratively. We consider the multi&#45;scale nature&#10;of biotokens and demonstrate that AtomFlow can be effectively trained on a&#10;subset of structures from the Protein Data Bank, by matching flow vector field&#10;using an SE(3) equivariant structure prediction network. Experimental results&#10;show that our method can generate high fidelity ligand&#45;binding proteins and&#10;achieve performance comparable to the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art model RFDiffusionAA,&#10;while not requiring bound ligand structures. As a general framework, AtomFlow&#10;holds the potential to be applied to various biomolecule generation tasks in&#10;the future.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12080v1) |&#10;| Denoising diffusion models for high&#45;resolution microscopy image&#10; &#160;restoration | Pamela Osuna&#45;Vargas, Maren H. Wehrheim, Lucas Zinz, Johanna Rahm, Ashwin Balakrishnan, Alexandra Kaminer, Mike Heilemann, Matthias Kaschube | &#160;&#160;Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at&#10;the nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological&#10;organization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of&#10;fluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses&#10;remain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced&#10;laser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and&#10;increased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a&#10;denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high&#45;resolution&#10;images by conditioning the model on low&#45;resolution information. Additionally,&#10;the probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images&#10;that tend to further increase the signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio. We show that our model&#10;achieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously&#10;best&#45;performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly,&#10;while any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but&#10;not all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all&#10;four data sets, suggesting high generalizability.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12078v1) |&#10;| Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Via Data Pruning | Andrea Napoli, Paul White | &#160;&#160;The removal of carefully&#45;selected examples from training data has recently&#10;emerged as an effective way of improving the robustness of machine learning&#10;models. However, the best way to select these examples remains an open&#10;question. In this paper, we consider the problem from the perspective of&#10;unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). We propose AdaPrune, a method for UDA&#10;whereby training examples are removed to attempt to align the training&#10;distribution to that of the target data. By adopting the maximum mean&#10;discrepancy (MMD) as the criterion for alignment, the problem can be neatly&#10;formulated and solved as an integer quadratic program. We evaluate our approach&#10;on a real&#45;world domain shift task of bioacoustic event detection. As a method&#10;for UDA, we show that AdaPrune outperforms related techniques, and is&#10;complementary to other UDA algorithms such as CORAL. Our analysis of the&#10;relationship between the MMD and model accuracy, along with t&#45;SNE plots,&#10;validate the proposed method as a principled and well&#45;founded way of performing&#10;data pruning.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12076v1) |&#10;| The elastica sling | Alessandro Cazzolli, Francesco Dal Corso | &#160;&#160;The nonlinear mechanics of a flexible elastic rod constrained at its edges by&#10;a pair of sliding sleeves is analyzed. The planar equilibrium configurations of&#10;this variable&#45;length elastica are found to have shape defined only by the&#10;inclination of the two constraints, while their distance is responsible only&#10;for scaling the size. By extending the theoretical stability criterion&#10;available for systems under isoperimetric constraints to the case of variable&#10;domains, the existence of no more than one stable equilibrium solution is&#10;revealed. The set of sliding sleeves&#39; inclination pairs for which the stability&#10;is lost are identified. Such critical conditions allow the indefinite ejection&#10;of the flexible rod from the sliding sleeves, thus realizing an elastica sling.&#10;Finally, the theoretical findings are validated by experiments on a physical&#10;prototype. The present results lead to a novel actuation principle that may&#10;find application as a mechanism in energy harvesting, wave mitigation devices,&#10;and soft robotic locomotion.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12075v1) |&#10;| Online Refractive Camera Model Calibration in Visual Inertial Odometry | Mohit Singh, Kostas Alexis | &#160;&#160;This paper presents a general refractive camera model and online&#10;co&#45;estimation of odometry and the refractive index of unknown media. This&#10;enables operation in diverse and varying refractive fluids, given only the&#10;camera calibration in air. The refractive index is estimated online as a state&#10;variable of a monocular visual&#45;inertial odometry framework in an iterative&#10;formulation using the proposed camera model. The method was verified on data&#10;collected using an underwater robot traversing inside a pool. The evaluations&#10;demonstrate convergence to the ideal refractive index for water despite&#10;significant perturbations in the initialization. Simultaneously, the approach&#10;enables on&#45;par visual&#45;inertial odometry performance in refractive media without&#10;prior knowledge of the refractive index or requirement of medium&#45;specific&#10;camera calibration.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12074v1) |&#10;| Influence of dislocations in multilayer graphene stacks: A phase field&#10; &#160;crystal study | K. R. Elder, Zhi&#45;Feng Huang, T. Ala&#45;Nissila | &#160;&#160;In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene&#10;stacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a&#10;recently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems&#10;incorporating out&#45;of&#45;plane deformations and parameterized to match to density&#10;functional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems. The&#10;specific configuration considered consists of one monolayer containing four&#10;$5|7$ dislocations (i.e., two dislocation dipoles) sandwiched in between&#10;perfect graphene layers. The study reveals how the strain field from the&#10;dislocations in the defected layer leads to out&#45;of&#45;plane deformations that in&#10;turn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are&#10;made for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a&#10;defect&#45;free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and&#10;system size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by&#10;roughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence&#10;across the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height&#10;profiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12073v1) |&#10;| PAD&#45;FT: A Lightweight Defense for Backdoor Attacks via Data Purification&#10; &#160;and Fine&#45;Tuning | Yukai Xu, Yujie Gu, Kouichi Sakurai | &#160;&#160;Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks,&#10;particularly as recent advancements have led to increasingly subtle&#10;implantation, making the defense more challenging. Existing defense mechanisms&#10;typically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and&#10;involve retraining an auxiliary model or fine&#45;tuning the entire victim model.&#10;However, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always&#10;feasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and&#10;lightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD&#45;FT, that does not require an&#10;additional clean dataset and fine&#45;tunes only a very small part of the model to&#10;disinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a&#10;simple data purification process to identify and select the most&#45;likely clean&#10;data from the poisoned training dataset. The self&#45;purified clean dataset is&#10;then used for activation clipping and fine&#45;tuning only the last classification&#10;layer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation&#10;clipping, and classifier fine&#45;tuning, our mechanism PAD&#45;FT demonstrates&#10;superior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as&#10;confirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12072v1) |&#10;| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing&#10; &#160;data in Irish sagas | P. MacCarron | &#160;&#160;For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts&#10;in order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify&#10;similarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the&#10;significance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture&#10;requires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and&#10;often impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the&#10;network of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that&#10;the top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent&#10;with central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has&#10;been lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust&#10;to a large random removal of edges.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12071v1) |&#10;| The repetition threshold for ternary rich words | James D. Currie, Lucas Mol, Jarkko Peltomäki | &#160;&#160;In 2014, Vesti proposed the problem of determining the repetition threshold&#10;for infinite rich words, i.e., for infinite words in which all factors of&#10;length $n$ contain $n$ distinct nonempty palindromic factors. In 2020, Currie,&#10;Mol, and Rampersad proved a conjecture of Baranwal and Shallit that the&#10;repetition threshold for binary rich words is $2 + sqrt{2}/2$. In this paper,&#10;we prove a structure theorem for $16/7$&#45;power&#45;free ternary rich words. Using&#10;the structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich&#10;words is $1 + 1/(3 &#45; mu) approx 2.25876324$, where $mu$ is the unique real&#10;root of the polynomial $x^3 &#45; 2x^2 &#45; 1$.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12068v1) |&#10;| Fitting Multilevel Factor Models | Tetiana Parshakova, Trevor Hastie, Stephen Boyd | &#160;&#160;We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance&#10;given by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~cite{parshakova2023factor}. We&#10;develop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation&#45;maximization (EM)&#10;algorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of&#10;the observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and&#10;maintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved&#10;through a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive&#10;definite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of an invertible PSD MLR matrix&#10;is also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the&#10;recursive Sherman&#45;Morrison&#45;Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of&#10;the inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky&#10;factorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities,&#10;yielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement. This paper is&#10;accompanied by an open&#45;source package that implements the proposed methods.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12067v1) |&#10;| Drifts of the sub&#45;stellar points of the TRAPPIST&#45;1 planets | Revol Alexandre, Émeline Bolmont, Mariana Sastre, Gabriel Tobie, Anne&#45;Sophie Libert, Mathilde Kervazo, Sergi Blanco&#45;Cuaresma | &#160;&#160;Accurate modeling of tidal interactions is crucial for interpreting recent&#10;JWST observations of the thermal emissions of TRAPPIST&#45;1~b and c and for&#10;characterizing the surface conditions and potential habitability of the other&#10;planets in the system. Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by&#10;tidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to&#10;their proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the&#10;TRAPPIST&#45;1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In&#10;this work, we present the recent implementation of the co&#45;planar tidal torque&#10;and forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N&#45;body code&#10;Posidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using&#10;a tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of&#10;each planet by taking into account their multi&#45;layer internal structure&#10;computed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST&#45;1 planets&#10;are not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state.&#10;Planet&#45;planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and&#10;tides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a&#10;result, the sub&#45;stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and&#10;long&#45;timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with&#10;periods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12065v1) |&#10;| Quantum Magic and Multi&#45;Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei | Florian Brökemeier, S. Momme Hengstenberg, James W. T. Keeble, Caroline E. P. Robin, Federico Rocco, Martin J. Savage | &#160;&#160;Motivated by the Gottesman&#45;Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the&#10;quantum complexity of $p$&#45;shell and $sd$&#45;shell nuclei. Valence&#45;space nuclear&#10;shell&#45;model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit&#10;registers using the Jordan&#45;Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$&#45;shell and 24&#10;qubits for the $sd$&#45;shell), from which measures of the many&#45;body entanglement&#10;($n$&#45;tangles) and magic (non&#45;stabilizerness) are determined. While exact&#10;evaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of&#10;active nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex&#10;nuclei. The broadly&#45;applicable Pauli&#45;String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe&#45;) MCMC technique&#10;is introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed&#10;nuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $sim 8$ for some&#10;nuclei. Significant multi&#45;nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$&#45;shell,&#10;dominated by proton&#45;neutron configurations, along with significant measures of&#10;magic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on&#10;the path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion.&#10;These results indicate that quantum&#45;computing resources will accelerate&#10;precision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12064v1) |&#10;| Post&#45;Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a&#10; &#160;massive, rotating object | Lorenzo Iorio | &#160;&#160;The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the&#10;general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense&#45;Thirring&#10;components of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are&#10;analytically worked out to the first post&#45;Newtonian level. To the Newtonian&#10;order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as&#10;well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation&#10;in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the&#10;primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first&#10;to &#39;Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system&#10;along an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred&#10;close to the Sun&#39;s flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due&#10;to the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of&#10;microarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for&#10;the post&#45;Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)&#10;spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of&#10;the latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current&#10;(formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would&#10;bring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the&#10;predicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not&#10;changed by any of the post&#45;&#45;Keplerian accelerations considered. The&#10;calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any&#10;alternative models of gravity as well.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12063v1) |&#10;| Generalized Robot Learning Framework | Jiahuan Yan, Zhouyang Hong, Yu Zhao, Yu Tian, Yunxin Liu, Travis Davies, Luhui Hu | &#160;&#160;Imitation based robot learning has recently gained significant attention in&#10;the robotics field due to its theoretical potential for transferability and&#10;generalizability. However, it remains notoriously costly, both in terms of&#10;hardware and data collection, and deploying it in real&#45;world environments&#10;demands meticulous setup of robots and precise experimental conditions. In this&#10;paper, we present a low&#45;cost robot learning framework that is both easily&#10;reproducible and transferable to various robots and environments. We&#10;demonstrate that deployable imitation learning can be successfully applied even&#10;to industrial&#45;grade robots, not just expensive collaborative robotic arms.&#10;Furthermore, our results show that multi&#45;task robot learning is achievable with&#10;simple network architectures and fewer demonstrations than previously thought&#10;necessary. As the current evaluating method is almost subjective when it comes&#10;to real&#45;world manipulation tasks, we propose Voting Positive Rate (VPR) &#45; a&#10;novel evaluation strategy that provides a more objective assessment of&#10;performance. We conduct an extensive comparison of success rates across various&#10;self&#45;designed tasks to validate our approach. To foster collaboration and&#10;support the robot learning community, we have open&#45;sourced all relevant&#10;datasets and model checkpoints, available at huggingface.co/ZhiChengAI.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12061v1) |&#10;| PARAPHRASUS : A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Paraphrase&#10; &#160;Detection Models | Andrianos Michail, Simon Clematide, Juri Opitz | &#160;&#160;The task of determining whether two texts are paraphrases has long been a&#10;challenge in NLP. However, the prevailing notion of paraphrase is often quite&#10;simplistic, offering only a limited view of the vast spectrum of paraphrase&#10;phenomena. Indeed, we find that evaluating models in a paraphrase dataset can&#10;leave uncertainty about their true semantic understanding. To alleviate this,&#10;we release paraphrasus, a benchmark designed for multi&#45;dimensional assessment&#10;of paraphrase detection models and finer model selection. We find that&#10;paraphrase detection models under a fine&#45;grained evaluation lens exhibit&#10;trade&#45;offs that cannot be captured through a single classification dataset.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12060v1) |&#10;| Dual&#45;Layer Training and Decoding of Large Language Model with&#10; &#160;Simultaneously Thinking and Speaking | Ningyuan Xi, Xiaoyu Wang, Yetao Wu, Teng Chen, Qingqing Gu, Jinxian Qu, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong Chen, Luo Ji | &#160;&#160;Large Language Model can reasonably understand and generate human expressions&#10;but may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have&#10;been several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but&#10;most of them are not data&#45;driven or training&#45;based. In this paper, we are&#10;motivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel&#10;model architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts&#10;and then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines&#10;to annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt&#45;response samples, then&#10;add language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We&#10;train the language model by the thoughts&#45;augmented data and successfully let&#10;the thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally&#10;output more reasonable responses. Both qualitative examples and quantitative&#10;results validate the effectiveness and performance of TaS.

To address these&#10;concerns, recent research has focused on developing zero&#45;knowledge machine&#10;learning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of&#10;ML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have&#10;substantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily&#10;optimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the&#10;substantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the&#10;model and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new&#10;Commit&#45;and&#45;Prove SNARK (CP&#45;SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that&#10;effectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML&#10;pipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white&#45;box use of the&#10;underlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic&#10;polynomial commitment and only makes black&#45;box use of the proof system. As a&#10;result, Artemis is compatible with state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art proof systems without&#10;trusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP&#45;SNARKs, evaluate&#10;their performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial&#10;improvements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover&#10;costs and maintaining efficiency even for large&#45;scale models. For example, for&#10;the VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from&#10;11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML&#10;towards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and&#10;complex ML models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12055v1) |&#10;| MMP for Enriques pairs and singular Enriques varieties | Francesco Antonio Denisi, Ángel David Ríos Ortiz, Nikolaos Tsakanikas, Zhixin Xie | &#160;&#160;We introduce and study the class of primitive Enriques varieties, whose&#10;smooth members are Enriques manifolds. We provide several examples and we&#10;demonstrate that this class is stable under the operations of the Minimal Model&#10;Program (MMP). In particular, given an Enriques manifold $Y$ and an effective&#10;$mathbb{R}$&#45;divisor $B_Y$ on $Y$ such that the pair $(Y,B_Y)$ is log&#10;canonical, we prove that any $(K_Y+B_Y)$&#45;MMP terminates with a minimal model&#10;$(Y&#39;,B_{Y&#39;})$ of $(Y,B_Y)$, where $Y&#39;$ is a $mathbb{Q}$&#45;factorial primitive&#10;Enriques variety with canonical singularities.

Published codes focus on&#10;continuous rotations and unitary groups, which generally are not applicable to&#10;systems with strong crystal&#45;field effects. The PointGroupNRG code implements&#10;symmetries related to discrete rotation groups, which are defined by the user&#10;in terms of Clebsch&#45;Gordan coefficients, together with particle conservation&#10;and spin rotation symmetries. In this paper we present a new version of the&#10;code that extends the available finite groups, previously limited to simply&#10;reducible point groups, in a way that all point and double groups become&#10;accessible. It also includes the full spin&#45;orbital rotation group. Moreover, to&#10;improve the code&#39;s flexibility for impurities with complex interactions, this&#10;new version allows to choose between a standard Anderson Hamiltonian for the&#10;impurity or, as another novel feature, an ionic model that requires only the&#10;spectrum and the impurity Lehmann amplitudes.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12050v1) |&#10;| Quantum&#45;like nonlinear interferometry with frequency&#45;engineered&#10; &#160;classical light | Romain Dalidet, Anthony Martin, Grégory Sauder, Laurent Labonté, Sébastien Tanzilli | &#160;&#160;Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic&#10;entanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits. Nonlinear&#10;optics has served as a workhorse for the generation of entangled photon pairs,&#10;ensuring both energy and phase conservation, but at the cost of limited rate&#10;and degraded signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio compared to laser&#45;based interferometry&#10;approaches. We present a &quot;quantum&#45;like&quot; nonlinear optical method that reaches&#10;super&#45;resolution in single&#45;photon detection regime. This is achieved by&#10;replacing photon&#45;pairs by coherent states of light, mimicking quantum&#10;properties through classical nonlinear optics processes. Our scheme utilizes&#10;two high&#45;brightness lasers. This results in a substantially greater&#10;signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio compared to its quantum counterpart. Such an approach&#10;paves the way to significantly reduced acquisition times, providing a pathway&#10;to explore signals across a broader range of bandwidth. The need to increase&#10;the frequency bandwidth of the quantum sensor significantly motivates the&#10;potential applications of this pathway.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12049v1) |&#10;| A Survey&#45;Based Quantitative Analysis of Stress Factors and Their Impacts&#10; &#160;Among Cybersecurity Professionals | Sunil Arora, John D. Hastings | &#160;&#160;This study investigates the prevalence and underlying causes of work&#45;related&#10;stress and burnout among cybersecurity professionals using a quantitative&#10;survey approach guided by the Job Demands&#45;Resources model. Analysis of&#10;responses from 50 cybersecurity practitioners reveals an alarming reality: 44%&#10;report experiencing severe work&#45;related stress and burnout, while an additional&#10;28% are uncertain about their condition. The demanding nature of cybersecurity&#10;roles, unrealistic expectations, and unsupportive organizational cultures&#10;emerge as primary factors fueling this crisis. Notably, 66% of respondents&#10;perceive cybersecurity jobs as more stressful than other IT positions, with 84%&#10;facing additional challenges due to the pandemic and recent high&#45;profile&#10;breaches. The study finds that most cybersecurity experts are reluctant to&#10;report their struggles to management, perpetuating a cycle of silence and&#10;neglect. To address this critical issue, the paper recommends that&#10;organizations foster supportive work environments, implement mindfulness&#10;programs, and address systemic challenges. By prioritizing the mental health of&#10;cybersecurity professionals, organizations can cultivate a more resilient and&#10;effective workforce to protect against an ever&#45;evolving threat landscape.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12047v1) |&#10;| Using Large Language Models to Generate Clinical Trial Tables and&#10; &#160;Figures | Yumeng Yang, Peter Krusche, Kristyn Pantoja, Cheng Shi, Ethan Ludmir, Kirk Roberts, Gen Zhu | &#160;&#160;Tables, figures, and listings (TFLs) are essential tools for summarizing&#10;clinical trial data. Creation of TFLs for reporting activities is often a&#10;time&#45;consuming task encountered routinely during the execution of clinical&#10;trials. This study explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate&#10;the generation of TFLs through prompt engineering and few&#45;shot transfer&#10;learning. Using public clinical trial data in ADaM format, our results&#10;demonstrated that LLMs can efficiently generate TFLs with prompt instructions,&#10;showcasing their potential in this domain. Furthermore, we developed a&#10;conservational agent named Clinical Trial TFL Generation Agent: An app that&#10;matches user queries to predefined prompts that produce customized programs to&#10;generate specific predefined TFLs.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12046v2) |&#10;| Handling Long&#45;Term Safety and Uncertainty in Safe Reinforcement Learning | Jonas Günster, Puze Liu, Jan Peters, Davide Tateo | &#160;&#160;Safety is one of the key issues preventing the deployment of reinforcement&#10;learning techniques in real&#45;world robots. While most approaches in the Safe&#10;Reinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and&#10;robot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them&#10;in complex real&#45;world settings. Instead, model&#45;based approaches that&#10;incorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning&#10;framework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on&#10;the real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot&#10;dynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task&#45;specific and hard&#10;to obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to&#10;compute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long&#45;term safety&#10;requirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe&#10;exploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus&#10;on ensuring long&#45;term safety and handling of uncertainty. Our approach is&#10;competitive or superior to state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methods in final performance while&#10;maintaining safer behavior during training.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12045v1) |&#10;| Quasiperiodic Floquet&#45;Gibbs states in Rydberg atomic systems | Wilson S. Martins, Federico Carollo, Kay Brandner, Igor Lesanovsky | &#160;&#160;Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by&#10;fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an&#10;equilibrium&#45;like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet&#45;Magnus&#10;Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi&#39;s golden rule, we show&#10;that such Floquet&#45;Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated&#10;Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab&#45;frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function&#10;of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the&#10;system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which&#10;is necessary to uphold high&#45;lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To&#10;corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five&#10;interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate&#10;numerically that the second&#45;order Floquet&#45;Gibbs state of this system is&#10;essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding&#10;Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently&#10;large.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12044v1) |&#10;| Understanding the Effects of the Baidu&#45;ULTR Logging Policy on Two&#45;Tower&#10; &#160;Models | Morris de Haan, Philipp Hager | &#160;&#160;Despite the popularity of the two&#45;tower model for unbiased learning to rank&#10;(ULTR) tasks, recent work suggests that it suffers from a major limitation that&#10;could lead to its collapse in industry applications: the problem of logging&#10;policy confounding. Several potential solutions have even been proposed;&#10;however, the evaluation of these methods was mostly conducted using&#10;semi&#45;synthetic simulation experiments. This paper bridges the gap between&#10;theory and practice by investigating the confounding problem on the largest&#10;real&#45;world dataset, Baidu&#45;ULTR. Our main contributions are threefold: 1) we&#10;show that the conditions for the confounding problem are given on Baidu&#45;ULTR,&#10;2) the confounding problem bears no significant effect on the two&#45;tower model,&#10;and 3) we point to a potential mismatch between expert annotations, the golden&#10;standard in ULTR, and user click behavior.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12043v1) |&#10;| ASR Benchmarking: Need for a More Representative Conversational Dataset | Gaurav Maheshwari, Dmitry Ivanov, Théo Johannet, Kevin El Haddad | &#160;&#160;Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable&#10;performance on widely used benchmarks such as LibriSpeech and Fleurs. However,&#10;these benchmarks do not adequately reflect the complexities of real&#45;world&#10;conversational environments, where speech is often unstructured and contains&#10;disfluencies such as pauses, interruptions, and diverse accents. In this study,&#10;we introduce a multilingual conversational dataset, derived from TalkBank,&#10;consisting of unstructured phone conversation between adults. Our results show&#10;a significant performance drop across various state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art ASR models when&#10;tested in conversational settings. Furthermore, we observe a correlation&#10;between Word Error Rate and the presence of speech disfluencies, highlighting&#10;the critical need for more realistic, conversational ASR benchmarks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12042v1) |&#10;&#10;">
