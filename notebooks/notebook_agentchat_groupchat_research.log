This will involve using relevant keywords and possibly setting up alerts for new papers.\n\n2. **Data Extraction (Scientist)**\n   - The scientist will extract relevant information from the papers, such as title, authors, abstract, and domain of application (e.g., healthcare, education, finance, etc.).\n\n3. **Data Organization (Engineer)**\n   - The engineer will create a markdown table format to organize the extracted data. The table will include columns for the title, authors, abstract, and domain.\n\n4. **Data Entry (Engineer)**\n   - The engineer will input the extracted data into the markdown table, ensuring that it is well-formatted and easy to read.\n\n5. **Review and Finalization (Scientist & Engineer)**\n   - The scientist will review the markdown table for accuracy and completeness, while the engineer will ensure that the formatting is correct.\n\n6. **Submission (Scientist)**\n   - The scientist will submit the final markdown table to the admin for approval.\n\n### Feedback Request\nPlease provide feedback on this plan, including any specific requirements or changes you would like to see.", "name": "Planner", "role": "user"}, {"content": "### Feedback on the Plan\n\nOverall, the plan is well-structured and outlines a clear process for finding and organizing recent papers on LLM applications. However, there are a few areas where improvements can be made to enhance the effectiveness and verifiability of the output:\n\n1. **Source URL Inclusion:**\n   - It is essential to include verifiable information such as the source URL for each paper in the markdown table. This will allow users to easily access the original papers for further reading and verification. Consider adding a column for the URL in the markdown table.\n\n2. **Keyword Specification:**\n   - The plan mentions using \"relevant keywords\" for searching papers. It would be beneficial to specify which keywords will be used to ensure a focused search. For example, keywords like \"Large Language Models,\" \"GPT,\" \"transformers,\" etc., could be included.\n\n3. **Domain Categorization:**\n   - While the plan mentions categorizing papers by domain, it would be helpful to define the specific domains that will be included in the table. This will provide clarity and ensure consistency in categorization.\n\n4. **Data Extraction Details:**\n   - The plan could benefit from specifying how the scientist will determine the domain of application for each paper. Will this be based on the abstract, keywords, or another method? Providing clarity on this process will enhance the reliability of the categorization.\n\n5. **Review Process:**\n   - The review process is a good step, but it might be useful to include a checklist of criteria for the scientist to use when reviewing the markdown table. This could include checking for completeness, accuracy of information, and proper formatting.\n\n6. **Timeline:**\n   - Consider adding a timeline for each step of the process. This will help in managing expectations and ensuring that the task is completed in a timely manner.\n\n### Revised Plan Suggestion\n\n**Objective:** To find recent papers on Large Language Model (LLM) applications from arXiv in the last week and create a markdown table categorizing them by different domains.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Search for Papers (Scientist)**\n   - Use arXiv's search functionality with specific keywords (e.g., \"Large Language Models,\" \"GPT,\" \"transformers\") to filter papers published in the last week.\n\n2. **Data Extraction (Scientist)**\n   - Extract relevant information: title, authors, abstract, domain of application, and source URL.\n\n3. **Data Organization (Engineer)**\n   - Create a markdown table format with columns for title, authors, abstract, domain, and source URL.\n\n4. **Data Entry (Engineer)**\n   - Input the extracted data into the markdown table, ensuring proper formatting.\n\n5. **Review and Finalization (Scientist & Engineer)**\n   - Review the markdown table for accuracy and completeness, using a checklist for verification.\n\n6. **Submission (Scientist)**\n   - Submit the final markdown table to the admin for approval.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the plan will be more robust, verifiable, and user-friendly.", "name": "Critic", "role": "user"}], "temperature": 0, "model": "gpt-4o-mini"}, "response": "ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-A8Loza25s5zvjP2IPsEzwpdpUdytR', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='### Revised Plan\\n\\n**Objective:** To find recent papers on Large Language Model (LLM) applications from arXiv in the last week and create a markdown table categorizing them by different domains.\\n\\n**Steps:**\\n\\n1. **Search for Papers (Scientist)**\\n   - Use arXiv\\'s search functionality with specific keywords such as \"Large Language Models,\" \"GPT,\" \"transformers,\" and \"LLM applications\" to filter papers published in the last week.\\n\\n2. **Data Extraction (Scientist)**\\n   - Extract relevant information from each paper, including:\\n     - Title\\n     - Authors\\n     - Abstract\\n     - Domain of application (e.g., healthcare, education, finance, etc.)\\n     - Source URL\\n\\n3. **Data Organization (Engineer)**\\n   - Create a markdown table format with the following columns:\\n     - Title\\n     - Authors\\n     - Abstract\\n     - Domain\\n     - Source URL\\n\\n4. **Data Entry (Engineer)**\\n   - Input the extracted data into the markdown table, ensuring proper formatting and clarity.\\n\\n5. **Review and Finalization (Scientist & Engineer)**\\n   - Review the markdown table for accuracy and completeness, using a checklist that includes:\\n     - Completeness of information\\n     - Accuracy of details\\n     - Proper formatting\\n     - Correct categorization of domains\\n\\n6. **Submission (Scientist)**\\n   - Submit the final markdown table to the admin for approval.\\n\\n### Timeline\\n- **Day 1:** Search for papers and extract data.\\n- **Day 2:** Organize data into markdown table format.\\n- **Day 3:** Review and finalize the table.\\n- **Day 4:** Submit the table for approval.\\n\\nBy following this revised plan, the process will be more structured, ensuring that the output is comprehensive, verifiable, and user-friendly.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1726553869, model='gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_483d39d857', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=379, prompt_tokens=1003, total_tokens=1382, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0}), cost=0.00037785, message_retrieval_function=<bound method OpenAIClient.message_retrieval of <autogen.oai.client.OpenAIClient object at 0x7fb69ace9490>>)", "is_cached": 1, "cost": 0.00037785, "start_time": "2024-09-23 03:46:57.324124", "end_time": "2024-09-23 03:46:57.324774", "thread_id": 140424919849856, "source_name": "Scientist"}

This will involve using relevant keywords and possibly setting up alerts for new papers.\n\n2. **Data Extraction (Scientist)**\n   - The scientist will extract relevant information from the papers, such as title, authors, abstract, and domain of application (e.g., healthcare, education, finance, etc.).\n\n3. **Data Organization (Engineer)**\n   - The engineer will create a markdown table format to organize the extracted data. The table will include columns for the title, authors, abstract, and domain.\n\n4. **Data Entry (Engineer)**\n   - The engineer will input the extracted data into the markdown table, ensuring that it is well-formatted and easy to read.\n\n5. **Review and Finalization (Scientist & Engineer)**\n   - The scientist will review the markdown table for accuracy and completeness, while the engineer will ensure that the formatting is correct.\n\n6. **Submission (Scientist)**\n   - The scientist will submit the final markdown table to the admin for approval.\n\n### Feedback Request\nPlease provide feedback on this plan, including any specific requirements or changes you would like to see.", "role": "user", "name": "Planner"}, {"content": "### Feedback on the Plan\n\nOverall, the plan is well-structured and outlines a clear process for finding and organizing recent papers on LLM applications. However, there are a few areas where improvements can be made to enhance the effectiveness and verifiability of the output:\n\n1. **Source URL Inclusion:**\n   - It is essential to include verifiable information such as the source URL for each paper in the markdown table. This will allow users to easily access the original papers for further reading and verification. Consider adding a column for the URL in the markdown table.\n\n2. **Keyword Specification:**\n   - The plan mentions using \"relevant keywords\" for searching papers. It would be beneficial to specify which keywords will be used to ensure a focused search. For example, keywords like \"Large Language Models,\" \"GPT,\" \"transformers,\" etc., could be included.\n\n3. **Domain Categorization:**\n   - While the plan mentions categorizing papers by domain, it would be helpful to define the specific domains that will be included in the table. This will provide clarity and ensure consistency in categorization.\n\n4. **Data Extraction Details:**\n   - The plan could benefit from specifying how the scientist will determine the domain of application for each paper. Will this be based on the abstract, keywords, or another method? Providing clarity on this process will enhance the reliability of the categorization.\n\n5. **Review Process:**\n   - The review process is a good step, but it might be useful to include a checklist of criteria for the scientist to use when reviewing the markdown table. This could include checking for completeness, accuracy of information, and proper formatting.\n\n6. **Timeline:**\n   - Consider adding a timeline for each step of the process. This will help in managing expectations and ensuring that the task is completed in a timely manner.\n\n### Revised Plan Suggestion\n\n**Objective:** To find recent papers on Large Language Model (LLM) applications from arXiv in the last week and create a markdown table categorizing them by different domains.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Search for Papers (Scientist)**\n   - Use arXiv's search functionality with specific keywords (e.g., \"Large Language Models,\" \"GPT,\" \"transformers\") to filter papers published in the last week.\n\n2. **Data Extraction (Scientist)**\n   - Extract relevant information: title, authors, abstract, domain of application, and source URL.\n\n3. **Data Organization (Engineer)**\n   - Create a markdown table format with columns for title, authors, abstract, domain, and source URL.\n\n4. **Data Entry (Engineer)**\n   - Input the extracted data into the markdown table, ensuring proper formatting.\n\n5. **Review and Finalization (Scientist & Engineer)**\n   - Review the markdown table for accuracy and completeness, using a checklist for verification.\n\n6. **Submission (Scientist)**\n   - Submit the final markdown table to the admin for approval.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the plan will be more robust, verifiable, and user-friendly.", "role": "user", "name": "Critic"}, {"content": "### Revised Plan\n\n**Objective:** To find recent papers on Large Language Model (LLM) applications from arXiv in the last week and create a markdown table categorizing them by different domains.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Search for Papers (Scientist)**\n   - Use arXiv's search functionality with specific keywords such as \"Large Language Models,\" \"GPT,\" \"transformers,\" and \"LLM applications\" to filter papers published in the last week.\n\n2. **Data Extraction (Scientist)**\n   - Extract relevant information from each paper, including:\n     - Title\n     - Authors\n     - Abstract\n     - Domain of application (e.g., healthcare, education, finance, etc.)\n     - Source URL\n\n3. **Data Organization (Engineer)**\n   - Create a markdown table format with the following columns:\n     - Title\n     - Authors\n     - Abstract\n     - Domain\n     - Source URL\n\n4. **Data Entry (Engineer)**\n   - Input the extracted data into the markdown table, ensuring proper formatting and clarity.\n\n5. **Review and Finalization (Scientist & Engineer)**\n   - Review the markdown table for accuracy and completeness, using a checklist that includes:\n     - Completeness of information\n     - Accuracy of details\n     - Proper formatting\n     - Correct categorization of domains\n\n6. **Submission (Scientist)**\n   - Submit the final markdown table to the admin for approval.\n\n### Timeline\n- **Day 1:** Search for papers and extract data.\n- **Day 2:** Organize data into markdown table format.\n- **Day 3:** Review and finalize the table.\n- **Day 4:** Submit the table for approval.\n\nBy following this revised plan, the process will be more structured, ensuring that the output is comprehensive, verifiable, and user-friendly.", "role": "user", "name": "Scientist"}, {"content": "Read the above conversation.

This will involve using relevant keywords and possibly setting up alerts for new papers.\n\n2. **Data Extraction (Scientist)**\n   - The scientist will extract relevant information from the papers, such as title, authors, abstract, and domain of application (e.g., healthcare, education, finance, etc.).\n\n3. **Data Organization (Engineer)**\n   - The engineer will create a markdown table format to organize the extracted data. The table will include columns for the title, authors, abstract, and domain.\n\n4. **Data Entry (Engineer)**\n   - The engineer will input the extracted data into the markdown table, ensuring that it is well-formatted and easy to read.\n\n5. **Review and Finalization (Scientist & Engineer)**\n   - The scientist will review the markdown table for accuracy and completeness, while the engineer will ensure that the formatting is correct.\n\n6. **Submission (Scientist)**\n   - The scientist will submit the final markdown table to the admin for approval.\n\n### Feedback Request\nPlease provide feedback on this plan, including any specific requirements or changes you would like to see.", "name": "Planner", "role": "user"}, {"content": "### Feedback on the Plan\n\nOverall, the plan is well-structured and outlines a clear process for finding and organizing recent papers on LLM applications. However, there are a few areas where improvements can be made to enhance the effectiveness and verifiability of the output:\n\n1. **Source URL Inclusion:**\n   - It is essential to include verifiable information such as the source URL for each paper in the markdown table. This will allow users to easily access the original papers for further reading and verification. Consider adding a column for the URL in the markdown table.\n\n2. **Keyword Specification:**\n   - The plan mentions using \"relevant keywords\" for searching papers. It would be beneficial to specify which keywords will be used to ensure a focused search. For example, keywords like \"Large Language Models,\" \"GPT,\" \"transformers,\" etc., could be included.\n\n3. **Domain Categorization:**\n   - While the plan mentions categorizing papers by domain, it would be helpful to define the specific domains that will be included in the table. This will provide clarity and ensure consistency in categorization.\n\n4. **Data Extraction Details:**\n   - The plan could benefit from specifying how the scientist will determine the domain of application for each paper. Will this be based on the abstract, keywords, or another method? Providing clarity on this process will enhance the reliability of the categorization.\n\n5. **Review Process:**\n   - The review process is a good step, but it might be useful to include a checklist of criteria for the scientist to use when reviewing the markdown table. This could include checking for completeness, accuracy of information, and proper formatting.\n\n6. **Timeline:**\n   - Consider adding a timeline for each step of the process. This will help in managing expectations and ensuring that the task is completed in a timely manner.\n\n### Revised Plan Suggestion\n\n**Objective:** To find recent papers on Large Language Model (LLM) applications from arXiv in the last week and create a markdown table categorizing them by different domains.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Search for Papers (Scientist)**\n   - Use arXiv's search functionality with specific keywords (e.g., \"Large Language Models,\" \"GPT,\" \"transformers\") to filter papers published in the last week.\n\n2. **Data Extraction (Scientist)**\n   - Extract relevant information: title, authors, abstract, domain of application, and source URL.\n\n3. **Data Organization (Engineer)**\n   - Create a markdown table format with columns for title, authors, abstract, domain, and source URL.\n\n4. **Data Entry (Engineer)**\n   - Input the extracted data into the markdown table, ensuring proper formatting.\n\n5. **Review and Finalization (Scientist & Engineer)**\n   - Review the markdown table for accuracy and completeness, using a checklist for verification.\n\n6. **Submission (Scientist)**\n   - Submit the final markdown table to the admin for approval.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the plan will be more robust, verifiable, and user-friendly.", "name": "Critic", "role": "user"}, {"content": "### Revised Plan\n\n**Objective:** To find recent papers on Large Language Model (LLM) applications from arXiv in the last week and create a markdown table categorizing them by different domains.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Search for Papers (Scientist)**\n   - Use arXiv's search functionality with specific keywords such as \"Large Language Models,\" \"GPT,\" \"transformers,\" and \"LLM applications\" to filter papers published in the last week.\n\n2. **Data Extraction (Scientist)**\n   - Extract relevant information from each paper, including:\n     - Title\n     - Authors\n     - Abstract\n     - Domain of application (e.g., healthcare, education, finance, etc.)\n     - Source URL\n\n3. **Data Organization (Engineer)**\n   - Create a markdown table format with the following columns:\n     - Title\n     - Authors\n     - Abstract\n     - Domain\n     - Source URL\n\n4. **Data Entry (Engineer)**\n   - Input the extracted data into the markdown table, ensuring proper formatting and clarity.\n\n5. **Review and Finalization (Scientist & Engineer)**\n   - Review the markdown table for accuracy and completeness, using a checklist that includes:\n     - Completeness of information\n     - Accuracy of details\n     - Proper formatting\n     - Correct categorization of domains\n\n6. **Submission (Scientist)**\n   - Submit the final markdown table to the admin for approval.\n\n### Timeline\n- **Day 1:** Search for papers and extract data.\n- **Day 2:** Organize data into markdown table format.\n- **Day 3:** Review and finalize the table.\n- **Day 4:** Submit the table for approval.\n\nBy following this revised plan, the process will be more structured, ensuring that the output is comprehensive, verifiable, and user-friendly.", "name": "Scientist", "role": "user"}], "temperature": 0, "model": "gpt-4o-mini"}, "response": "ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-A8Lp4pWlpp62atAkmKpOsdn8aWgtc', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='### Implementation Plan\\n\\nNow that we have a clear plan, I will proceed to implement the data extraction and organization of recent papers on LLM applications from arXiv.

This will involve using relevant keywords and possibly setting up alerts for new papers.\n\n2. **Data Extraction (Scientist)**\n   - The scientist will extract relevant information from the papers, such as title, authors, abstract, and domain of application (e.g., healthcare, education, finance, etc.).\n\n3. **Data Organization (Engineer)**\n   - The engineer will create a markdown table format to organize the extracted data. The table will include columns for the title, authors, abstract, and domain.\n\n4. **Data Entry (Engineer)**\n   - The engineer will input the extracted data into the markdown table, ensuring that it is well-formatted and easy to read.\n\n5. **Review and Finalization (Scientist & Engineer)**\n   - The scientist will review the markdown table for accuracy and completeness, while the engineer will ensure that the formatting is correct.\n\n6. **Submission (Scientist)**\n   - The scientist will submit the final markdown table to the admin for approval.\n\n### Feedback Request\nPlease provide feedback on this plan, including any specific requirements or changes you would like to see.", "role": "user", "name": "Planner"}, {"content": "### Feedback on the Plan\n\nOverall, the plan is well-structured and outlines a clear process for finding and organizing recent papers on LLM applications. However, there are a few areas where improvements can be made to enhance the effectiveness and verifiability of the output:\n\n1. **Source URL Inclusion:**\n   - It is essential to include verifiable information such as the source URL for each paper in the markdown table. This will allow users to easily access the original papers for further reading and verification. Consider adding a column for the URL in the markdown table.\n\n2. **Keyword Specification:**\n   - The plan mentions using \"relevant keywords\" for searching papers. It would be beneficial to specify which keywords will be used to ensure a focused search. For example, keywords like \"Large Language Models,\" \"GPT,\" \"transformers,\" etc., could be included.\n\n3. **Domain Categorization:**\n   - While the plan mentions categorizing papers by domain, it would be helpful to define the specific domains that will be included in the table. This will provide clarity and ensure consistency in categorization.\n\n4. **Data Extraction Details:**\n   - The plan could benefit from specifying how the scientist will determine the domain of application for each paper. Will this be based on the abstract, keywords, or another method? Providing clarity on this process will enhance the reliability of the categorization.\n\n5. **Review Process:**\n   - The review process is a good step, but it might be useful to include a checklist of criteria for the scientist to use when reviewing the markdown table. This could include checking for completeness, accuracy of information, and proper formatting.\n\n6. **Timeline:**\n   - Consider adding a timeline for each step of the process. This will help in managing expectations and ensuring that the task is completed in a timely manner.\n\n### Revised Plan Suggestion\n\n**Objective:** To find recent papers on Large Language Model (LLM) applications from arXiv in the last week and create a markdown table categorizing them by different domains.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Search for Papers (Scientist)**\n   - Use arXiv's search functionality with specific keywords (e.g., \"Large Language Models,\" \"GPT,\" \"transformers\") to filter papers published in the last week.\n\n2. **Data Extraction (Scientist)**\n   - Extract relevant information: title, authors, abstract, domain of application, and source URL.\n\n3. **Data Organization (Engineer)**\n   - Create a markdown table format with columns for title, authors, abstract, domain, and source URL.\n\n4. **Data Entry (Engineer)**\n   - Input the extracted data into the markdown table, ensuring proper formatting.\n\n5. **Review and Finalization (Scientist & Engineer)**\n   - Review the markdown table for accuracy and completeness, using a checklist for verification.\n\n6. **Submission (Scientist)**\n   - Submit the final markdown table to the admin for approval.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the plan will be more robust, verifiable, and user-friendly.", "role": "user", "name": "Critic"}, {"content": "### Revised Plan\n\n**Objective:** To find recent papers on Large Language Model (LLM) applications from arXiv in the last week and create a markdown table categorizing them by different domains.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Search for Papers (Scientist)**\n   - Use arXiv's search functionality with specific keywords such as \"Large Language Models,\" \"GPT,\" \"transformers,\" and \"LLM applications\" to filter papers published in the last week.\n\n2. **Data Extraction (Scientist)**\n   - Extract relevant information from each paper, including:\n     - Title\n     - Authors\n     - Abstract\n     - Domain of application (e.g., healthcare, education, finance, etc.)\n     - Source URL\n\n3. **Data Organization (Engineer)**\n   - Create a markdown table format with the following columns:\n     - Title\n     - Authors\n     - Abstract\n     - Domain\n     - Source URL\n\n4. **Data Entry (Engineer)**\n   - Input the extracted data into the markdown table, ensuring proper formatting and clarity.\n\n5. **Review and Finalization (Scientist & Engineer)**\n   - Review the markdown table for accuracy and completeness, using a checklist that includes:\n     - Completeness of information\n     - Accuracy of details\n     - Proper formatting\n     - Correct categorization of domains\n\n6. **Submission (Scientist)**\n   - Submit the final markdown table to the admin for approval.\n\n### Timeline\n- **Day 1:** Search for papers and extract data.\n- **Day 2:** Organize data into markdown table format.\n- **Day 3:** Review and finalize the table.\n- **Day 4:** Submit the table for approval.\n\nBy following this revised plan, the process will be more structured, ensuring that the output is comprehensive, verifiable, and user-friendly.", "role": "user", "name": "Scientist"}, {"content": "### Implementation Plan\n\nNow that we have a clear plan, I will proceed to implement the data extraction and organization of recent papers on LLM applications from arXiv.

However, current methods often require hundreds to\\nthousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual\\nobservations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual\\nrepresentations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or\\ntrained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present\\nDynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual\\nrepresentations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a\\nlatent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of\\nimage embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without\\naugmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.\\nImportantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet\\ndatasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real\\nenvironments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly\\nimprove downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised\\nlearning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo\\nhold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,\\nand nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and\\nmeasure its impact on downstream policy performance.

Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,\\nwhich enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions\\ninto different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to\\ngenerate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning\\nwith human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary\\nPosition Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional\\ninformation across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for\\nprocessing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception\\ncapabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL\\ninvestigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By\\nscaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the\\namount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive\\nperformance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to\\nleading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal\\nbenchmarks, outperforming other generalist models.

BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses\\nand 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance\\nof deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to\\nintegrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and\\nperformance. However, widely-used C++-based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,\\ng$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries\\nlike PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of\\ndebugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we\\nintroduce an eager-mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,\\nproviding PyTorch-compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach\\nincludes GPU-accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for\\n2nd-order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear\\nsolvers.

Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby\\npeople can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene-aware social\\ntransformer model (SAST) to forecast long-term (10s) human motion motion.\\nUnlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely\\nvarying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal\\nconvolutional encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer-based bottleneck\\nthat allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model\\nthe conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We\\nbenchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to\\n16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously. Our model\\noutperforms other approaches in terms of realism and diversity on different\\nmetrics and in a user study.

Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon |   Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a\\nperfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from\\nfundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\\\\mu$-distortion) to late-time\\nbaryonic feedback processes (y-distortion). While the y-distortion can be\\ndetected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the\\n$\\\\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\\\\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude\\nsmaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a\\nserious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\\\\mu$\\narises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the\\nprimordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \\\\approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here,\\nwe present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly\\ndetecting $\\\\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but\\nwith an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we\\noptimize the instrument's configuration to target $\\\\mu$ while robustly\\nmarginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike\\nFourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their\\nindividual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing\\nsignificant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the\\n$\\\\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\\\\mu$-distortion at $\\\\approx 5\\\\sigma$ (10$\\\\sigma$)\\nassuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission\\nduration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized\\nconfiguration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular\\nresolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally\\nmeasure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic\\ncorrection at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total\\nthermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12188v1) |\\n| Exoplanet accretion monitoring spectroscopic survey (ENTROPY) I.\\n  Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary-mass\\n  object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C.

This\\nwork presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known\\nyoung, planetary-mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf\\n2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7-21 Mj and age 5-45 Myr, located at 45+-2\\npc. We obtained the first high-resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target\\nwith VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near-UV to visible wavelengths (3200-6800\\nAA). We report resolved H3-H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.\\nBased on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+-1\\nkm/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR\\nexcess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of\\nthe parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+-63 K and radius to 1.5+-0.1\\nRj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet-surface shock model\\nimplies a pre-shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,-40) km/s and a pre-shock\\ndensity of log(n0/cm^-3)=14(+0,-5). Pre-shock velocity points to a mass of\\n6(+8,-4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary\\nLline-Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of\\n1.4(+2.8,-0.9)x10^-8 Mj/yr.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12187v1) |\\n| Qwen2.5-Coder Technical Report | Binyuan Hui, Jian Yang, Zeyu Cui, Jiaxi Yang, Dayiheng Liu, Lei Zhang, Tianyu Liu, Jiajun Zhang, Bowen Yu, Kai Dang, An Yang, Rui Men, Fei Huang, Xingzhang Ren, Xuancheng Ren, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin |   In this report, we introduce the Qwen2.5-Coder series, a significant upgrade\\nfrom its predecessor, CodeQwen1.5.

Xu |   The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our\\nlocal solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions\\nit exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong\\ndynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).\\nConsequently, it is likely that there are large-scale physical structures\\nwithin the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we\\npresent new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\\n(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a\\nmulti-wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the\\nM0.8$-$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring-like morphology. We\\nestimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring to be 79\\\"\\nand 154\\\", respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre\\ndistance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $> 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, a\\nmass of $\\\\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\\\\odot$, and an expansion speed of $\\\\sim$ 20 km\\ns$^{-1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($> 10^{51}$ erg) and\\nmomentum ($> 10^7$ M$_\\\\odot$ km s$^{-1}$). We discuss several possible causes\\nfor the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback\\nand large-scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the\\nM0.8$-$0.2 ring is a single high-energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain\\nthe observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have\\ntaken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which\\nwe now see as the M0.8$-$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an\\nextreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12185v1) |\\n| To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic\\n  reasoning | Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett |   Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting\\nreasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of\\ntasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted\\na quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own\\nevaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives\\nstrong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with\\nmuch smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the\\nanswer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the\\nquestion or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic\\noperations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of\\nCoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing\\nagainst tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic\\nexecution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our\\nresults indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance\\nwhile saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond\\nprompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation\\nacross the whole range of LLM applications.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183v1) |\\n| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs | Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T.

Our study yields several\\ninsights into long-context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of\\nperplexity as a general-purpose performance indicator even in longer-context\\ntasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods\\nsystematically underperform across long-context tasks.

Abkemeier, Edward L.

A novel\\nPoisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.\\n(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering\\na fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of\\npartially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL\\nis the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large\\nimprovement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,\\nbased on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.\\n(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should\\nuse PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence\\nalso reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a\\nshortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that\\nthe comparison of log-likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al.

However,\\ndue to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across\\ndifferent MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In\\nthis study, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework, multiPI-TransBTS,\\nwhich integrates multi-physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.\\nThe model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi-modal\\nimaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor\\ncharacteristics. The multiPI-TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an\\nAdaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi-source, multi-scale feature\\ndecoder. The encoder incorporates a multi-branch architecture to separately\\nextract modality-specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module\\nfuses information from multiple sources using channel-wise and element-wise\\nattention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both\\ncommon and task-specific features through a Task-Specific Feature Introduction\\n(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),\\nTumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on\\nthe BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of\\nmultiPI-TransBTS over the state-of-the-art methods. The model consistently\\nachieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,\\nhighlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results\\nalso indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision\\nand recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a\\nsignificant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving\\nclinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12167v1) |\\n| Synchrotron self-Compton in a radiative-adiabatic fireball scenario:\\n  Modelling the multiwavelength observations in some Fermi/LAT bursts | Nissim Fraija, P.

Most of the wheelchair users\\nneed help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs\\nare not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this\\nproject, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair\\nusers. A robot with a WeHelp system has three modes, following mode, remote\\ncontrol mode and tele-operation mode. In the following mode, the robot follows\\nthe wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can\\nask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the\\nwheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech\\nrecognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode.\\nIn the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy\\nstick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs,\\nsuch as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high\\nshelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant\\ntakes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks\\nfor their needs.

The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation\\nof tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting,\\naddressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable\\nsolutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET\\nchallenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers\\n(FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers.

However, a\\nrobot's ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if\\nnaively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach-avoid\\ndynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a\\nsafety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human's behavior\\nas goal-driven but conditioned on the robot's plan, enabling us to capture\\ninfluence.

This paper\\npresents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large\\nlanguage models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their \\\"black box\\\" and static\\nnature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item\\nvisual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a\\nMultimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style\\nand color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis\\nfor personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the\\nopen-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability\\nto recommend stylish outfits.

While these improve performance, they often reach a\\nsaturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated\\nfeedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key\\nchallenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can\\nover-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and\\naddress errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to\\nidentify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding\\nhow many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too\\nsoon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose\\nMAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty\\nas easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard\\nones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error\\nlocalization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores.\\nMoreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with\\nthree agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on\\nstep-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure\\nsufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating\\nfurther rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5\\nand show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of\\nMAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by\\n4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with\\nbaselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our\\nablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe's RMs and multi-agent\\ncommunication.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147v1) |\\n| Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka |   Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string\\nprocessing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into\\nblocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence\\nof a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another\\noccurrence earlier in $T$.

Maxwell field related\\nto the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,\\nwhereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.\\nWe demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of\\nthe seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations -- either the\\ndilaton or the vector potential equation -- follows from the Einstein equations\\nand the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi\\nidentity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress-energy\\ntensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is\\nprovided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to\\nthree Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis\\nshows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein\\nequations and the equation for the vector potential\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12131v1) |\\n| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components\\n  for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco-Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram |   Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data\\ntogether with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal\\ncomponents used. It is therefore important to determine the number of\\nsignificant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a\\nvariational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for\\nestimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of\\nsamples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This\\neliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of\\nprincipal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.\\nThis framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows\\nand columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),\\nand with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data\\nwith arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as\\ncultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our\\nmethod on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may\\nunderestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the\\nsynthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical\\ndataset. These results suggest that it is broadly applicable across the life\\nsciences.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12129v1) |\\n| Linguini: A benchmark for language-agnostic linguistic reasoning | Eduardo S\\u00e1nchez, Belen Alastruey, Christophe Ropers, Pontus Stenetorp, Mikel Artetxe, Marta R.

The test\\ncovers 894 questions grouped in 160 problems across 75 (mostly) extremely\\nlow-resource languages, extracted from the International Linguistic Olympiad\\ncorpus. To attain high accuracy on this benchmark, models don't need previous\\nknowledge of the tested language, as all the information needed to solve the\\nlinguistic puzzle is presented in the context. We find that, while all analyzed\\nmodels rank below 25% accuracy, there is a significant gap between open and\\nclosed models, with the best-performing proprietary model at 24.05% and the\\nbest-performing open model at 8.84%.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12126v1) |\\n| From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the\\n  primordial black hole reheating scenario | Guillem Dom\\u00e8nech, Jan Tr\\u00e4nkle |   We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs\\noriginate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight\\nPBHs with masses $M\\\\lesssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat\\nit via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate\\nwhether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH\\nreheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the\\ninitial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer\\nfunctions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and\\nisocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation\\nof state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH\\ndominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the\\nspectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive\\nto $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density\\nfluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance\\nas a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\\nobservations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the\\ninitial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we\\nfind that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several\\nfuture GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas,\\nespecially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any\\nearly matter-dominated universe scenario.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12125v1) |\\n| Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules | Anqi Zhang, Wilson S. Geisler |   Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We\\ninvestigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented\\ndisplays having well-separated potential target-object locations. Performance\\nwas compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption\\nthat the information from the different potential target locations is\\nstatistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than\\noptimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the\\nimplausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show\\nthat three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical\\nresults. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near\\noptimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the\\ncentral potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise\\ncauses search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These\\nfindings have far-reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks\\nand other identification tasks in humans and other animals.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12124v1) |\\n| Far-from-equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann\\n  approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows\\n  $v_n$ | Vincenzo Nugara, Vincenzo Greco, Salvatore Plumari |   We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal\\nsystem in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution\\nfunction and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system\\nsizes $R$ and interaction strength $\\\\eta/s$ and identify universality classes\\nbased upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each\\nof this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $\\\\hat\\n\\\\gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results\\nhighlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum\\nmoments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to\\na 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of\\ndifferent sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a\\nsimilar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse\\nflow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system\\nsize and $\\\\eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and\\ntheir response functions, along with the impact of the $\\\\eta/s$ and the system\\ntransverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in\\nmomentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow\\n$v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of\\nlarge opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems\\nevolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play\\nin this process.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12123v1) |\\n| Qwen2.5-Math Technical Report: Toward Mathematical Expert Model via\\n  Self-Improvement | An Yang, Beichen Zhang, Binyuan Hui, Bofei Gao, Bowen Yu, Chengpeng Li, Dayiheng Liu, Jianhong Tu, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin, Keming Lu, Mingfeng Xue, Runji Lin, Tianyu Liu, Xingzhang Ren, Zhenru Zhang |   In this report, we present a series of math-specific large language models:\\nQwen2.5-Math and Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct-1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the\\nQwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self-improvement\\nthroughout the entire pipeline, from pre-training and post-training to\\ninference: (1) During the pre-training phase, Qwen2-Math-Instruct is utilized\\nto generate large-scale, high-quality mathematical data. (2) In the\\npost-training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive\\nsampling from Qwen2-Math-Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative\\nevolution of data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model,\\nit's possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the\\nnext round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the\\nultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct.\\n(3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling,\\noptimizing the model's performance.\\n  Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced\\nmathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and\\nTool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics\\ndatasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and\\nAIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math\\ncompetition problems.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12122v1) |\\n| Computing the $\\\\mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two-Dimensional\\n  Strongly-Correlated Systems | Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn |   We show that the two-dimensional $\\\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time-reversal\\ninvariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary-condition\\ndependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non-interacting and\\nstrongly-correlated insulators.

Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a\\nmoment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching\\nalgorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The\\nmeasurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight\\nto obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim\\nsimulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find\\nthe mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We\\nalso find the E-Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic\\nstructures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical\\nand X-Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to\\nmap large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of\\nthe cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the\\npeaks are similar to X-Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster\\nand show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12119v1) |\\n| Low Frame-rate Speech Codec: a Codec Designed for Fast High-quality\\n  Speech LLM Training and Inference | Edresson Casanova, Ryan Langman, Paarth Neekhara, Shehzeen Hussain, Jason Li, Subhankar Ghosh, Ante Juki\\u0107, Sang-gil Lee |   Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing\\nthrough audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the\\napplication of language modeling techniques to audio data.

Johnson |   Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide\\nstringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post-BBN (Big\\nBang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models\\nwith COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.\\nHere, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark\\nphoton conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous\\nworks only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the\\nchange to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon\\ndistortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the\\ndistortion has an opposite sign and a $\\\\simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We\\nfurthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover\\nthe redshift range $\\\\simeq 2\\\\times 10^6-4\\\\times 10^7$ between the $\\\\mu$-era and\\nthe end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints\\nfor dark photon masses in the range $10^{-4}\\\\,{\\\\rm eV}\\\\lesssim m_{\\\\rm\\ndp}\\\\lesssim 10^{-3}\\\\,{\\\\rm eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We\\ndemonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon\\nto dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $\\\\mu$-type distortion\\nindependent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study\\ndark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with\\nCMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12115v1) |\\n| Bi-objective trail-planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous\\n  environment | Cory M. Simon, Jeffrey Richley, Lucas Overbey, Darleen Perez-Lavin |   Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in\\nresource delivery, patrolling, information-gathering, agriculture, forest fire\\nfighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and\\nsearch-and-rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments -- with e.g.\\nrough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or\\ncapturing robots -- should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of\\nrisks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should\\ntake the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the\\nteam-level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward\\nfrom visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider\\nbi-objective trail-planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a\\nhazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed\\ngraph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of\\nsurvival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a\\nrobot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for\\nthe Pareto-optimal robot-team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team\\nobjectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive\\nthe mission. A human decision-maker can then select trail plans that balance,\\naccording to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony\\noptimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto-optimal set of\\nrobot team trail plans.

Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a\\npowerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,\\ncomplex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in\\nperformance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and\\nits innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer\\nknowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact\\nand efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application\\nacross various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and\\nhistorical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are\\nhighlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational\\nefficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical\\ndeployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of\\nKD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the\\nbreadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case\\nstudies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,\\nsuch as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review\\ndiscusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical\\nconstraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive\\noverview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS.

Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing\\nevidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,\\nthese growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,\\nmore and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth-dependent systems\\nand develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of\\n'growth dependence' still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,\\nwhich impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article\\nproposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the\\nconcept of 'growth dependence' across socio-economic systems. We provide a\\ngeneral definition consisting of four components that can be specified for\\ndifferent empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of\\nmeasurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions\\nor properties of the system under investigation. According to our general\\ndefinition, a socio-economic system is growth-dependent if it requires a\\nlong-term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to\\nmaintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen\\nnormative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to\\nthree areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:\\nemployment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies\\ndemonstrate that whether or not a system is growth-dependent hinges not only on\\nthe empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of\\nthe concept of growth dependence.

However, datasets distributed across each\\nclient in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can\\nbe globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly\\naffects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated\\nlearning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it\\nfails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data.\\nThis results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting\\nthe equally important tail classes.

Recently, this\\ncuriosity has motivated the fMRI-to-image reconstruction task; given the fMRI\\ndata from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual\\nstimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent\\nDiffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex\\nvisual stimuli such as high-resolution natural images from vision datasets.\\nDespite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often\\nlack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.\\nConsequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere\\nvisuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs\\neffectively incorporate multi-modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,\\nand image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image\\ngenerations. Specifically, inspired by the two-streams hypothesis suggesting\\nthat perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain\\nregions, our framework, Brain-Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain\\nregions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from\\nsemantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information\\nregions, Brain-Streams provides accurate multi-modal guidance to LDMs. We\\nvalidate the reconstruction ability of Brain-Streams both quantitatively and\\nqualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI\\ndata.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12099v1) |\\n| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal\\n  execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huy\\u00ean Pham |   Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and\\nconstraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity\\nmarkets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general\\npropagator model under linear functional inequality constraints.

The task of\\nnext-best-view (NBV) planning is to infer the pose of the next viewpoint based\\non the current data, and gradually realize the complete three-dimensional\\nreconstruction. Many existing algorithms, however, suffer a large computational\\nburden due to the use of ray-casting. To address this, this paper proposes a\\nprojection-based NBV planning framework. It can select the next best view at an\\nextremely fast speed while ensuring the complete scanning of the object.\\nSpecifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into\\nellipsoids based on the voxel structure.Then, the next best view is selected\\nfrom the candidate views using a projection-based viewpoint quality evaluation\\nfunction in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy. This process\\nreplaces the ray-casting in voxel structures, significantly improving the\\ncomputational efficiency. Comparative experiments with other algorithms in a\\nsimulation environment show that the framework proposed in this paper can\\nachieve 10 times efficiency improvement on the basis of capturing roughly the\\nsame coverage.

Recent observations of decayless transverse oscillations have shown\\ntwo branches in the relationship between periods and loop lengths. One is a\\nlinear relationship, interpreted as a standing mode. The other shows almost no\\ncorrelation and has not yet been interpreted conclusively. Aims. We\\ninvestigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless\\noscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely\\nfollow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations\\nare standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations\\nwhere the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase\\nare randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal\\nby considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of\\ntelescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast\\nFourier transform.

Mixed-integer Model Predictive Control\\n(MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex\\nscheduling problems in agricultural irrigation.

Using\\nthe structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich\\nwords is $1 + 1/(3 - \\\\mu) \\\\approx 2.25876324$, where $\\\\mu$ is the unique real\\nroot of the polynomial $x^3 - 2x^2 - 1$.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12068v1) |\\n| Fitting Multilevel Factor Models | Tetiana Parshakova, Trevor Hastie, Stephen Boyd |   We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance\\ngiven by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~\\\\cite{parshakova2023factor}.

This is achieved\\nthrough a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive\\ndefinite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of an invertible PSD MLR matrix\\nis also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the\\nrecursive Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of\\nthe inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky\\nfactorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities,\\nyielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement.

Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by\\ntidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to\\ntheir proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the\\nTRAPPIST-1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In\\nthis work, we present the recent implementation of the co-planar tidal torque\\nand forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N-body code\\nPosidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using\\na tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of\\neach planet by taking into account their multi-layer internal structure\\ncomputed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets\\nare not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state.\\nPlanet-planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and\\ntides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a\\nresult, the sub-stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and\\nlong-timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with\\nperiods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12065v1) |\\n| Quantum Magic and Multi-Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei | Florian Br\\u00f6kemeier, S. Momme Hengstenberg, James W. T. Keeble, Caroline E. P. Robin, Federico Rocco, Martin J. Savage |   Motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the\\nquantum complexity of $p$-shell and $sd$-shell nuclei. Valence-space nuclear\\nshell-model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit\\nregisters using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$-shell and 24\\nqubits for the $sd$-shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement\\n($n$-tangles) and magic (non-stabilizerness) are determined. While exact\\nevaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of\\nactive nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex\\nnuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique\\nis introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed\\nnuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\\\\sim 8$ for some\\nnuclei. Significant multi-nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$-shell,\\ndominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of\\nmagic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on\\nthe path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion.\\nThese results indicate that quantum-computing resources will accelerate\\nprecision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12064v1) |\\n| Post-Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a\\n  massive, rotating object | Lorenzo Iorio |   The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the\\ngeneral relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring\\ncomponents of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are\\nanalytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level. To the Newtonian\\norder, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as\\nwell. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation\\nin space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the\\nprimary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first\\nto 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system\\nalong an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred\\nclose to the Sun's flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due\\nto the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of\\nmicroarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for\\nthe post-Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)\\nspacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of\\nthe latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current\\n(formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would\\nbring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the\\npredicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not\\nchanged by any of the post--Keplerian accelerations considered.

To address these\\nconcerns, recent research has focused on developing zero-knowledge machine\\nlearning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of\\nML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have\\nsubstantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily\\noptimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the\\nsubstantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the\\nmodel and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new\\nCommit-and-Prove SNARK (CP-SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that\\neffectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML\\npipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white-box use of the\\nunderlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic\\npolynomial commitment and only makes black-box use of the proof system. As a\\nresult, Artemis is compatible with state-of-the-art proof systems without\\ntrusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP-SNARKs, evaluate\\ntheir performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial\\nimprovements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover\\ncosts and maintaining efficiency even for large-scale models. For example, for\\nthe VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from\\n11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML\\ntowards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and\\ncomplex ML models.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12055v1) |\\n| MMP for Enriques pairs and singular Enriques varieties | Francesco Antonio Denisi, \\u00c1ngel David R\\u00edos Ortiz, Nikolaos Tsakanikas, Zhixin Xie |   We introduce and study the class of primitive Enriques varieties, whose\\nsmooth members are Enriques manifolds.

The PointGroupNRG code implements\\nsymmetries related to discrete rotation groups, which are defined by the user\\nin terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, together with particle conservation\\nand spin rotation symmetries. In this paper we present a new version of the\\ncode that extends the available finite groups, previously limited to simply\\nreducible point groups, in a way that all point and double groups become\\naccessible. It also includes the full spin-orbital rotation group. Moreover, to\\nimprove the code's flexibility for impurities with complex interactions, this\\nnew version allows to choose between a standard Anderson Hamiltonian for the\\nimpurity or, as another novel feature, an ionic model that requires only the\\nspectrum and the impurity Lehmann amplitudes.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12050v1) |\\n| Quantum-like nonlinear interferometry with frequency-engineered\\n  classical light | Romain Dalidet, Anthony Martin, Gr\\u00e9gory Sauder, Laurent Labont\\u00e9, S\\u00e9bastien Tanzilli |   Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic\\nentanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits.

While most approaches in the Safe\\nReinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and\\nrobot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them\\nin complex real-world settings. Instead, model-based approaches that\\nincorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning\\nframework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on\\nthe real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot\\ndynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task-specific and hard\\nto obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to\\ncompute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long-term safety\\nrequirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe\\nexploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus\\non ensuring long-term safety and handling of uncertainty.

However, current methods often require hundreds to\\nthousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual\\nobservations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual\\nrepresentations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or\\ntrained directly through a behavior cloning objective.

Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a\\nlatent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of\\nimage embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without\\naugmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.\\nImportantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet\\ndatasets or cross-embodied datasets.

The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but\\nwith an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we\\noptimize the instrument's configuration to target $\\\\mu$ while robustly\\nmarginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike\\nFourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their\\nindividual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing\\nsignificant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the\\n$\\\\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\\\\mu$-distortion at $\\\\approx 5\\\\sigma$ (10$\\\\sigma$)\\nassuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission\\nduration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized\\nconfiguration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular\\nresolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally\\nmeasure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic\\ncorrection at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total\\nthermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12188v1) |\\n| Exoplanet accretion monitoring spectroscopic survey (ENTROPY) I.\\n  Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary-mass\\n  object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C.

Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic\\n  reasoning | Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett |   Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting\\nreasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of\\ntasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted\\na quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own\\nevaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives\\nstrong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with\\nmuch smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the\\nanswer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the\\nquestion or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic\\noperations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of\\nCoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing\\nagainst tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic\\nexecution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our\\nresults indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance\\nwhile saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond\\nprompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation\\nacross the whole range of LLM applications.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183v1) |\\n| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs | Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T.

Abkemeier, Edward L. Ionides |   Filtering algorithms are fundamental for inference on partially observed\\nstochastic dynamic systems, since they provide access to the likelihood\\nfunction and hence enable likelihood-based or Bayesian inference. A novel\\nPoisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.\\n(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering\\na fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of\\npartially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL\\nis the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large\\nimprovement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,\\nbased on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.\\n(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should\\nuse PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence\\nalso reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a\\nshortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that\\nthe comparison of log-likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al.

If PAL and the particle filter are applied\\nto the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears.

In\\nthis study, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework, multiPI-TransBTS,\\nwhich integrates multi-physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.\\nThe model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi-modal\\nimaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor\\ncharacteristics. The multiPI-TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an\\nAdaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi-source, multi-scale feature\\ndecoder. The encoder incorporates a multi-branch architecture to separately\\nextract modality-specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module\\nfuses information from multiple sources using channel-wise and element-wise\\nattention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both\\ncommon and task-specific features through a Task-Specific Feature Introduction\\n(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),\\nTumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on\\nthe BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of\\nmultiPI-TransBTS over the state-of-the-art methods.

Our results\\nalso indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision\\nand recall in the ET segmentation task.

In the standard GRB afterglow\\nmodel, the relativistic homogeneous shock is usually considered to be fully\\nadiabatic, however, it could be partially radiative.

The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the\\nopen-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability\\nto recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative\\nexamples is employed to enhance the LLM's decision-making process. This creates\\na self-enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in\\nline with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore\\ndataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill-in-the-blank,\\nand complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework's\\nability to generate stylish, trend-aligned outfit suggestions, continuously\\nimproving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our\\nproposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more\\ncohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the\\nproposed framework's potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate\\nsuggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit\\ngeneration.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12150v1) |\\n| Mechanical Wannier-Stark Ladder of Diamond Spin-Mechanical Lamb Wave\\n  Resonators | Philip Andrango, Hailin Wang |   We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier-Stark ladders of\\ndiamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with\\nultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin\\nproperties. Three nearest-neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric\\nconfigurations and a large range of coupling rates have been explored for the\\nrealization of Wannier-Stark ladders of LWRs, potentially enabling long-range\\nconnectivity between spin qubits through their interactions with mechanical\\nvibrations. Additional analysis on the effects of disorder indicates that the\\nproposed Wannier-Stark ladder can be robust against realistic experimental\\nimperfections.

While these improve performance, they often reach a\\nsaturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated\\nfeedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key\\nchallenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can\\nover-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and\\naddress errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to\\nidentify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding\\nhow many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too\\nsoon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose\\nMAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty\\nas easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard\\nones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error\\nlocalization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores.\\nMoreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with\\nthree agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on\\nstep-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure\\nsufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating\\nfurther rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5\\nand show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of\\nMAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by\\n4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with\\nbaselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our\\nablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe's RMs and multi-agent\\ncommunication.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147v1) |\\n| Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka |   Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string\\nprocessing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into\\nblocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence\\nof a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another\\noccurrence earlier in $T$. Due to numerous applications, LZ77 factorization is\\none of the most studied problems on strings. In the 47 years since its\\ninception, several algorithms were developed for different models of\\ncomputation, including parallel, GPU, external-memory, and quantum. Remarkably,\\nhowever, the complexity of the most basic variant is still not settled: All\\nexisting algorithms in the RAM model run in $\\\\Omega(n)$ time, which is a\\n$\\\\Theta(\\\\log n)$ factor away from the lower bound of $\\\\Omega(n/\\\\log n)$\\n(following from the necessity to read the input, which takes $\\\\Theta(n/\\\\log n)$\\nspace for $T\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}^{n}$).\\n  We present the first $o(n)$-time algorithm for LZ77 factorization, breaking\\nthe linear-time barrier present for nearly 50 years. For $T\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}^{n}$, our\\nalgorithm runs in $\\\\mathcal{O}(n/\\\\sqrt{\\\\log n})=o(n)$ time and uses the optimal\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(n/\\\\log n)$ working space. Our algorithm generalizes to\\n$\\\\Sigma=[0..\\\\sigma)$, where $\\\\sigma=n^{\\\\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The runtime and\\nworking space then become $\\\\mathcal{O}((n\\\\log\\\\sigma)/\\\\sqrt{\\\\log n})$ and\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(n/\\\\log_{\\\\sigma} n)$. To obtain our algorithm, we prove a more\\ngeneral result: For any constant $\\\\epsilon\\\\in(0,1)$ and $T\\\\in[0..\\\\sigma)^{n}$,\\nin $\\\\mathcal{O}((n\\\\log\\\\sigma)/\\\\sqrt{\\\\log n})$ time and using\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(n/\\\\log_{\\\\sigma}n)$ space, we can construct an\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(n/\\\\log_{\\\\sigma}n)$-size index that, given any $P=T[j..j+\\\\ell)$\\n(represented as $(j,\\\\ell)$), computes the leftmost occurrence of $P$ in $T$ in\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log^{\\\\epsilon}n)$ time.

For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and\\ntimbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while\\nadvocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its\\nnaturalness and expressiveness.

However, each approach has its own limitations,\\nmaking it less effective to rely solely on either one. An emerging and\\npromising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractive\\nsummarization methods.

Aref'eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov |   In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the\\nfive-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell models has played a crucial role.\\nTypically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while\\nadditional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A\\nmore general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field\\nrepresents spatial longitudinal-transverse anisotropy, while the third and\\nfourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We\\nconsider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero\\ntemperature and five functions at non-zero temperature. Maxwell field related\\nto the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,\\nwhereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.\\nWe demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of\\nthe seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations -- either the\\ndilaton or the vector potential equation -- follows from the Einstein equations\\nand the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi\\nidentity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress-energy\\ntensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is\\nprovided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to\\nthree Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis\\nshows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein\\nequations and the equation for the vector potential\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12131v1) |\\n| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components\\n  for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco-Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram |   Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data\\ntogether with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal\\ncomponents used. It is therefore important to determine the number of\\nsignificant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a\\nvariational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for\\nestimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of\\nsamples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This\\neliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of\\nprincipal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.\\nThis framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows\\nand columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),\\nand with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data\\nwith arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as\\ncultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our\\nmethod on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may\\nunderestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the\\nsynthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical\\ndataset.

In this scenario, ultralight\\nPBHs with masses $M\\\\lesssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat\\nit via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate\\nwhether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH\\nreheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the\\ninitial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer\\nfunctions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and\\nisocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation\\nof state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH\\ndominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the\\nspectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive\\nto $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density\\nfluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance\\nas a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\\nobservations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the\\ninitial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced.

Our results\\nhighlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum\\nmoments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to\\na 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of\\ndifferent sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a\\nsimilar manner.

We\\nfurthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover\\nthe redshift range $\\\\simeq 2\\\\times 10^6-4\\\\times 10^7$ between the $\\\\mu$-era and\\nthe end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints\\nfor dark photon masses in the range $10^{-4}\\\\,{\\\\rm eV}\\\\lesssim m_{\\\\rm\\ndp}\\\\lesssim 10^{-3}\\\\,{\\\\rm eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We\\ndemonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon\\nto dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $\\\\mu$-type distortion\\nindependent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study\\ndark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with\\nCMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12115v1) |\\n| Bi-objective trail-planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous\\n  environment | Cory M. Simon, Jeffrey Richley, Lucas Overbey, Darleen Perez-Lavin |   Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in\\nresource delivery, patrolling, information-gathering, agriculture, forest fire\\nfighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and\\nsearch-and-rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments -- with e.g.\\nrough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or\\ncapturing robots -- should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of\\nrisks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should\\ntake the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the\\nteam-level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward\\nfrom visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider\\nbi-objective trail-planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a\\nhazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed\\ngraph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of\\nsurvival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a\\nrobot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for\\nthe Pareto-optimal robot-team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team\\nobjectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive\\nthe mission. A human decision-maker can then select trail plans that balance,\\naccording to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony\\noptimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto-optimal set of\\nrobot team trail plans. As a case study, we illustrate with an\\ninformation-gathering mission in an art museum.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12114v1) |\\n| Pareto Data Framework: Steps Towards Resource-Efficient Decision Making\\n  Using Minimum Viable Data (MVD) | Tashfain Ahmed, Josh Siegel |   This paper introduces the Pareto Data Framework, an approach for identifying\\nand selecting the Minimum Viable Data (MVD) required for enabling machine\\nlearning applications on constrained platforms such as embedded systems, mobile\\ndevices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We demonstrate that strategic\\ndata reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing\\nbandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies\\nMinimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource-constrained\\nenvironments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient\\npractices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and\\noverprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for\\noptimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data\\nrepresentation. An experimental methodology demonstrates effective acoustic\\ndata characterization after downsampling, quantization, and truncation to\\nsimulate reduced-fidelity sensors and network and storage constraints; results\\nshows that performance can be maintained up to 95\\\\% with sample rates reduced\\nby 75\\\\% and bit depths and clip length reduced by 50\\\\% which translates into\\nsubstantial cost and resource reduction. These findings have implications on\\nthe design and development of constrained systems. The paper also discusses\\nbroader implications of the framework, including the potential to democratize\\nadvanced AI technologies across IoT applications and sectors such as\\nagriculture, transportation, and manufacturing to improve access and multiply\\nthe benefits of data-driven insights.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12112v1) |\\n| Applications of Knowledge Distillation in Remote Sensing: A Survey | Yassine Himeur, Nour Aburaed, Omar Elharrouss, Iraklis Varlamis, Shadi Atalla, Wathiq Mansoor, Hussain Al Ahmad |   With the ever-growing complexity of models in the field of remote sensing\\n(RS), there is an increasing demand for solutions that balance model accuracy\\nwith computational efficiency. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a\\npowerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,\\ncomplex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in\\nperformance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and\\nits innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer\\nknowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact\\nand efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application\\nacross various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and\\nhistorical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are\\nhighlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational\\nefficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical\\ndeployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of\\nKD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the\\nbreadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case\\nstudies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,\\nsuch as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review\\ndiscusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical\\nconstraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive\\noverview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS. Through this\\norganization, the paper not only elucidates the current state of research in KD\\nbut also sets the stage for future research opportunities, thereby contributing\\nsignificantly to both academic research and real-world applications.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12111v1) |\\n| It depends: Varieties of defining growth dependence | Anja Janischewski, Katharina Bohnenberger, Matthias Kranke, Tobias Vogel, Riwan Driouich, Tobias Froese, Stefanie Gerold, Raphael Kaufmann, Lorenz Key\\u00dfer, Jannis Niethammer, Christopher Olk, Matthias Schmelzer, Asl\\u0131 Y\\u00fcr\\u00fck, Steffen Lange |   Many socio-economic systems require positive economic growth rates to\\nfunction properly. Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing\\nevidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,\\nthese growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,\\nmore and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth-dependent systems\\nand develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of\\n'growth dependence' still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,\\nwhich impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article\\nproposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the\\nconcept of 'growth dependence' across socio-economic systems. We provide a\\ngeneral definition consisting of four components that can be specified for\\ndifferent empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of\\nmeasurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions\\nor properties of the system under investigation. According to our general\\ndefinition, a socio-economic system is growth-dependent if it requires a\\nlong-term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to\\nmaintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen\\nnormative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to\\nthree areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:\\nemployment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies\\ndemonstrate that whether or not a system is growth-dependent hinges not only on\\nthe empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of\\nthe concept of growth dependence.

Computer-assisted Surgery systems\\nhave played a crucial role in improving the precision and safety of ESD\\nprocedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognition\\nof surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesion\\ncharacteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real-time\\nsurgical phase recognition algorithms. Existing surgical phase recognition\\nalgorithms struggle to efficiently capture temporal contexts in video-based\\nscenarios, leading to insufficient performance. To address these issues, we\\npropose SPRMamba, a novel Mamba-based framework for ESD surgical phase\\nrecognition. SPRMamba leverages the strengths of Mamba for long-term temporal\\nmodeling while introducing the Scaled Residual TranMamba block to enhance the\\ncapture of fine-grained details, overcoming the limitations of traditional\\ntemporal models like Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformers.\\nMoreover, a Temporal Sample Strategy is introduced to accelerate the\\nprocessing, which is essential for real-time phase recognition in clinical\\nsettings.

However, datasets distributed across each\\nclient in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can\\nbe globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly\\naffects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated\\nlearning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it\\nfails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data.\\nThis results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting\\nthe equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a\\nmethodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,\\nwe propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the\\nlocal training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred\\noptimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state-of-the-art\\nmethods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed\\ndistribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10-LT and\\nCIFAR-100-LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of\\nmodel performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long-tailed\\ndistribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12105v1) |\\n| Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error\\n  Detection | Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia |   Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications.

Recently, this\\ncuriosity has motivated the fMRI-to-image reconstruction task; given the fMRI\\ndata from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual\\nstimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent\\nDiffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex\\nvisual stimuli such as high-resolution natural images from vision datasets.\\nDespite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often\\nlack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.\\nConsequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere\\nvisuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs\\neffectively incorporate multi-modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,\\nand image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image\\ngenerations. Specifically, inspired by the two-streams hypothesis suggesting\\nthat perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain\\nregions, our framework, Brain-Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain\\nregions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from\\nsemantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information\\nregions, Brain-Streams provides accurate multi-modal guidance to LDMs. We\\nvalidate the reconstruction ability of Brain-Streams both quantitatively and\\nqualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI\\ndata.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12099v1) |\\n| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal\\n  execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huy\\u00ean Pham |   Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and\\nconstraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity\\nmarkets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general\\npropagator model under linear functional inequality constraints.

Agyeman, Jinfeng Liu, Sirish L. Shah |   Efficient water management in agriculture is important for mitigating the\\ngrowing freshwater scarcity crisis. Mixed-integer Model Predictive Control\\n(MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex\\nscheduling problems in agricultural irrigation. However, the computational\\ncomplexity of mixed-integer MPC still poses a significant challenge,\\nparticularly in large-scale applications. This study proposes an approach to\\nenhance the computational efficiency of mixed-integer MPC-based irrigation\\nschedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture\\ndynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed-integer linear\\nrepresentation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the\\nmixed-integer MPC-based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a\\nmixed-integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed-integer\\nnonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global\\noptimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated\\nthrough comparative studies conducted on a large-scale agricultural field\\nacross two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models,\\nspecifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used\\ntriggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU-based approach significantly\\nreduces solution times -- by up to 99.5\\\\% -- while achieving comparable\\nperformance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water\\nUse Efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, the ReLU-based approach maintains enhanced\\nperformance in terms of total prescribed irrigation and IWUE compared to the\\nwidely-used triggered irrigation scheduling method.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12082v1) |\\n| Design of Ligand-Binding Proteins with Atomic Flow Matching | Junqi Liu, Shaoning Li, Chence Shi, Zhi Yang, Jian Tang |   Designing novel proteins that bind to small molecules is a long-standing\\nchallenge in computational biology, with applications in developing catalysts,\\nbiosensors, and more. Current computational methods rely on the assumption that\\nthe binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible,\\nas conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon\\nbinding. In this work, we formulate proteins and molecules as unified\\nbiotokens, and present AtomFlow, a novel deep generative model under the\\nflow-matching framework for the design of ligand-binding proteins from the 2D\\ntarget molecular graph alone. Operating on representative atoms of biotokens,\\nAtomFlow captures the flexibility of ligands and generates ligand conformations\\nand protein backbone structures iteratively.

Wehrheim, Lucas Zinz, Johanna Rahm, Ashwin Balakrishnan, Alexandra Kaminer, Mike Heilemann, Matthias Kaschube |   Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at\\nthe nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological\\norganization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of\\nfluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses\\nremain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced\\nlaser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and\\nincreased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses.

We propose AdaPrune, a method for UDA\\nwhereby training examples are removed to attempt to align the training\\ndistribution to that of the target data. By adopting the maximum mean\\ndiscrepancy (MMD) as the criterion for alignment, the problem can be neatly\\nformulated and solved as an integer quadratic program. We evaluate our approach\\non a real-world domain shift task of bioacoustic event detection. As a method\\nfor UDA, we show that AdaPrune outperforms related techniques, and is\\ncomplementary to other UDA algorithms such as CORAL. Our analysis of the\\nrelationship between the MMD and model accuracy, along with t-SNE plots,\\nvalidate the proposed method as a principled and well-founded way of performing\\ndata pruning.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12076v1) |\\n| The elastica sling | Alessandro Cazzolli, Francesco Dal Corso |   The nonlinear mechanics of a flexible elastic rod constrained at its edges by\\na pair of sliding sleeves is analyzed.

R. Elder, Zhi-Feng Huang, T. Ala-Nissila |   In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene\\nstacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a\\nrecently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems\\nincorporating out-of-plane deformations and parameterized to match to density\\nfunctional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems.

Quantitative predictions are\\nmade for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a\\ndefect-free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and\\nsystem size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by\\nroughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence\\nacross the multilayer.

Existing defense mechanisms\\ntypically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and\\ninvolve retraining an auxiliary model or fine-tuning the entire victim model.\\nHowever, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always\\nfeasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and\\nlightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD-FT, that does not require an\\nadditional clean dataset and fine-tunes only a very small part of the model to\\ndisinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a\\nsimple data purification process to identify and select the most-likely clean\\ndata from the poisoned training dataset. The self-purified clean dataset is\\nthen used for activation clipping and fine-tuning only the last classification\\nlayer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation\\nclipping, and classifier fine-tuning, our mechanism PAD-FT demonstrates\\nsuperior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as\\nconfirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12072v1) |\\n| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing\\n  data in Irish sagas | P.

Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by\\ntidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to\\ntheir proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the\\nTRAPPIST-1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In\\nthis work, we present the recent implementation of the co-planar tidal torque\\nand forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N-body code\\nPosidonius.

Savage |   Motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the\\nquantum complexity of $p$-shell and $sd$-shell nuclei. Valence-space nuclear\\nshell-model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit\\nregisters using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$-shell and 24\\nqubits for the $sd$-shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement\\n($n$-tangles) and magic (non-stabilizerness) are determined. While exact\\nevaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of\\nactive nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex\\nnuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique\\nis introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed\\nnuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\\\\sim 8$ for some\\nnuclei. Significant multi-nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$-shell,\\ndominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of\\nmagic.

To address these\\nconcerns, recent research has focused on developing zero-knowledge machine\\nlearning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of\\nML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have\\nsubstantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily\\noptimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the\\nsubstantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the\\nmodel and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new\\nCommit-and-Prove SNARK (CP-SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that\\neffectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML\\npipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white-box use of the\\nunderlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic\\npolynomial commitment and only makes black-box use of the proof system. As a\\nresult, Artemis is compatible with state-of-the-art proof systems without\\ntrusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP-SNARKs, evaluate\\ntheir performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial\\nimprovements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover\\ncosts and maintaining efficiency even for large-scale models. For example, for\\nthe VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from\\n11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML\\ntowards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and\\ncomplex ML models.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12055v1) |\\n| MMP for Enriques pairs and singular Enriques varieties | Francesco Antonio Denisi, \\u00c1ngel David R\\u00edos Ortiz, Nikolaos Tsakanikas, Zhixin Xie |   We introduce and study the class of primitive Enriques varieties, whose\\nsmooth members are Enriques manifolds.

Analysis of\\nresponses from 50 cybersecurity practitioners reveals an alarming reality: 44%\\nreport experiencing severe work-related stress and burnout, while an additional\\n28% are uncertain about their condition.

While most approaches in the Safe\\nReinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and\\nrobot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them\\nin complex real-world settings. Instead, model-based approaches that\\nincorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning\\nframework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on\\nthe real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot\\ndynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task-specific and hard\\nto obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to\\ncompute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long-term safety\\nrequirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe\\nexploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus\\non ensuring long-term safety and handling of uncertainty.

However, current methods often require hundreds to\\nthousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual\\nobservations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual\\nrepresentations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or\\ntrained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present\\nDynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual\\nrepresentations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a\\nlatent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of\\nimage embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without\\naugmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.\\nImportantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet\\ndatasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real\\nenvironments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly\\nimprove downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised\\nlearning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo\\nhold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,\\nand nearest neighbors.

Colin Hill, Jeffrey J.

While the y-distortion can be\\ndetected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the\\n$\\\\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\\\\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude\\nsmaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a\\nserious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\\\\mu$\\narises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the\\nprimordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \\\\approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here,\\nwe present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly\\ndetecting $\\\\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but\\nwith an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we\\noptimize the instrument's configuration to target $\\\\mu$ while robustly\\nmarginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike\\nFourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their\\nindividual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing\\nsignificant flexibility.

Our optimized\\nconfiguration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular\\nresolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally\\nmeasure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic\\ncorrection at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total\\nthermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12188v1) |\\n| Exoplanet accretion monitoring spectroscopic survey (ENTROPY) I.\\n  Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary-mass\\n  object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C.

A novel\\nPoisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.\\n(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering\\na fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of\\npartially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL\\nis the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large\\nimprovement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,\\nbased on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.\\n(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should\\nuse PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence\\nalso reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a\\nshortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that\\nthe comparison of log-likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al.

However,\\ndue to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across\\ndifferent MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In\\nthis study, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework, multiPI-TransBTS,\\nwhich integrates multi-physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.\\nThe model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi-modal\\nimaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor\\ncharacteristics. The multiPI-TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an\\nAdaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi-source, multi-scale feature\\ndecoder. The encoder incorporates a multi-branch architecture to separately\\nextract modality-specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module\\nfuses information from multiple sources using channel-wise and element-wise\\nattention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both\\ncommon and task-specific features through a Task-Specific Feature Introduction\\n(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),\\nTumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on\\nthe BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of\\nmultiPI-TransBTS over the state-of-the-art methods. The model consistently\\nachieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,\\nhighlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results\\nalso indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision\\nand recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a\\nsignificant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving\\nclinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12167v1) |\\n| Synchrotron self-Compton in a radiative-adiabatic fireball scenario:\\n  Modelling the multiwavelength observations in some Fermi/LAT bursts | Nissim Fraija, P.

Most of the wheelchair users\\nneed help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs\\nare not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this\\nproject, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair\\nusers. A robot with a WeHelp system has three modes, following mode, remote\\ncontrol mode and tele-operation mode. In the following mode, the robot follows\\nthe wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can\\nask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the\\nwheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech\\nrecognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode.\\nIn the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy\\nstick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs,\\nsuch as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high\\nshelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant\\ntakes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks\\nfor their needs.

However, accurate manual segmentation of\\nlesions is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. Given the\\nrising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods,\\nparticularly deep-learning-based approaches, have become increasingly more\\nrelevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation\\nof tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting,\\naddressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable\\nsolutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET\\nchallenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers\\n(FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers.

However, a\\nrobot's ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if\\nnaively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach-avoid\\ndynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a\\nsafety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human's behavior\\nas goal-driven but conditioned on the robot's plan, enabling us to capture\\ninfluence.

This paper\\npresents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large\\nlanguage models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their \\\"black box\\\" and static\\nnature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item\\nvisual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a\\nMultimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style\\nand color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis\\nfor personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the\\nopen-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability\\nto recommend stylish outfits.

While these improve performance, they often reach a\\nsaturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated\\nfeedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key\\nchallenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can\\nover-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and\\naddress errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to\\nidentify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding\\nhow many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too\\nsoon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose\\nMAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty\\nas easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard\\nones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error\\nlocalization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores.\\nMoreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with\\nthree agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on\\nstep-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure\\nsufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating\\nfurther rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5\\nand show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of\\nMAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by\\n4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with\\nbaselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our\\nablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe's RMs and multi-agent\\ncommunication.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147v1) |\\n| Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka |   Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string\\nprocessing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into\\nblocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence\\nof a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another\\noccurrence earlier in $T$.

Aref'eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov |   In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the\\nfive-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell models has played a crucial role.\\nTypically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while\\nadditional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A\\nmore general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field\\nrepresents spatial longitudinal-transverse anisotropy, while the third and\\nfourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We\\nconsider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero\\ntemperature and five functions at non-zero temperature. Maxwell field related\\nto the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,\\nwhereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.\\nWe demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of\\nthe seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations -- either the\\ndilaton or the vector potential equation -- follows from the Einstein equations\\nand the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi\\nidentity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress-energy\\ntensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is\\nprovided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to\\nthree Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis\\nshows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein\\nequations and the equation for the vector potential\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12131v1) |\\n| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components\\n  for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco-Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram |   Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data\\ntogether with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal\\ncomponents used. It is therefore important to determine the number of\\nsignificant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a\\nvariational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for\\nestimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of\\nsamples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This\\neliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of\\nprincipal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.\\nThis framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows\\nand columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),\\nand with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data\\nwith arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as\\ncultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our\\nmethod on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may\\nunderestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the\\nsynthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical\\ndataset. These results suggest that it is broadly applicable across the life\\nsciences.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12129v1) |\\n| Linguini: A benchmark for language-agnostic linguistic reasoning | Eduardo S\\u00e1nchez, Belen Alastruey, Christophe Ropers, Pontus Stenetorp, Mikel Artetxe, Marta R.

The test\\ncovers 894 questions grouped in 160 problems across 75 (mostly) extremely\\nlow-resource languages, extracted from the International Linguistic Olympiad\\ncorpus. To attain high accuracy on this benchmark, models don't need previous\\nknowledge of the tested language, as all the information needed to solve the\\nlinguistic puzzle is presented in the context. We find that, while all analyzed\\nmodels rank below 25% accuracy, there is a significant gap between open and\\nclosed models, with the best-performing proprietary model at 24.05% and the\\nbest-performing open model at 8.84%.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12126v1) |\\n| From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the\\n  primordial black hole reheating scenario | Guillem Dom\\u00e8nech, Jan Tr\\u00e4nkle |   We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs\\noriginate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight\\nPBHs with masses $M\\\\lesssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat\\nit via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate\\nwhether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH\\nreheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the\\ninitial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer\\nfunctions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and\\nisocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation\\nof state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH\\ndominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the\\nspectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive\\nto $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density\\nfluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance\\nas a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\\nobservations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the\\ninitial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we\\nfind that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several\\nfuture GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas,\\nespecially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any\\nearly matter-dominated universe scenario.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12125v1) |\\n| Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules | Anqi Zhang, Wilson S. Geisler |   Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We\\ninvestigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented\\ndisplays having well-separated potential target-object locations. Performance\\nwas compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption\\nthat the information from the different potential target locations is\\nstatistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than\\noptimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the\\nimplausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show\\nthat three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical\\nresults. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near\\noptimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the\\ncentral potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise\\ncauses search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These\\nfindings have far-reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks\\nand other identification tasks in humans and other animals.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12124v1) |\\n| Far-from-equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann\\n  approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows\\n  $v_n$ | Vincenzo Nugara, Vincenzo Greco, Salvatore Plumari |   We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal\\nsystem in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution\\nfunction and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system\\nsizes $R$ and interaction strength $\\\\eta/s$ and identify universality classes\\nbased upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each\\nof this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $\\\\hat\\n\\\\gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results\\nhighlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum\\nmoments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to\\na 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of\\ndifferent sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a\\nsimilar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse\\nflow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system\\nsize and $\\\\eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and\\ntheir response functions, along with the impact of the $\\\\eta/s$ and the system\\ntransverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in\\nmomentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow\\n$v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of\\nlarge opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems\\nevolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play\\nin this process.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12123v1) |\\n| Qwen2.5-Math Technical Report: Toward Mathematical Expert Model via\\n  Self-Improvement | An Yang, Beichen Zhang, Binyuan Hui, Bofei Gao, Bowen Yu, Chengpeng Li, Dayiheng Liu, Jianhong Tu, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin, Keming Lu, Mingfeng Xue, Runji Lin, Tianyu Liu, Xingzhang Ren, Zhenru Zhang |   In this report, we present a series of math-specific large language models:\\nQwen2.5-Math and Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct-1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the\\nQwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self-improvement\\nthroughout the entire pipeline, from pre-training and post-training to\\ninference: (1) During the pre-training phase, Qwen2-Math-Instruct is utilized\\nto generate large-scale, high-quality mathematical data. (2) In the\\npost-training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive\\nsampling from Qwen2-Math-Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative\\nevolution of data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model,\\nit's possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the\\nnext round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the\\nultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct.\\n(3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling,\\noptimizing the model's performance.\\n  Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced\\nmathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and\\nTool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR).

Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a\\nmoment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching\\nalgorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The\\nmeasurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight\\nto obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim\\nsimulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find\\nthe mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We\\nalso find the E-Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic\\nstructures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical\\nand X-Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to\\nmap large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of\\nthe cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the\\npeaks are similar to X-Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster\\nand show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12119v1) |\\n| Low Frame-rate Speech Codec: a Codec Designed for Fast High-quality\\n  Speech LLM Training and Inference | Edresson Casanova, Ryan Langman, Paarth Neekhara, Shehzeen Hussain, Jason Li, Subhankar Ghosh, Ante Juki\\u0107, Sang-gil Lee |   Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing\\nthrough audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the\\napplication of language modeling techniques to audio data.

Johnson |   Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide\\nstringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post-BBN (Big\\nBang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models\\nwith COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.\\nHere, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark\\nphoton conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous\\nworks only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the\\nchange to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon\\ndistortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the\\ndistortion has an opposite sign and a $\\\\simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We\\nfurthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover\\nthe redshift range $\\\\simeq 2\\\\times 10^6-4\\\\times 10^7$ between the $\\\\mu$-era and\\nthe end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints\\nfor dark photon masses in the range $10^{-4}\\\\,{\\\\rm eV}\\\\lesssim m_{\\\\rm\\ndp}\\\\lesssim 10^{-3}\\\\,{\\\\rm eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We\\ndemonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon\\nto dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $\\\\mu$-type distortion\\nindependent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study\\ndark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with\\nCMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12115v1) |\\n| Bi-objective trail-planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous\\n  environment | Cory M. Simon, Jeffrey Richley, Lucas Overbey, Darleen Perez-Lavin |   Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in\\nresource delivery, patrolling, information-gathering, agriculture, forest fire\\nfighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and\\nsearch-and-rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments -- with e.g.\\nrough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or\\ncapturing robots -- should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of\\nrisks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should\\ntake the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the\\nteam-level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward\\nfrom visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider\\nbi-objective trail-planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a\\nhazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed\\ngraph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of\\nsurvival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a\\nrobot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for\\nthe Pareto-optimal robot-team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team\\nobjectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive\\nthe mission. A human decision-maker can then select trail plans that balance,\\naccording to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony\\noptimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto-optimal set of\\nrobot team trail plans.

Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a\\npowerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,\\ncomplex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in\\nperformance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and\\nits innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer\\nknowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact\\nand efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application\\nacross various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and\\nhistorical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are\\nhighlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational\\nefficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical\\ndeployments in RS scenarios.

Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing\\nevidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,\\nthese growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,\\nmore and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth-dependent systems\\nand develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of\\n'growth dependence' still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,\\nwhich impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article\\nproposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the\\nconcept of 'growth dependence' across socio-economic systems. We provide a\\ngeneral definition consisting of four components that can be specified for\\ndifferent empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of\\nmeasurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions\\nor properties of the system under investigation. According to our general\\ndefinition, a socio-economic system is growth-dependent if it requires a\\nlong-term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to\\nmaintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen\\nnormative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to\\nthree areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:\\nemployment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies\\ndemonstrate that whether or not a system is growth-dependent hinges not only on\\nthe empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of\\nthe concept of growth dependence.

However, datasets distributed across each\\nclient in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can\\nbe globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly\\naffects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated\\nlearning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it\\nfails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data.\\nThis results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting\\nthe equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a\\nmethodology that considers classes holistically.

We\\nconsider a signal propagation model governed by this OU process. In this model,\\nan underlying signal propagates throughout a network consisting of $N$ linked\\nsensors located in space. We interpret the $n$-th component of the OU process\\nas the measurement of the propagating effect made by the $n$-th sensor. The\\nmatrix $\\\\mathbf B$ represents the sensor network structure: if $\\\\mathbf B$ has\\nfirst row $(b_1 \\\\ , \\\\ \\\\dots \\\\ , \\\\ b_N),$ where $b_1>0$ and $b_2 \\\\ , \\\\ \\\\dots \\\\\\n,\\\\ b_N \\\\le 0,$ then the magnitude of $b_p$ quantifies how receptive the $n$-th\\nsensor is to activity within the $(n+p-1)$-th sensor. Finally, the $(m,n)$-th\\nentry of the matrix $\\\\mathbf D = \\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol \\\\Sigma \\\\boldsymbol\\n\\\\Sigma^\\\\text T}{2}$ is the covariance of the component noises injected into the\\n$m$-th and $n$-th sensors. For different choices of $\\\\mathbf B$ and\\n$\\\\boldsymbol \\\\Sigma,$ we investigate whether Cyclicity Analysis enables us to\\nrecover the structure of network. Roughly speaking, Cyclicity Analysis studies\\nthe lead-lag dynamics pertaining to the components of a multivariate signal.

Recently, this\\ncuriosity has motivated the fMRI-to-image reconstruction task; given the fMRI\\ndata from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual\\nstimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent\\nDiffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex\\nvisual stimuli such as high-resolution natural images from vision datasets.\\nDespite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often\\nlack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.\\nConsequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere\\nvisuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs\\neffectively incorporate multi-modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,\\nand image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image\\ngenerations. Specifically, inspired by the two-streams hypothesis suggesting\\nthat perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain\\nregions, our framework, Brain-Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain\\nregions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from\\nsemantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information\\nregions, Brain-Streams provides accurate multi-modal guidance to LDMs. We\\nvalidate the reconstruction ability of Brain-Streams both quantitatively and\\nqualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI\\ndata.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12099v1) |\\n| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal\\n  execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huy\\u00ean Pham |   Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and\\nconstraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity\\nmarkets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general\\npropagator model under linear functional inequality constraints.

The task of\\nnext-best-view (NBV) planning is to infer the pose of the next viewpoint based\\non the current data, and gradually realize the complete three-dimensional\\nreconstruction. Many existing algorithms, however, suffer a large computational\\nburden due to the use of ray-casting. To address this, this paper proposes a\\nprojection-based NBV planning framework. It can select the next best view at an\\nextremely fast speed while ensuring the complete scanning of the object.\\nSpecifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into\\nellipsoids based on the voxel structure.Then, the next best view is selected\\nfrom the candidate views using a projection-based viewpoint quality evaluation\\nfunction in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy. This process\\nreplaces the ray-casting in voxel structures, significantly improving the\\ncomputational efficiency. Comparative experiments with other algorithms in a\\nsimulation environment show that the framework proposed in this paper can\\nachieve 10 times efficiency improvement on the basis of capturing roughly the\\nsame coverage.

Recent observations of decayless transverse oscillations have shown\\ntwo branches in the relationship between periods and loop lengths. One is a\\nlinear relationship, interpreted as a standing mode. The other shows almost no\\ncorrelation and has not yet been interpreted conclusively. Aims. We\\ninvestigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless\\noscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely\\nfollow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations\\nare standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations\\nwhere the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase\\nare randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal\\nby considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of\\ntelescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast\\nFourier transform.

Mixed-integer Model Predictive Control\\n(MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex\\nscheduling problems in agricultural irrigation.

To achieve this, our approach first introduces a\\nsimple data purification process to identify and select the most-likely clean\\ndata from the poisoned training dataset. The self-purified clean dataset is\\nthen used for activation clipping and fine-tuning only the last classification\\nlayer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation\\nclipping, and classifier fine-tuning, our mechanism PAD-FT demonstrates\\nsuperior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as\\nconfirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12072v1) |\\n| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing\\n  data in Irish sagas | P. MacCarron |   For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts\\nin order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify\\nsimilarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the\\nsignificance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture\\nrequires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and\\noften impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the\\nnetwork of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that\\nthe top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent\\nwith central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has\\nbeen lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust\\nto a large random removal of edges.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12071v1) |\\n| The repetition threshold for ternary rich words | James D.

Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by\\ntidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to\\ntheir proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the\\nTRAPPIST-1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In\\nthis work, we present the recent implementation of the co-planar tidal torque\\nand forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N-body code\\nPosidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using\\na tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of\\neach planet by taking into account their multi-layer internal structure\\ncomputed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets\\nare not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state.\\nPlanet-planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and\\ntides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a\\nresult, the sub-stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and\\nlong-timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with\\nperiods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12065v1) |\\n| Quantum Magic and Multi-Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei | Florian Br\\u00f6kemeier, S. Momme Hengstenberg, James W. T. Keeble, Caroline E. P. Robin, Federico Rocco, Martin J. Savage |   Motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the\\nquantum complexity of $p$-shell and $sd$-shell nuclei. Valence-space nuclear\\nshell-model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit\\nregisters using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$-shell and 24\\nqubits for the $sd$-shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement\\n($n$-tangles) and magic (non-stabilizerness) are determined. While exact\\nevaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of\\nactive nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex\\nnuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique\\nis introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed\\nnuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\\\\sim 8$ for some\\nnuclei. Significant multi-nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$-shell,\\ndominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of\\nmagic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on\\nthe path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion.\\nThese results indicate that quantum-computing resources will accelerate\\nprecision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12064v1) |\\n| Post-Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a\\n  massive, rotating object | Lorenzo Iorio |   The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the\\ngeneral relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring\\ncomponents of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are\\nanalytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level. To the Newtonian\\norder, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as\\nwell. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation\\nin space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the\\nprimary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first\\nto 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system\\nalong an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred\\nclose to the Sun's flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due\\nto the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of\\nmicroarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for\\nthe post-Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)\\nspacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of\\nthe latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current\\n(formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would\\nbring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the\\npredicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not\\nchanged by any of the post--Keplerian accelerations considered.

To address these\\nconcerns, recent research has focused on developing zero-knowledge machine\\nlearning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of\\nML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have\\nsubstantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily\\noptimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the\\nsubstantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the\\nmodel and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new\\nCommit-and-Prove SNARK (CP-SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that\\neffectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML\\npipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white-box use of the\\nunderlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic\\npolynomial commitment and only makes black-box use of the proof system. As a\\nresult, Artemis is compatible with state-of-the-art proof systems without\\ntrusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP-SNARKs, evaluate\\ntheir performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial\\nimprovements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover\\ncosts and maintaining efficiency even for large-scale models. For example, for\\nthe VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from\\n11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML\\ntowards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and\\ncomplex ML models.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12055v1) |\\n| MMP for Enriques pairs and singular Enriques varieties | Francesco Antonio Denisi, \\u00c1ngel David R\\u00edos Ortiz, Nikolaos Tsakanikas, Zhixin Xie |   We introduce and study the class of primitive Enriques varieties, whose\\nsmooth members are Enriques manifolds.

While most approaches in the Safe\\nReinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and\\nrobot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them\\nin complex real-world settings.

However, current methods often require hundreds to\\nthousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual\\nobservations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual\\nrepresentations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or\\ntrained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present\\nDynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual\\nrepresentations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a\\nlatent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of\\nimage embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without\\naugmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.\\nImportantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet\\ndatasets or cross-embodied datasets.

We combine a temporal\\nconvolutional encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer-based bottleneck\\nthat allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model\\nthe conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We\\nbenchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to\\n16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously. Our model\\noutperforms other approaches in terms of realism and diversity on different\\nmetrics and in a user study.

Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon |   Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a\\nperfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from\\nfundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\\\\mu$-distortion) to late-time\\nbaryonic feedback processes (y-distortion). While the y-distortion can be\\ndetected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the\\n$\\\\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\\\\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude\\nsmaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a\\nserious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\\\\mu$\\narises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the\\nprimordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \\\\approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here,\\nwe present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly\\ndetecting $\\\\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but\\nwith an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we\\noptimize the instrument's configuration to target $\\\\mu$ while robustly\\nmarginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike\\nFourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their\\nindividual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing\\nsignificant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the\\n$\\\\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\\\\mu$-distortion at $\\\\approx 5\\\\sigma$ (10$\\\\sigma$)\\nassuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission\\nduration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized\\nconfiguration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular\\nresolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally\\nmeasure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic\\ncorrection at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total\\nthermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12188v1) |\\n| Exoplanet accretion monitoring spectroscopic survey (ENTROPY) I.\\n  Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary-mass\\n  object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C.

In this paper, we\\npresent new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\\n(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a\\nmulti-wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the\\nM0.8$-$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring-like morphology. We\\nestimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring to be 79\\\"\\nand 154\\\", respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre\\ndistance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $> 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, a\\nmass of $\\\\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\\\\odot$, and an expansion speed of $\\\\sim$ 20 km\\ns$^{-1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($> 10^{51}$ erg) and\\nmomentum ($> 10^7$ M$_\\\\odot$ km s$^{-1}$). We discuss several possible causes\\nfor the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback\\nand large-scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the\\nM0.8$-$0.2 ring is a single high-energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain\\nthe observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have\\ntaken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which\\nwe now see as the M0.8$-$0.2 ring.

Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic\\n  reasoning | Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett |   Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting\\nreasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of\\ntasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted\\na quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own\\nevaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives\\nstrong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with\\nmuch smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the\\nanswer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the\\nquestion or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic\\noperations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of\\nCoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing\\nagainst tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic\\nexecution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our\\nresults indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance\\nwhile saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond\\nprompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation\\nacross the whole range of LLM applications.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183v1) |\\n| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs | Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T.

Due to the implementation challenges\\nassociated with directly training long-context models, many methods have been\\nproposed for extending models to handle long contexts.

Abkemeier, Edward L. Ionides |   Filtering algorithms are fundamental for inference on partially observed\\nstochastic dynamic systems, since they provide access to the likelihood\\nfunction and hence enable likelihood-based or Bayesian inference. A novel\\nPoisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.\\n(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering\\na fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of\\npartially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL\\nis the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large\\nimprovement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,\\nbased on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.\\n(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should\\nuse PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence\\nalso reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a\\nshortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that\\nthe comparison of log-likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al.

If PAL and the particle filter are applied\\nto the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears.

In\\nthis study, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework, multiPI-TransBTS,\\nwhich integrates multi-physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.\\nThe model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi-modal\\nimaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor\\ncharacteristics. The multiPI-TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an\\nAdaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi-source, multi-scale feature\\ndecoder. The encoder incorporates a multi-branch architecture to separately\\nextract modality-specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module\\nfuses information from multiple sources using channel-wise and element-wise\\nattention, ensuring effective feature recalibration.

On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical\\nand belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in\\nhuman behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE\\n(Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high-dimensional\\n(39-D) simulated human-robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline\\ngame-theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust\\nbaseline that treats the human as a worst-case adversary, a safety controller\\nthat does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy-function-based\\nsafety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage\\nthe influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing\\nthe robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate\\nduring task execution.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12153v1) |\\n| Decoding Style: Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Image-Guided Outfit\\n  Recommendation with Preference | Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan |   Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding\\nboth fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper\\npresents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large\\nlanguage models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their \\\"black box\\\" and static\\nnature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item\\nvisual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a\\nMultimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style\\nand color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis\\nfor personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the\\nopen-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability\\nto recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative\\nexamples is employed to enhance the LLM's decision-making process. This creates\\na self-enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in\\nline with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore\\ndataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill-in-the-blank,\\nand complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework's\\nability to generate stylish, trend-aligned outfit suggestions, continuously\\nimproving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our\\nproposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more\\ncohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the\\nproposed framework's potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate\\nsuggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit\\ngeneration.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12150v1) |\\n| Mechanical Wannier-Stark Ladder of Diamond Spin-Mechanical Lamb Wave\\n  Resonators | Philip Andrango, Hailin Wang |   We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier-Stark ladders of\\ndiamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with\\nultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin\\nproperties. Three nearest-neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric\\nconfigurations and a large range of coupling rates have been explored for the\\nrealization of Wannier-Stark ladders of LWRs, potentially enabling long-range\\nconnectivity between spin qubits through their interactions with mechanical\\nvibrations. Additional analysis on the effects of disorder indicates that the\\nproposed Wannier-Stark ladder can be robust against realistic experimental\\nimperfections.

While these improve performance, they often reach a\\nsaturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated\\nfeedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key\\nchallenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can\\nover-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and\\naddress errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to\\nidentify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding\\nhow many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too\\nsoon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose\\nMAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty\\nas easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard\\nones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error\\nlocalization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores.\\nMoreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with\\nthree agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on\\nstep-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure\\nsufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating\\nfurther rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5\\nand show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of\\nMAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by\\n4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with\\nbaselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our\\nablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe's RMs and multi-agent\\ncommunication.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147v1) |\\n| Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka |   Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string\\nprocessing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into\\nblocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence\\nof a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another\\noccurrence earlier in $T$. Due to numerous applications, LZ77 factorization is\\none of the most studied problems on strings. In the 47 years since its\\ninception, several algorithms were developed for different models of\\ncomputation, including parallel, GPU, external-memory, and quantum. Remarkably,\\nhowever, the complexity of the most basic variant is still not settled: All\\nexisting algorithms in the RAM model run in $\\\\Omega(n)$ time, which is a\\n$\\\\Theta(\\\\log n)$ factor away from the lower bound of $\\\\Omega(n/\\\\log n)$\\n(following from the necessity to read the input, which takes $\\\\Theta(n/\\\\log n)$\\nspace for $T\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}^{n}$).\\n  We present the first $o(n)$-time algorithm for LZ77 factorization, breaking\\nthe linear-time barrier present for nearly 50 years. For $T\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}^{n}$, our\\nalgorithm runs in $\\\\mathcal{O}(n/\\\\sqrt{\\\\log n})=o(n)$ time and uses the optimal\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(n/\\\\log n)$ working space.

The runtime and\\nworking space then become $\\\\mathcal{O}((n\\\\log\\\\sigma)/\\\\sqrt{\\\\log n})$ and\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(n/\\\\log_{\\\\sigma} n)$. To obtain our algorithm, we prove a more\\ngeneral result: For any constant $\\\\epsilon\\\\in(0,1)$ and $T\\\\in[0..\\\\sigma)^{n}$,\\nin $\\\\mathcal{O}((n\\\\log\\\\sigma)/\\\\sqrt{\\\\log n})$ time and using\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(n/\\\\log_{\\\\sigma}n)$ space, we can construct an\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(n/\\\\log_{\\\\sigma}n)$-size index that, given any $P=T[j..j+\\\\ell)$\\n(represented as $(j,\\\\ell)$), computes the leftmost occurrence of $P$ in $T$ in\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log^{\\\\epsilon}n)$ time.

Aref'eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov |   In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the\\nfive-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell models has played a crucial role.\\nTypically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while\\nadditional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A\\nmore general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field\\nrepresents spatial longitudinal-transverse anisotropy, while the third and\\nfourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We\\nconsider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero\\ntemperature and five functions at non-zero temperature. Maxwell field related\\nto the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,\\nwhereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.\\nWe demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of\\nthe seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations -- either the\\ndilaton or the vector potential equation -- follows from the Einstein equations\\nand the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi\\nidentity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress-energy\\ntensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is\\nprovided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to\\nthree Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis\\nshows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein\\nequations and the equation for the vector potential\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12131v1) |\\n| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components\\n  for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco-Portillo, Marcus W.

It is therefore important to determine the number of\\nsignificant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a\\nvariational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for\\nestimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of\\nsamples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This\\neliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of\\nprincipal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.\\nThis framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows\\nand columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),\\nand with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data\\nwith arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as\\ncultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our\\nmethod on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may\\nunderestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the\\nsynthetic data.

In this scenario, ultralight\\nPBHs with masses $M\\\\lesssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat\\nit via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate\\nwhether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH\\nreheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the\\ninitial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer\\nfunctions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and\\nisocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation\\nof state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH\\ndominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the\\nspectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive\\nto $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density\\nfluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance\\nas a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\\nobservations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the\\ninitial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced.

Our results\\nhighlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum\\nmoments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to\\na 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of\\ndifferent sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a\\nsimilar manner.

Johnson |   Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide\\nstringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post-BBN (Big\\nBang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models\\nwith COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.\\nHere, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark\\nphoton conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous\\nworks only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the\\nchange to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon\\ndistortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the\\ndistortion has an opposite sign and a $\\\\simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We\\nfurthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover\\nthe redshift range $\\\\simeq 2\\\\times 10^6-4\\\\times 10^7$ between the $\\\\mu$-era and\\nthe end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints\\nfor dark photon masses in the range $10^{-4}\\\\,{\\\\rm eV}\\\\lesssim m_{\\\\rm\\ndp}\\\\lesssim 10^{-3}\\\\,{\\\\rm eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We\\ndemonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon\\nto dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $\\\\mu$-type distortion\\nindependent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study\\ndark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with\\nCMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12115v1) |\\n| Bi-objective trail-planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous\\n  environment | Cory M. Simon, Jeffrey Richley, Lucas Overbey, Darleen Perez-Lavin |   Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in\\nresource delivery, patrolling, information-gathering, agriculture, forest fire\\nfighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and\\nsearch-and-rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments -- with e.g.\\nrough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or\\ncapturing robots -- should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of\\nrisks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should\\ntake the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the\\nteam-level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward\\nfrom visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider\\nbi-objective trail-planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a\\nhazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed\\ngraph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of\\nsurvival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a\\nrobot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for\\nthe Pareto-optimal robot-team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team\\nobjectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive\\nthe mission. A human decision-maker can then select trail plans that balance,\\naccording to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony\\noptimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto-optimal set of\\nrobot team trail plans. As a case study, we illustrate with an\\ninformation-gathering mission in an art museum.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12114v1) |\\n| Pareto Data Framework: Steps Towards Resource-Efficient Decision Making\\n  Using Minimum Viable Data (MVD) | Tashfain Ahmed, Josh Siegel |   This paper introduces the Pareto Data Framework, an approach for identifying\\nand selecting the Minimum Viable Data (MVD) required for enabling machine\\nlearning applications on constrained platforms such as embedded systems, mobile\\ndevices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We demonstrate that strategic\\ndata reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing\\nbandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies\\nMinimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource-constrained\\nenvironments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient\\npractices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and\\noverprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for\\noptimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data\\nrepresentation.

Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a\\npowerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,\\ncomplex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in\\nperformance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and\\nits innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer\\nknowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact\\nand efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application\\nacross various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and\\nhistorical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are\\nhighlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational\\nefficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical\\ndeployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of\\nKD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the\\nbreadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case\\nstudies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,\\nsuch as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review\\ndiscusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical\\nconstraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive\\noverview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS.

Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing\\nevidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,\\nthese growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,\\nmore and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth-dependent systems\\nand develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of\\n'growth dependence' still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,\\nwhich impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article\\nproposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the\\nconcept of 'growth dependence' across socio-economic systems. We provide a\\ngeneral definition consisting of four components that can be specified for\\ndifferent empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of\\nmeasurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions\\nor properties of the system under investigation. According to our general\\ndefinition, a socio-economic system is growth-dependent if it requires a\\nlong-term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to\\nmaintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen\\nnormative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to\\nthree areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:\\nemployment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies\\ndemonstrate that whether or not a system is growth-dependent hinges not only on\\nthe empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of\\nthe concept of growth dependence.

Computer-assisted Surgery systems\\nhave played a crucial role in improving the precision and safety of ESD\\nprocedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognition\\nof surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesion\\ncharacteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real-time\\nsurgical phase recognition algorithms.

However, datasets distributed across each\\nclient in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can\\nbe globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly\\naffects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated\\nlearning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it\\nfails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data.\\nThis results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting\\nthe equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a\\nmethodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,\\nwe propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the\\nlocal training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred\\noptimization, and feature decorrelation.

Recently, this\\ncuriosity has motivated the fMRI-to-image reconstruction task; given the fMRI\\ndata from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual\\nstimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent\\nDiffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex\\nvisual stimuli such as high-resolution natural images from vision datasets.\\nDespite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often\\nlack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.\\nConsequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere\\nvisuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs\\neffectively incorporate multi-modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,\\nand image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image\\ngenerations. Specifically, inspired by the two-streams hypothesis suggesting\\nthat perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain\\nregions, our framework, Brain-Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain\\nregions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from\\nsemantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information\\nregions, Brain-Streams provides accurate multi-modal guidance to LDMs. We\\nvalidate the reconstruction ability of Brain-Streams both quantitatively and\\nqualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI\\ndata.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12099v1) |\\n| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal\\n  execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huy\\u00ean Pham |   Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and\\nconstraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity\\nmarkets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general\\npropagator model under linear functional inequality constraints.

It remains unclear which element attributes have the\\ngreatest impact on agent performance, especially in environments that only\\nprovide a graphical representation (i.e., pixels). Here we find that the\\nordering in which elements are presented to the language model is surprisingly\\nimpactful--randomizing element ordering in a webpage degrades agent performance\\ncomparably to removing all visible text from an agent's state representation.\\nWhile a webpage provides a hierarchical ordering of elements, there is no such\\nordering when parsing elements directly from pixels. Moreover, as tasks become\\nmore challenging and models more sophisticated, our experiments suggest that\\nthe impact of ordering increases. Finding an effective ordering is non-trivial.\\nWe investigate the impact of various element ordering methods in web and\\ndesktop environments. We find that dimensionality reduction provides a viable\\nordering for pixel-only environments. We train a UI element detection model to\\nderive elements from pixels and apply our findings to an agent\\nbenchmark--OmniACT--where we only have access to pixels. Our method completes\\nmore than two times as many tasks on average relative to the previous\\nstate-of-the-art.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12089v2) |\\n| Quark saturation in the QCD phase diagram | Marcus Bluhm, Yuki Fujimoto, Larry McLerran, Marlene Nahrgang |   We determine the onset of Quarkyonic Matter corresponding to values of\\ntemperature and baryon chemical potential at which the quark phase space\\ndensity becomes one. At zero temperature for baryon chemical potentials below\\nthe mass of the Lambda baryon, only nucleons contribute to the quark density.\\nThis is different at finite temperature, where all baryons, mesons and their\\nresonances can be excited and thus add quarks to the phase space. The\\nprobability density to find a quark inside a hadron is determined using the\\nYukawa ansatz of the IdylliQ model of Quarkyonic Matter. We estimate separately\\nthe magnitude of the various contributions of nucleons, Delta baryons, pions as\\nwell as further hadrons and resonances. The uncertainty in the parametrization\\nof the probability density to find a quark inside a nucleon is spanned by\\nassuming that at zero temperature the transition density to Quarkyonic Matter\\nis between one and three times that of nuclear matter. Various predictions for\\na possible critical point associated with the chiral phase transition are found\\nclose to a triple point at which the line of the deconfinement transition and\\nthe curve associated with the transition to Quarkyonic Matter intersect. These\\nconsiderations provide an estimate for the region in the QCD phase diagram\\nwhere Quarkyonic Matter may be found.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12088v1) |\\n| Towards Interpretable End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Prediction:\\n  Utilizing Administrative Claims Data with Explainable AI Techniques | Yubo Li, Saba Al-Sayouri, Rema Padman |   This study explores the potential of utilizing administrative claims data,\\ncombined with advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, to\\npredict the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to End-Stage Renal\\nDisease (ESRD).

Agyeman, Jinfeng Liu, Sirish L. Shah |   Efficient water management in agriculture is important for mitigating the\\ngrowing freshwater scarcity crisis. Mixed-integer Model Predictive Control\\n(MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex\\nscheduling problems in agricultural irrigation. However, the computational\\ncomplexity of mixed-integer MPC still poses a significant challenge,\\nparticularly in large-scale applications. This study proposes an approach to\\nenhance the computational efficiency of mixed-integer MPC-based irrigation\\nschedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture\\ndynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed-integer linear\\nrepresentation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the\\nmixed-integer MPC-based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a\\nmixed-integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed-integer\\nnonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global\\noptimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated\\nthrough comparative studies conducted on a large-scale agricultural field\\nacross two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models,\\nspecifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used\\ntriggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU-based approach significantly\\nreduces solution times -- by up to 99.5\\\\% -- while achieving comparable\\nperformance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water\\nUse Efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, the ReLU-based approach maintains enhanced\\nperformance in terms of total prescribed irrigation and IWUE compared to the\\nwidely-used triggered irrigation scheduling method.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12082v1) |\\n| Design of Ligand-Binding Proteins with Atomic Flow Matching | Junqi Liu, Shaoning Li, Chence Shi, Zhi Yang, Jian Tang |   Designing novel proteins that bind to small molecules is a long-standing\\nchallenge in computational biology, with applications in developing catalysts,\\nbiosensors, and more. Current computational methods rely on the assumption that\\nthe binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible,\\nas conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon\\nbinding. In this work, we formulate proteins and molecules as unified\\nbiotokens, and present AtomFlow, a novel deep generative model under the\\nflow-matching framework for the design of ligand-binding proteins from the 2D\\ntarget molecular graph alone. Operating on representative atoms of biotokens,\\nAtomFlow captures the flexibility of ligands and generates ligand conformations\\nand protein backbone structures iteratively.

Wehrheim, Lucas Zinz, Johanna Rahm, Ashwin Balakrishnan, Alexandra Kaminer, Mike Heilemann, Matthias Kaschube |   Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at\\nthe nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological\\norganization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of\\nfluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses\\nremain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced\\nlaser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and\\nincreased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses.

R. Elder, Zhi-Feng Huang, T. Ala-Nissila |   In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene\\nstacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a\\nrecently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems\\nincorporating out-of-plane deformations and parameterized to match to density\\nfunctional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems.

Existing defense mechanisms\\ntypically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and\\ninvolve retraining an auxiliary model or fine-tuning the entire victim model.\\nHowever, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always\\nfeasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and\\nlightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD-FT, that does not require an\\nadditional clean dataset and fine-tunes only a very small part of the model to\\ndisinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a\\nsimple data purification process to identify and select the most-likely clean\\ndata from the poisoned training dataset. The self-purified clean dataset is\\nthen used for activation clipping and fine-tuning only the last classification\\nlayer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation\\nclipping, and classifier fine-tuning, our mechanism PAD-FT demonstrates\\nsuperior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as\\nconfirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12072v1) |\\n| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing\\n  data in Irish sagas | P.

Valence-space nuclear\\nshell-model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit\\nregisters using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$-shell and 24\\nqubits for the $sd$-shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement\\n($n$-tangles) and magic (non-stabilizerness) are determined. While exact\\nevaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of\\nactive nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex\\nnuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique\\nis introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed\\nnuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\\\\sim 8$ for some\\nnuclei.

To address these\\nconcerns, recent research has focused on developing zero-knowledge machine\\nlearning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of\\nML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have\\nsubstantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily\\noptimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the\\nsubstantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the\\nmodel and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new\\nCommit-and-Prove SNARK (CP-SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that\\neffectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML\\npipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white-box use of the\\nunderlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic\\npolynomial commitment and only makes black-box use of the proof system. As a\\nresult, Artemis is compatible with state-of-the-art proof systems without\\ntrusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP-SNARKs, evaluate\\ntheir performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial\\nimprovements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover\\ncosts and maintaining efficiency even for large-scale models.

While most approaches in the Safe\\nReinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and\\nrobot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them\\nin complex real-world settings. Instead, model-based approaches that\\nincorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning\\nframework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on\\nthe real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot\\ndynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task-specific and hard\\nto obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to\\ncompute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long-term safety\\nrequirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe\\nexploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus\\non ensuring long-term safety and handling of uncertainty.

However, current methods often require hundreds to\\nthousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual\\nobservations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual\\nrepresentations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or\\ntrained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present\\nDynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual\\nrepresentations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a\\nlatent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of\\nimage embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without\\naugmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.\\nImportantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet\\ndatasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real\\nenvironments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly\\nimprove downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised\\nlearning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo\\nhold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,\\nand nearest neighbors.

Colin Hill, Jeffrey J.

While the y-distortion can be\\ndetected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the\\n$\\\\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\\\\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude\\nsmaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a\\nserious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\\\\mu$\\narises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the\\nprimordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \\\\approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here,\\nwe present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly\\ndetecting $\\\\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but\\nwith an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we\\noptimize the instrument's configuration to target $\\\\mu$ while robustly\\nmarginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike\\nFourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their\\nindividual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing\\nsignificant flexibility.

Our optimized\\nconfiguration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular\\nresolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally\\nmeasure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic\\ncorrection at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total\\nthermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12188v1) |\\n| Exoplanet accretion monitoring spectroscopic survey (ENTROPY) I.\\n  Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary-mass\\n  object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C.

Subsequently, we\\nshow that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable\\none-dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and\\nmoreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt.\\nMore broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one 'machine' to simulate\\nanother, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low-complexity 'encoders' and\\n'decoders' to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system\\nbeing simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical\\nsystem leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity\\ntheory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12179v1) |\\n| Poisson approximate likelihood compared to the particle filter | Yize Hao, Aaron A. Abkemeier, Edward L. Ionides |   Filtering algorithms are fundamental for inference on partially observed\\nstochastic dynamic systems, since they provide access to the likelihood\\nfunction and hence enable likelihood-based or Bayesian inference. A novel\\nPoisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.\\n(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering\\na fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of\\npartially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL\\nis the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large\\nimprovement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,\\nbased on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.\\n(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should\\nuse PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence\\nalso reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a\\nshortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that\\nthe comparison of log-likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al. (2023) is\\nflawed because their PAL calculations were carried out using a dataset scaled\\ndifferently from the previous study. If PAL and the particle filter are applied\\nto the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears. On simulations\\nwhere the model is correctly specified, the particle filter outperforms PAL.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12173v1) |\\n| You Only Read Once (YORO): Learning to Internalize Database Knowledge\\n  for Text-to-SQL | Hideo Kobayashi, Wuwei Lan, Peng Shi, Shuaichen Chang, Jiang Guo, Henghui Zhu, Zhiguo Wang, Patrick Ng |   While significant progress has been made on the text-to-SQL task, recent\\nsolutions repeatedly encode the same database schema for every question,\\nresulting in unnecessary high inference cost and often overlooking crucial\\ndatabase knowledge.

However,\\ndue to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across\\ndifferent MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In\\nthis study, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework, multiPI-TransBTS,\\nwhich integrates multi-physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.\\nThe model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi-modal\\nimaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor\\ncharacteristics. The multiPI-TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an\\nAdaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi-source, multi-scale feature\\ndecoder. The encoder incorporates a multi-branch architecture to separately\\nextract modality-specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module\\nfuses information from multiple sources using channel-wise and element-wise\\nattention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both\\ncommon and task-specific features through a Task-Specific Feature Introduction\\n(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),\\nTumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on\\nthe BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of\\nmultiPI-TransBTS over the state-of-the-art methods. The model consistently\\nachieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,\\nhighlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results\\nalso indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision\\nand recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a\\nsignificant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving\\nclinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12167v1) |\\n| Synchrotron self-Compton in a radiative-adiabatic fireball scenario:\\n  Modelling the multiwavelength observations in some Fermi/LAT bursts | Nissim Fraija, P.

In the standard GRB afterglow\\nmodel, the relativistic homogeneous shock is usually considered to be fully\\nadiabatic, however, it could be partially radiative.

In the following mode, the robot follows\\nthe wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can\\nask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the\\nwheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech\\nrecognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode.\\nIn the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy\\nstick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs,\\nsuch as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high\\nshelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant\\ntakes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks\\nfor their needs.

These IFSs\\nexhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are\\ntopologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries.

In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach-avoid\\ndynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a\\nsafety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human's behavior\\nas goal-driven but conditioned on the robot's plan, enabling us to capture\\ninfluence.

This paper\\npresents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large\\nlanguage models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their \\\"black box\\\" and static\\nnature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item\\nvisual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a\\nMultimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style\\nand color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis\\nfor personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the\\nopen-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability\\nto recommend stylish outfits.

While these improve performance, they often reach a\\nsaturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated\\nfeedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key\\nchallenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can\\nover-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and\\naddress errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to\\nidentify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding\\nhow many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too\\nsoon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose\\nMAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty\\nas easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard\\nones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error\\nlocalization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores.\\nMoreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with\\nthree agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on\\nstep-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure\\nsufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating\\nfurther rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5\\nand show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of\\nMAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by\\n4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with\\nbaselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations.

However, sparse computation challenges\\ntraditional training practices, as discrete expert routing hinders standard\\nbackpropagation and thus gradient-based optimization, which are the cornerstone\\nof deep learning.

However, each approach has its own limitations,\\nmaking it less effective to rely solely on either one. An emerging and\\npromising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractive\\nsummarization methods. Despite the plethora of studies in this domain, research\\non the combined methodology remains scarce, particularly in the context of\\nVietnamese language processing. This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDS\\nframework leveraging a two-component pipeline architecture that integrates\\nextractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs an\\nextractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This is\\nachieved by a modification of the pre-trained BERT network, which derives\\nsemantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet network\\nstructures. The second component utilizes the VBD-LLaMA2-7B-50b model for\\nabstractive summarization, ultimately generating the final summary document.\\nOur proposed framework demonstrates a positive performance, attaining ROUGE-2\\nscores of 39.6% on the VN-MDS dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art\\nbaselines.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12134v1) |\\n| Einstein-dilaton-four-Maxwell Holographic Anisotropic Models | Irina Ya. Aref'eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov |   In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the\\nfive-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell models has played a crucial role.\\nTypically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while\\nadditional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A\\nmore general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field\\nrepresents spatial longitudinal-transverse anisotropy, while the third and\\nfourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We\\nconsider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero\\ntemperature and five functions at non-zero temperature. Maxwell field related\\nto the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,\\nwhereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.\\nWe demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of\\nthe seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations -- either the\\ndilaton or the vector potential equation -- follows from the Einstein equations\\nand the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi\\nidentity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress-energy\\ntensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is\\nprovided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to\\nthree Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis\\nshows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein\\nequations and the equation for the vector potential\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12131v1) |\\n| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components\\n  for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco-Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram |   Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data\\ntogether with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal\\ncomponents used. It is therefore important to determine the number of\\nsignificant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a\\nvariational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for\\nestimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of\\nsamples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This\\neliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of\\nprincipal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.\\nThis framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows\\nand columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),\\nand with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data\\nwith arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as\\ncultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our\\nmethod on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may\\nunderestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the\\nsynthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical\\ndataset. These results suggest that it is broadly applicable across the life\\nsciences.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12129v1) |\\n| Linguini: A benchmark for language-agnostic linguistic reasoning | Eduardo S\\u00e1nchez, Belen Alastruey, Christophe Ropers, Pontus Stenetorp, Mikel Artetxe, Marta R.

To attain high accuracy on this benchmark, models don't need previous\\nknowledge of the tested language, as all the information needed to solve the\\nlinguistic puzzle is presented in the context.

In this scenario, ultralight\\nPBHs with masses $M\\\\lesssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat\\nit via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate\\nwhether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH\\nreheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the\\ninitial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer\\nfunctions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and\\nisocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation\\nof state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH\\ndominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the\\nspectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive\\nto $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density\\nfluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance\\nas a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\\nobservations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the\\ninitial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we\\nfind that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several\\nfuture GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope.

Geisler |   Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We\\ninvestigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented\\ndisplays having well-separated potential target-object locations. Performance\\nwas compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption\\nthat the information from the different potential target locations is\\nstatistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than\\noptimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the\\nimplausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show\\nthat three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical\\nresults. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near\\noptimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the\\ncentral potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise\\ncauses search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These\\nfindings have far-reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks\\nand other identification tasks in humans and other animals.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12124v1) |\\n| Far-from-equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann\\n  approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows\\n  $v_n$ | Vincenzo Nugara, Vincenzo Greco, Salvatore Plumari |   We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal\\nsystem in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution\\nfunction and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system\\nsizes $R$ and interaction strength $\\\\eta/s$ and identify universality classes\\nbased upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each\\nof this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $\\\\hat\\n\\\\gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results\\nhighlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum\\nmoments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to\\na 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of\\ndifferent sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a\\nsimilar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse\\nflow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system\\nsize and $\\\\eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and\\ntheir response functions, along with the impact of the $\\\\eta/s$ and the system\\ntransverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in\\nmomentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow\\n$v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of\\nlarge opacity.

(2) In the\\npost-training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive\\nsampling from Qwen2-Math-Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative\\nevolution of data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT).

Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a\\nmoment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching\\nalgorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The\\nmeasurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight\\nto obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim\\nsimulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find\\nthe mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We\\nalso find the E-Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic\\nstructures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical\\nand X-Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to\\nmap large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of\\nthe cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the\\npeaks are similar to X-Ray.

This has been used to constrain dark photon models\\nwith COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.\\nHere, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark\\nphoton conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous\\nworks only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the\\nchange to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon\\ndistortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the\\ndistortion has an opposite sign and a $\\\\simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We\\nfurthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover\\nthe redshift range $\\\\simeq 2\\\\times 10^6-4\\\\times 10^7$ between the $\\\\mu$-era and\\nthe end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints\\nfor dark photon masses in the range $10^{-4}\\\\,{\\\\rm eV}\\\\lesssim m_{\\\\rm\\ndp}\\\\lesssim 10^{-3}\\\\,{\\\\rm eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We\\ndemonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon\\nto dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $\\\\mu$-type distortion\\nindependent of the conversion redshift.

Robot teams traversing hazardous environments -- with e.g.\\nrough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or\\ncapturing robots -- should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of\\nrisks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should\\ntake the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the\\nteam-level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward\\nfrom visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider\\nbi-objective trail-planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a\\nhazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed\\ngraph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of\\nsurvival.

Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing\\nevidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,\\nthese growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,\\nmore and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth-dependent systems\\nand develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of\\n'growth dependence' still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,\\nwhich impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article\\nproposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the\\nconcept of 'growth dependence' across socio-economic systems. We provide a\\ngeneral definition consisting of four components that can be specified for\\ndifferent empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of\\nmeasurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions\\nor properties of the system under investigation.

To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to\\nthree areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:\\nemployment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies\\ndemonstrate that whether or not a system is growth-dependent hinges not only on\\nthe empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of\\nthe concept of growth dependence.

However, datasets distributed across each\\nclient in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can\\nbe globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly\\naffects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated\\nlearning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it\\nfails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data.\\nThis results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting\\nthe equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a\\nmethodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,\\nwe propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the\\nlocal training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred\\noptimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state-of-the-art\\nmethods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed\\ndistribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10-LT and\\nCIFAR-100-LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of\\nmodel performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long-tailed\\ndistribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12105v1) |\\n| Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error\\n  Detection | Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia |   Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications. Doing\\nso requires overcoming the noise present on today's hardware. The quantum\\napproximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling\\nup due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup\\nover state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems. However,\\nachieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require\\nfault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant\\nimplementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection\\ncode. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the\\nalgorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with\\nup to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we\\npropose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance, and use it\\nto characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance\\nto future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our\\nmodel can be used to determine necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform\\nGoemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware.

Recently, this\\ncuriosity has motivated the fMRI-to-image reconstruction task; given the fMRI\\ndata from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual\\nstimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent\\nDiffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex\\nvisual stimuli such as high-resolution natural images from vision datasets.\\nDespite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often\\nlack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.\\nConsequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere\\nvisuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs\\neffectively incorporate multi-modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,\\nand image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image\\ngenerations. Specifically, inspired by the two-streams hypothesis suggesting\\nthat perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain\\nregions, our framework, Brain-Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain\\nregions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from\\nsemantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information\\nregions, Brain-Streams provides accurate multi-modal guidance to LDMs. We\\nvalidate the reconstruction ability of Brain-Streams both quantitatively and\\nqualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI\\ndata.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12099v1) |\\n| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal\\n  execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huy\\u00ean Pham |   Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and\\nconstraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity\\nmarkets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general\\npropagator model under linear functional inequality constraints.

We\\ninvestigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless\\noscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely\\nfollow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations\\nare standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations\\nwhere the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase\\nare randomly drawn.

This\\nenables operation in diverse and varying refractive fluids, given only the\\ncamera calibration in air. The refractive index is estimated online as a state\\nvariable of a monocular visual-inertial odometry framework in an iterative\\nformulation using the proposed camera model. The method was verified on data\\ncollected using an underwater robot traversing inside a pool. The evaluations\\ndemonstrate convergence to the ideal refractive index for water despite\\nsignificant perturbations in the initialization.

R. Elder, Zhi-Feng Huang, T. Ala-Nissila |   In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene\\nstacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a\\nrecently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems\\nincorporating out-of-plane deformations and parameterized to match to density\\nfunctional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems. The\\nspecific configuration considered consists of one monolayer containing four\\n$5|7$ dislocations (i.e., two dislocation dipoles) sandwiched in between\\nperfect graphene layers. The study reveals how the strain field from the\\ndislocations in the defected layer leads to out-of-plane deformations that in\\nturn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are\\nmade for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a\\ndefect-free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and\\nsystem size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by\\nroughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence\\nacross the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height\\nprofiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12073v1) |\\n| PAD-FT: A Lightweight Defense for Backdoor Attacks via Data Purification\\n  and Fine-Tuning | Yukai Xu, Yujie Gu, Kouichi Sakurai |   Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks,\\nparticularly as recent advancements have led to increasingly subtle\\nimplantation, making the defense more challenging. Existing defense mechanisms\\ntypically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and\\ninvolve retraining an auxiliary model or fine-tuning the entire victim model.\\nHowever, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always\\nfeasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and\\nlightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD-FT, that does not require an\\nadditional clean dataset and fine-tunes only a very small part of the model to\\ndisinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a\\nsimple data purification process to identify and select the most-likely clean\\ndata from the poisoned training dataset. The self-purified clean dataset is\\nthen used for activation clipping and fine-tuning only the last classification\\nlayer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation\\nclipping, and classifier fine-tuning, our mechanism PAD-FT demonstrates\\nsuperior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as\\nconfirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12072v1) |\\n| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing\\n  data in Irish sagas | P. MacCarron |   For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts\\nin order to quantitatively compare them.

Analysing a full mythology of a culture\\nrequires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and\\noften impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the\\nnetwork of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters.

Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by\\ntidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to\\ntheir proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the\\nTRAPPIST-1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In\\nthis work, we present the recent implementation of the co-planar tidal torque\\nand forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N-body code\\nPosidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using\\na tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of\\neach planet by taking into account their multi-layer internal structure\\ncomputed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets\\nare not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state.\\nPlanet-planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and\\ntides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a\\nresult, the sub-stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and\\nlong-timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with\\nperiods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12065v1) |\\n| Quantum Magic and Multi-Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei | Florian Br\\u00f6kemeier, S. Momme Hengstenberg, James W. T. Keeble, Caroline E. P. Robin, Federico Rocco, Martin J. Savage |   Motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the\\nquantum complexity of $p$-shell and $sd$-shell nuclei. Valence-space nuclear\\nshell-model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit\\nregisters using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$-shell and 24\\nqubits for the $sd$-shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement\\n($n$-tangles) and magic (non-stabilizerness) are determined. While exact\\nevaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of\\nactive nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex\\nnuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique\\nis introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed\\nnuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\\\\sim 8$ for some\\nnuclei. Significant multi-nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$-shell,\\ndominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of\\nmagic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on\\nthe path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion.\\nThese results indicate that quantum-computing resources will accelerate\\nprecision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12064v1) |\\n| Post-Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a\\n  massive, rotating object | Lorenzo Iorio |   The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the\\ngeneral relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring\\ncomponents of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are\\nanalytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level. To the Newtonian\\norder, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as\\nwell. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation\\nin space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the\\nprimary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first\\nto 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system\\nalong an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred\\nclose to the Sun's flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due\\nto the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of\\nmicroarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for\\nthe post-Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)\\nspacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of\\nthe latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current\\n(formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would\\nbring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the\\npredicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not\\nchanged by any of the post--Keplerian accelerations considered.

To address these\\nconcerns, recent research has focused on developing zero-knowledge machine\\nlearning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of\\nML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have\\nsubstantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily\\noptimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the\\nsubstantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the\\nmodel and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new\\nCommit-and-Prove SNARK (CP-SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that\\neffectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML\\npipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white-box use of the\\nunderlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic\\npolynomial commitment and only makes black-box use of the proof system. As a\\nresult, Artemis is compatible with state-of-the-art proof systems without\\ntrusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP-SNARKs, evaluate\\ntheir performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial\\nimprovements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover\\ncosts and maintaining efficiency even for large-scale models. For example, for\\nthe VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from\\n11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML\\ntowards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and\\ncomplex ML models.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12055v1) |\\n| MMP for Enriques pairs and singular Enriques varieties | Francesco Antonio Denisi, \\u00c1ngel David R\\u00edos Ortiz, Nikolaos Tsakanikas, Zhixin Xie |   We introduce and study the class of primitive Enriques varieties, whose\\nsmooth members are Enriques manifolds.

However, current methods often require hundreds to\\nthousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual\\nobservations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual\\nrepresentations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or\\ntrained directly through a behavior cloning objective.

The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary\\nPosition Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional\\ninformation across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for\\nprocessing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception\\ncapabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL\\ninvestigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By\\nscaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the\\namount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive\\nperformance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to\\nleading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal\\nbenchmarks, outperforming other generalist models.

BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses\\nand 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance\\nof deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to\\nintegrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and\\nperformance. However, widely-used C++-based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,\\ng$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries\\nlike PyTorch.

Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon |   Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a\\nperfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from\\nfundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\\\\mu$-distortion) to late-time\\nbaryonic feedback processes (y-distortion). While the y-distortion can be\\ndetected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the\\n$\\\\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\\\\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude\\nsmaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a\\nserious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\\\\mu$\\narises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the\\nprimordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \\\\approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here,\\nwe present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly\\ndetecting $\\\\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but\\nwith an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we\\noptimize the instrument's configuration to target $\\\\mu$ while robustly\\nmarginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike\\nFourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their\\nindividual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing\\nsignificant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the\\n$\\\\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\\\\mu$-distortion at $\\\\approx 5\\\\sigma$ (10$\\\\sigma$)\\nassuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission\\nduration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized\\nconfiguration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular\\nresolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally\\nmeasure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic\\ncorrection at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total\\nthermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12188v1) |\\n| Exoplanet accretion monitoring spectroscopic survey (ENTROPY) I.\\n  Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary-mass\\n  object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C.

Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic\\n  reasoning | Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett |   Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting\\nreasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of\\ntasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted\\na quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own\\nevaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives\\nstrong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with\\nmuch smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the\\nanswer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the\\nquestion or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic\\noperations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of\\nCoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing\\nagainst tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic\\nexecution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our\\nresults indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance\\nwhile saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond\\nprompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation\\nacross the whole range of LLM applications.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183v1) |\\n| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs | Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T.

A novel\\nPoisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.\\n(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering\\na fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of\\npartially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL\\nis the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large\\nimprovement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,\\nbased on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.\\n(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should\\nuse PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence\\nalso reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a\\nshortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that\\nthe comparison of log-likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al.

We first learn audio\\nfeatures in a self-supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects.\\nBy incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned\\naudio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle\\nmotion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer-based architecture\\nthat learns expression features, capturing long-range facial expressions and\\ndisentangling them from the speech-specific mouth movements. Through\\nquantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can\\nsynthesize high-fidelity talking face videos, achieving state-of-the-art facial\\nexpression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12156v1) |\\n| Autopet III challenge: Incorporating anatomical knowledge into nnUNet\\n  for lesion segmentation in PET/CT | Hamza Kalisch, Fabian H\\u00f6rst, Ken Herrmann, Jens Kleesiek, Constantin Seibold |   Lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging is essential for precise tumor\\ncharacterization, which supports personalized treatment planning and enhances\\ndiagnostic precision in oncology. However, accurate manual segmentation of\\nlesions is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. Given the\\nrising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods,\\nparticularly deep-learning-based approaches, have become increasingly more\\nrelevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation\\nof tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting,\\naddressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable\\nsolutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET\\nchallenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers\\n(FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers. To this extent, we developed a\\nclassifier that identifies the tracer of the given PET/CT based on the Maximum\\nIntensity Projection of the PET scan. We trained two individual\\nnnUNet-ensembles for each tracer where anatomical labels are included as a\\nmulti-label task to enhance the model's performance. Our final submission\\nachieves cross-validation Dice scores of 76.90% and 61.33% for the publicly\\navailable FDG and PSMA datasets, respectively.

However, a\\nrobot's ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if\\nnaively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach-avoid\\ndynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a\\nsafety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human's behavior\\nas goal-driven but conditioned on the robot's plan, enabling us to capture\\ninfluence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical\\nand belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in\\nhuman behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE\\n(Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high-dimensional\\n(39-D) simulated human-robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline\\ngame-theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust\\nbaseline that treats the human as a worst-case adversary, a safety controller\\nthat does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy-function-based\\nsafety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage\\nthe influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing\\nthe robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate\\nduring task execution.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12153v1) |\\n| Decoding Style: Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Image-Guided Outfit\\n  Recommendation with Preference | Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan |   Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding\\nboth fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper\\npresents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large\\nlanguage models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their \\\"black box\\\" and static\\nnature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item\\nvisual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a\\nMultimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style\\nand color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis\\nfor personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the\\nopen-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability\\nto recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative\\nexamples is employed to enhance the LLM's decision-making process. This creates\\na self-enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in\\nline with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore\\ndataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill-in-the-blank,\\nand complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework's\\nability to generate stylish, trend-aligned outfit suggestions, continuously\\nimproving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our\\nproposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more\\ncohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the\\nproposed framework's potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate\\nsuggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit\\ngeneration.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12150v1) |\\n| Mechanical Wannier-Stark Ladder of Diamond Spin-Mechanical Lamb Wave\\n  Resonators | Philip Andrango, Hailin Wang |   We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier-Stark ladders of\\ndiamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with\\nultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin\\nproperties. Three nearest-neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric\\nconfigurations and a large range of coupling rates have been explored for the\\nrealization of Wannier-Stark ladders of LWRs, potentially enabling long-range\\nconnectivity between spin qubits through their interactions with mechanical\\nvibrations.

While these improve performance, they often reach a\\nsaturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated\\nfeedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key\\nchallenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can\\nover-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and\\naddress errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to\\nidentify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding\\nhow many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too\\nsoon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose\\nMAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty\\nas easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard\\nones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error\\nlocalization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores.\\nMoreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with\\nthree agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on\\nstep-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure\\nsufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating\\nfurther rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5\\nand show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of\\nMAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by\\n4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with\\nbaselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our\\nablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe's RMs and multi-agent\\ncommunication.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147v1) |\\n| Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka |   Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string\\nprocessing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into\\nblocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence\\nof a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another\\noccurrence earlier in $T$. Due to numerous applications, LZ77 factorization is\\none of the most studied problems on strings. In the 47 years since its\\ninception, several algorithms were developed for different models of\\ncomputation, including parallel, GPU, external-memory, and quantum. Remarkably,\\nhowever, the complexity of the most basic variant is still not settled: All\\nexisting algorithms in the RAM model run in $\\\\Omega(n)$ time, which is a\\n$\\\\Theta(\\\\log n)$ factor away from the lower bound of $\\\\Omega(n/\\\\log n)$\\n(following from the necessity to read the input, which takes $\\\\Theta(n/\\\\log n)$\\nspace for $T\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}^{n}$).\\n  We present the first $o(n)$-time algorithm for LZ77 factorization, breaking\\nthe linear-time barrier present for nearly 50 years. For $T\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}^{n}$, our\\nalgorithm runs in $\\\\mathcal{O}(n/\\\\sqrt{\\\\log n})=o(n)$ time and uses the optimal\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(n/\\\\log n)$ working space.

The runtime and\\nworking space then become $\\\\mathcal{O}((n\\\\log\\\\sigma)/\\\\sqrt{\\\\log n})$ and\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(n/\\\\log_{\\\\sigma} n)$. To obtain our algorithm, we prove a more\\ngeneral result: For any constant $\\\\epsilon\\\\in(0,1)$ and $T\\\\in[0..\\\\sigma)^{n}$,\\nin $\\\\mathcal{O}((n\\\\log\\\\sigma)/\\\\sqrt{\\\\log n})$ time and using\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(n/\\\\log_{\\\\sigma}n)$ space, we can construct an\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(n/\\\\log_{\\\\sigma}n)$-size index that, given any $P=T[j..j+\\\\ell)$\\n(represented as $(j,\\\\ell)$), computes the leftmost occurrence of $P$ in $T$ in\\n$\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log^{\\\\epsilon}n)$ time.

It is therefore important to determine the number of\\nsignificant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a\\nvariational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for\\nestimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of\\nsamples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features.

We investigate\\nwhether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH\\nreheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the\\ninitial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer\\nfunctions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and\\nisocurvature initial conditions.

Dutta, J. R. Peterson, T. Rose, M. Cianfaglione, A. Bonafede, G. Li, G. Sembroski |   We present a weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 2390 at z =\\n0.23 using second moment shape measurements made in 411 short 60s exposures.\\nThe exposures are obtained in three broadband photometric filters (g, r, i)\\nusing WIYN-ODI. Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a\\nmoment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching\\nalgorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The\\nmeasurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight\\nto obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim\\nsimulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find\\nthe mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We\\nalso find the E-Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic\\nstructures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical\\nand X-Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to\\nmap large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of\\nthe cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the\\npeaks are similar to X-Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster\\nand show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12119v1) |\\n| Low Frame-rate Speech Codec: a Codec Designed for Fast High-quality\\n  Speech LLM Training and Inference | Edresson Casanova, Ryan Langman, Paarth Neekhara, Shehzeen Hussain, Jason Li, Subhankar Ghosh, Ante Juki\\u0107, Sang-gil Lee |   Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing\\nthrough audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the\\napplication of language modeling techniques to audio data. However, audio\\ncodecs often operate at high frame rates, resulting in slow training and\\ninference, especially for autoregressive models. To address this challenge, we\\npresent the Low Frame-rate Speech Codec (LFSC): a neural audio codec that\\nleverages finite scalar quantization and adversarial training with large speech\\nlanguage models to achieve high-quality audio compression with a 1.89 kbps\\nbitrate and 21.5 frames per second.

Johnson |   Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide\\nstringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post-BBN (Big\\nBang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models\\nwith COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.\\nHere, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark\\nphoton conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous\\nworks only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the\\nchange to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon\\ndistortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the\\ndistortion has an opposite sign and a $\\\\simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We\\nfurthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover\\nthe redshift range $\\\\simeq 2\\\\times 10^6-4\\\\times 10^7$ between the $\\\\mu$-era and\\nthe end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints\\nfor dark photon masses in the range $10^{-4}\\\\,{\\\\rm eV}\\\\lesssim m_{\\\\rm\\ndp}\\\\lesssim 10^{-3}\\\\,{\\\\rm eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We\\ndemonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon\\nto dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $\\\\mu$-type distortion\\nindependent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study\\ndark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with\\nCMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12115v1) |\\n| Bi-objective trail-planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous\\n  environment | Cory M. Simon, Jeffrey Richley, Lucas Overbey, Darleen Perez-Lavin |   Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in\\nresource delivery, patrolling, information-gathering, agriculture, forest fire\\nfighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and\\nsearch-and-rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments -- with e.g.\\nrough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or\\ncapturing robots -- should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of\\nrisks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should\\ntake the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the\\nteam-level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward\\nfrom visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider\\nbi-objective trail-planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a\\nhazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed\\ngraph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of\\nsurvival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a\\nrobot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for\\nthe Pareto-optimal robot-team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team\\nobjectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive\\nthe mission. A human decision-maker can then select trail plans that balance,\\naccording to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony\\noptimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto-optimal set of\\nrobot team trail plans. As a case study, we illustrate with an\\ninformation-gathering mission in an art museum.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12114v1) |\\n| Pareto Data Framework: Steps Towards Resource-Efficient Decision Making\\n  Using Minimum Viable Data (MVD) | Tashfain Ahmed, Josh Siegel |   This paper introduces the Pareto Data Framework, an approach for identifying\\nand selecting the Minimum Viable Data (MVD) required for enabling machine\\nlearning applications on constrained platforms such as embedded systems, mobile\\ndevices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We demonstrate that strategic\\ndata reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing\\nbandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies\\nMinimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource-constrained\\nenvironments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient\\npractices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and\\noverprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for\\noptimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data\\nrepresentation. An experimental methodology demonstrates effective acoustic\\ndata characterization after downsampling, quantization, and truncation to\\nsimulate reduced-fidelity sensors and network and storage constraints; results\\nshows that performance can be maintained up to 95\\\\% with sample rates reduced\\nby 75\\\\% and bit depths and clip length reduced by 50\\\\% which translates into\\nsubstantial cost and resource reduction. These findings have implications on\\nthe design and development of constrained systems.

Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a\\npowerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,\\ncomplex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in\\nperformance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and\\nits innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer\\nknowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact\\nand efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application\\nacross various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and\\nhistorical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are\\nhighlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational\\nefficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical\\ndeployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of\\nKD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the\\nbreadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case\\nstudies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,\\nsuch as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review\\ndiscusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical\\nconstraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive\\noverview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS. Through this\\norganization, the paper not only elucidates the current state of research in KD\\nbut also sets the stage for future research opportunities, thereby contributing\\nsignificantly to both academic research and real-world applications.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12111v1) |\\n| It depends: Varieties of defining growth dependence | Anja Janischewski, Katharina Bohnenberger, Matthias Kranke, Tobias Vogel, Riwan Driouich, Tobias Froese, Stefanie Gerold, Raphael Kaufmann, Lorenz Key\\u00dfer, Jannis Niethammer, Christopher Olk, Matthias Schmelzer, Asl\\u0131 Y\\u00fcr\\u00fck, Steffen Lange |   Many socio-economic systems require positive economic growth rates to\\nfunction properly. Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing\\nevidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,\\nthese growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,\\nmore and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth-dependent systems\\nand develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of\\n'growth dependence' still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,\\nwhich impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article\\nproposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the\\nconcept of 'growth dependence' across socio-economic systems. We provide a\\ngeneral definition consisting of four components that can be specified for\\ndifferent empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of\\nmeasurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions\\nor properties of the system under investigation. According to our general\\ndefinition, a socio-economic system is growth-dependent if it requires a\\nlong-term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to\\nmaintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen\\nnormative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to\\nthree areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:\\nemployment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies\\ndemonstrate that whether or not a system is growth-dependent hinges not only on\\nthe empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of\\nthe concept of growth dependence.

Computer-assisted Surgery systems\\nhave played a crucial role in improving the precision and safety of ESD\\nprocedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognition\\nof surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesion\\ncharacteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real-time\\nsurgical phase recognition algorithms. Existing surgical phase recognition\\nalgorithms struggle to efficiently capture temporal contexts in video-based\\nscenarios, leading to insufficient performance. To address these issues, we\\npropose SPRMamba, a novel Mamba-based framework for ESD surgical phase\\nrecognition. SPRMamba leverages the strengths of Mamba for long-term temporal\\nmodeling while introducing the Scaled Residual TranMamba block to enhance the\\ncapture of fine-grained details, overcoming the limitations of traditional\\ntemporal models like Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformers.\\nMoreover, a Temporal Sample Strategy is introduced to accelerate the\\nprocessing, which is essential for real-time phase recognition in clinical\\nsettings.

However, datasets distributed across each\\nclient in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can\\nbe globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly\\naffects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated\\nlearning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it\\nfails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data.\\nThis results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting\\nthe equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a\\nmethodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,\\nwe propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the\\nlocal training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred\\noptimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state-of-the-art\\nmethods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed\\ndistribution.

Recently, this\\ncuriosity has motivated the fMRI-to-image reconstruction task; given the fMRI\\ndata from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual\\nstimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent\\nDiffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex\\nvisual stimuli such as high-resolution natural images from vision datasets.\\nDespite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often\\nlack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.\\nConsequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere\\nvisuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs\\neffectively incorporate multi-modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,\\nand image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image\\ngenerations. Specifically, inspired by the two-streams hypothesis suggesting\\nthat perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain\\nregions, our framework, Brain-Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain\\nregions to appropriate embeddings.

Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric\\ninformation (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g.,\\ncolor, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially\\nwhen foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance.\\nWe employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition.\\nExisting methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy\\nbased on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, such\\nrepresentations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse\\nacquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\\napproach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which\\nintegrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance\\nthe robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach\\ncaptures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular,\\nliquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and\\nintroduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and\\nassess bowl fullness.

Agyeman, Jinfeng Liu, Sirish L. Shah |   Efficient water management in agriculture is important for mitigating the\\ngrowing freshwater scarcity crisis. Mixed-integer Model Predictive Control\\n(MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex\\nscheduling problems in agricultural irrigation. However, the computational\\ncomplexity of mixed-integer MPC still poses a significant challenge,\\nparticularly in large-scale applications. This study proposes an approach to\\nenhance the computational efficiency of mixed-integer MPC-based irrigation\\nschedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture\\ndynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed-integer linear\\nrepresentation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the\\nmixed-integer MPC-based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a\\nmixed-integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed-integer\\nnonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global\\noptimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated\\nthrough comparative studies conducted on a large-scale agricultural field\\nacross two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models,\\nspecifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used\\ntriggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU-based approach significantly\\nreduces solution times -- by up to 99.5\\\\% -- while achieving comparable\\nperformance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water\\nUse Efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, the ReLU-based approach maintains enhanced\\nperformance in terms of total prescribed irrigation and IWUE compared to the\\nwidely-used triggered irrigation scheduling method.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12082v1) |\\n| Design of Ligand-Binding Proteins with Atomic Flow Matching | Junqi Liu, Shaoning Li, Chence Shi, Zhi Yang, Jian Tang |   Designing novel proteins that bind to small molecules is a long-standing\\nchallenge in computational biology, with applications in developing catalysts,\\nbiosensors, and more. Current computational methods rely on the assumption that\\nthe binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible,\\nas conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon\\nbinding.

Valence-space nuclear\\nshell-model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit\\nregisters using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$-shell and 24\\nqubits for the $sd$-shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement\\n($n$-tangles) and magic (non-stabilizerness) are determined.

To address these\\nconcerns, recent research has focused on developing zero-knowledge machine\\nlearning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of\\nML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have\\nsubstantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily\\noptimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the\\nsubstantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the\\nmodel and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new\\nCommit-and-Prove SNARK (CP-SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that\\neffectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML\\npipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white-box use of the\\nunderlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic\\npolynomial commitment and only makes black-box use of the proof system. As a\\nresult, Artemis is compatible with state-of-the-art proof systems without\\ntrusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP-SNARKs, evaluate\\ntheir performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial\\nimprovements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover\\ncosts and maintaining efficiency even for large-scale models. For example, for\\nthe VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from\\n11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML\\ntowards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and\\ncomplex ML models.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12055v1) |\\n| MMP for Enriques pairs and singular Enriques varieties | Francesco Antonio Denisi, \\u00c1ngel David R\\u00edos Ortiz, Nikolaos Tsakanikas, Zhixin Xie |   We introduce and study the class of primitive Enriques varieties, whose\\nsmooth members are Enriques manifolds.

It also includes the full spin-orbital rotation group. Moreover, to\\nimprove the code's flexibility for impurities with complex interactions, this\\nnew version allows to choose between a standard Anderson Hamiltonian for the\\nimpurity or, as another novel feature, an ionic model that requires only the\\nspectrum and the impurity Lehmann amplitudes.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12050v1) |\\n| Quantum-like nonlinear interferometry with frequency-engineered\\n  classical light | Romain Dalidet, Anthony Martin, Gr\\u00e9gory Sauder, Laurent Labont\\u00e9, S\\u00e9bastien Tanzilli |   Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic\\nentanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits.

While most approaches in the Safe\\nReinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and\\nrobot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them\\nin complex real-world settings. Instead, model-based approaches that\\nincorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning\\nframework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on\\nthe real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot\\ndynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task-specific and hard\\nto obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to\\ncompute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long-term safety\\nrequirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe\\nexploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus\\non ensuring long-term safety and handling of uncertainty.

To\\ncorroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five\\ninteracting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning.

However, current methods often require hundreds to\\nthousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual\\nobservations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual\\nrepresentations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or\\ntrained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present\\nDynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual\\nrepresentations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a\\nlatent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of\\nimage embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without\\naugmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.\\nImportantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet\\ndatasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real\\nenvironments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly\\nimprove downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised\\nlearning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo\\nhold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,\\nand nearest neighbors.

While the y-distortion can be\\ndetected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the\\n$\\\\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\\\\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude\\nsmaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a\\nserious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\\\\mu$\\narises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the\\nprimordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \\\\approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here,\\nwe present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly\\ndetecting $\\\\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but\\nwith an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we\\noptimize the instrument's configuration to target $\\\\mu$ while robustly\\nmarginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike\\nFourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their\\nindividual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing\\nsignificant flexibility.

We implement a\\ncontrolled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation,\\nutilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several\\ninsights into long-context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of\\nperplexity as a general-purpose performance indicator even in longer-context\\ntasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods\\nsystematically underperform across long-context tasks. Finally, we confirm that\\nexact fine-tuning based methods are generally effective within the range of\\ntheir extension, whereas extrapolation remains challenging. All codebases,\\nmodels, and checkpoints will be made available open-source, promoting\\ntransparency and facilitating further research in this critical area of AI\\ndevelopment.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12181v1) |\\n| Finetuning Language Models to Emit Linguistic Expressions of Uncertainty | Arslan Chaudhry, Sridhar Thiagarajan, Dilan Gorur |   Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in information-seeking\\nand decision-making tasks. Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate\\ninformation that conflicts with real-world facts, and their persuasive style\\ncan make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result,\\nend-users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with\\nthe accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all\\noutputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore\\nsupervised finetuning on uncertainty-augmented predictions as a method to\\ndevelop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty.\\nSpecifically, we measure the calibration of pre-trained models and then\\nfine-tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of\\nuncertainty. Through experiments on various question-answering datasets, we\\ndemonstrate that LLMs are well-calibrated in assessing their predictions, and\\nsupervised finetuning based on the model's own confidence leads to\\nwell-calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single-claim\\nanswers.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12180v1) |\\n| Computational Dynamical Systems | Jordan Cotler, Semon Rezchikov |   We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite-dimensional\\ndynamical systems. Building off of previous work, we give definitions for what\\nit means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine.

Subsequently, we\\nshow that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable\\none-dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and\\nmoreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt.\\nMore broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one 'machine' to simulate\\nanother, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low-complexity 'encoders' and\\n'decoders' to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system\\nbeing simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical\\nsystem leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity\\ntheory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12179v1) |\\n| Poisson approximate likelihood compared to the particle filter | Yize Hao, Aaron A. Abkemeier, Edward L. Ionides |   Filtering algorithms are fundamental for inference on partially observed\\nstochastic dynamic systems, since they provide access to the likelihood\\nfunction and hence enable likelihood-based or Bayesian inference. A novel\\nPoisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.\\n(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering\\na fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of\\npartially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL\\nis the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large\\nimprovement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,\\nbased on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.\\n(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should\\nuse PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence\\nalso reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a\\nshortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that\\nthe comparison of log-likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al. (2023) is\\nflawed because their PAL calculations were carried out using a dataset scaled\\ndifferently from the previous study. If PAL and the particle filter are applied\\nto the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears. On simulations\\nwhere the model is correctly specified, the particle filter outperforms PAL.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12173v1) |\\n| You Only Read Once (YORO): Learning to Internalize Database Knowledge\\n  for Text-to-SQL | Hideo Kobayashi, Wuwei Lan, Peng Shi, Shuaichen Chang, Jiang Guo, Henghui Zhu, Zhiguo Wang, Patrick Ng |   While significant progress has been made on the text-to-SQL task, recent\\nsolutions repeatedly encode the same database schema for every question,\\nresulting in unnecessary high inference cost and often overlooking crucial\\ndatabase knowledge.

However,\\ndue to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across\\ndifferent MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In\\nthis study, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework, multiPI-TransBTS,\\nwhich integrates multi-physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.\\nThe model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi-modal\\nimaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor\\ncharacteristics. The multiPI-TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an\\nAdaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi-source, multi-scale feature\\ndecoder. The encoder incorporates a multi-branch architecture to separately\\nextract modality-specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module\\nfuses information from multiple sources using channel-wise and element-wise\\nattention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both\\ncommon and task-specific features through a Task-Specific Feature Introduction\\n(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),\\nTumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on\\nthe BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of\\nmultiPI-TransBTS over the state-of-the-art methods. The model consistently\\nachieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,\\nhighlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results\\nalso indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision\\nand recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a\\nsignificant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving\\nclinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12167v1) |\\n| Synchrotron self-Compton in a radiative-adiabatic fireball scenario:\\n  Modelling the multiwavelength observations in some Fermi/LAT bursts | Nissim Fraija, P.

Becerra |   Energetic GeV photons expected from the closest and the most energetic\\nGamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provide an unique opportunity to study the\\nvery-high-energy emission as well as the possible correlations with lower\\nenergy bands in realistic GRB afterglow models. In the standard GRB afterglow\\nmodel, the relativistic homogeneous shock is usually considered to be fully\\nadiabatic, however, it could be partially radiative. Based on the external\\nforward-shock scenario in both stellar wind and constant-density medium. We\\npresent a radiative-adiabatic analytical model of the synchrotron self-Compton\\n(SSC) and synchrotron processes considering an electron energy distribution\\nwith a power-law index of 1 < p < 2 and 2 $\\\\leq$ p.

Under the\\nBernoulli-Gaussian model for the inputs, we derive sufficient exact recovery\\nconditions in the noise-free setting. A stable recovery result is then\\nestablished, ensuring the estimation error remains manageable even when the\\nobservations are corrupted by a small amount of noise. Numerical tests with\\nsynthetic and real-world network data illustrate the merits of the proposed\\nalgorithm, its robustness to noise as well as the benefits of leveraging\\nmultiple signals to aid the (blind) localization of sources of diffusion.

Most of the wheelchair users\\nneed help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs\\nare not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this\\nproject, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair\\nusers. A robot with a WeHelp system has three modes, following mode, remote\\ncontrol mode and tele-operation mode. In the following mode, the robot follows\\nthe wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can\\nask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the\\nwheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech\\nrecognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode.\\nIn the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy\\nstick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs,\\nsuch as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high\\nshelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant\\ntakes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks\\nfor their needs.

These IFSs\\nexhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are\\ntopologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the\\nBlonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave\\nsuperconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients\\nincluding thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and\\nexamine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage\\nand temperature bias.

However, a\\nrobot's ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if\\nnaively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach-avoid\\ndynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a\\nsafety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human's behavior\\nas goal-driven but conditioned on the robot's plan, enabling us to capture\\ninfluence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical\\nand belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in\\nhuman behavior will evolve over time.

This paper\\npresents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large\\nlanguage models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their \\\"black box\\\" and static\\nnature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item\\nvisual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a\\nMultimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style\\nand color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis\\nfor personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the\\nopen-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability\\nto recommend stylish outfits.

While these improve performance, they often reach a\\nsaturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated\\nfeedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key\\nchallenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can\\nover-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and\\naddress errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to\\nidentify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding\\nhow many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too\\nsoon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose\\nMAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty\\nas easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard\\nones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error\\nlocalization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores.\\nMoreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with\\nthree agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on\\nstep-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure\\nsufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating\\nfurther rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5\\nand show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of\\nMAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by\\n4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with\\nbaselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations.

In this\\nreport, we introduce Takin AudioLLM, a series of techniques and models, mainly\\nincluding Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, specifically designed for\\naudiobook production. These models are capable of zero-shot speech production,\\ngenerating high-quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human\\nspeech and facilitating individuals to customize the speech content according\\nto their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec\\nlanguage model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a\\nmulti-task training framework, capable of generating high-fidelity natural\\nspeech in a zero-shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and\\ntimbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while\\nadvocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its\\nnaturalness and expressiveness. Last, we propose the Takin Morphing system with\\nhighly decoupled and advanced timbre and prosody modeling approaches, which\\nenables individuals to customize speech production with their preferred timbre\\nand prosody in a precise and controllable manner. Extensive experiments\\nvalidate the effectiveness and robustness of our Takin AudioLLM series models.\\nFor detailed demos, please refer to https://takinaudiollm.github.io.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12139v1) |\\n| GRIN: GRadient-INformed MoE | Liyuan Liu, Young Jin Kim, Shuohang Wang, Chen Liang, Yelong Shen, Hao Cheng, Xiaodong Liu, Masahiro Tanaka, Xiaoxia Wu, Wenxiang Hu, Vishrav Chaudhary, Zeqi Lin, Chenruidong Zhang, Jilong Xue, Hany Awadalla, Jianfeng Gao, Weizhu Chen |   Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale more effectively than dense models due\\nto sparse computation through expert routing, selectively activating only a\\nsmall subset of expert modules. However, sparse computation challenges\\ntraditional training practices, as discrete expert routing hinders standard\\nbackpropagation and thus gradient-based optimization, which are the cornerstone\\nof deep learning. To better pursue the scaling power of MoE, we introduce GRIN\\n(GRadient-INformed MoE training), which incorporates sparse gradient estimation\\nfor expert routing and configures model parallelism to avoid token dropping.\\nApplying GRIN to autoregressive language modeling, we develop a top-2\\n16$\\\\times$3.8B MoE model.

However, each approach has its own limitations,\\nmaking it less effective to rely solely on either one. An emerging and\\npromising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractive\\nsummarization methods. Despite the plethora of studies in this domain, research\\non the combined methodology remains scarce, particularly in the context of\\nVietnamese language processing. This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDS\\nframework leveraging a two-component pipeline architecture that integrates\\nextractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs an\\nextractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This is\\nachieved by a modification of the pre-trained BERT network, which derives\\nsemantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet network\\nstructures. The second component utilizes the VBD-LLaMA2-7B-50b model for\\nabstractive summarization, ultimately generating the final summary document.\\nOur proposed framework demonstrates a positive performance, attaining ROUGE-2\\nscores of 39.6% on the VN-MDS dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art\\nbaselines.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12134v1) |\\n| Einstein-dilaton-four-Maxwell Holographic Anisotropic Models | Irina Ya. Aref'eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov |   In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the\\nfive-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell models has played a crucial role.\\nTypically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while\\nadditional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A\\nmore general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field\\nrepresents spatial longitudinal-transverse anisotropy, while the third and\\nfourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We\\nconsider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero\\ntemperature and five functions at non-zero temperature. Maxwell field related\\nto the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,\\nwhereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.\\nWe demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of\\nthe seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations -- either the\\ndilaton or the vector potential equation -- follows from the Einstein equations\\nand the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi\\nidentity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress-energy\\ntensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is\\nprovided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to\\nthree Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis\\nshows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein\\nequations and the equation for the vector potential\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12131v1) |\\n| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components\\n  for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco-Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram |   Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data\\ntogether with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal\\ncomponents used. It is therefore important to determine the number of\\nsignificant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a\\nvariational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for\\nestimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of\\nsamples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This\\neliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of\\nprincipal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.\\nThis framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows\\nand columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),\\nand with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data\\nwith arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as\\ncultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our\\nmethod on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may\\nunderestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the\\nsynthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical\\ndataset. These results suggest that it is broadly applicable across the life\\nsciences.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12129v1) |\\n| Linguini: A benchmark for language-agnostic linguistic reasoning | Eduardo S\\u00e1nchez, Belen Alastruey, Christophe Ropers, Pontus Stenetorp, Mikel Artetxe, Marta R.

The test\\ncovers 894 questions grouped in 160 problems across 75 (mostly) extremely\\nlow-resource languages, extracted from the International Linguistic Olympiad\\ncorpus. To attain high accuracy on this benchmark, models don't need previous\\nknowledge of the tested language, as all the information needed to solve the\\nlinguistic puzzle is presented in the context. We find that, while all analyzed\\nmodels rank below 25% accuracy, there is a significant gap between open and\\nclosed models, with the best-performing proprietary model at 24.05% and the\\nbest-performing open model at 8.84%.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12126v1) |\\n| From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the\\n  primordial black hole reheating scenario | Guillem Dom\\u00e8nech, Jan Tr\\u00e4nkle |   We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs\\noriginate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight\\nPBHs with masses $M\\\\lesssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat\\nit via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate\\nwhether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH\\nreheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the\\ninitial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer\\nfunctions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and\\nisocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation\\nof state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH\\ndominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the\\nspectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive\\nto $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density\\nfluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance\\nas a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\\nobservations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the\\ninitial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we\\nfind that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several\\nfuture GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas,\\nespecially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any\\nearly matter-dominated universe scenario.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12125v1) |\\n| Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules | Anqi Zhang, Wilson S. Geisler |   Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We\\ninvestigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented\\ndisplays having well-separated potential target-object locations. Performance\\nwas compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption\\nthat the information from the different potential target locations is\\nstatistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than\\noptimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the\\nimplausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show\\nthat three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical\\nresults. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near\\noptimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the\\ncentral potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise\\ncauses search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These\\nfindings have far-reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks\\nand other identification tasks in humans and other animals.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12124v1) |\\n| Far-from-equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann\\n  approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows\\n  $v_n$ | Vincenzo Nugara, Vincenzo Greco, Salvatore Plumari |   We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal\\nsystem in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution\\nfunction and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system\\nsizes $R$ and interaction strength $\\\\eta/s$ and identify universality classes\\nbased upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each\\nof this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $\\\\hat\\n\\\\gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results\\nhighlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum\\nmoments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to\\na 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of\\ndifferent sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a\\nsimilar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse\\nflow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system\\nsize and $\\\\eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and\\ntheir response functions, along with the impact of the $\\\\eta/s$ and the system\\ntransverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in\\nmomentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow\\n$v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of\\nlarge opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems\\nevolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play\\nin this process.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12123v1) |\\n| Qwen2.5-Math Technical Report: Toward Mathematical Expert Model via\\n  Self-Improvement | An Yang, Beichen Zhang, Binyuan Hui, Bofei Gao, Bowen Yu, Chengpeng Li, Dayiheng Liu, Jianhong Tu, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin, Keming Lu, Mingfeng Xue, Runji Lin, Tianyu Liu, Xingzhang Ren, Zhenru Zhang |   In this report, we present a series of math-specific large language models:\\nQwen2.5-Math and Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct-1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the\\nQwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self-improvement\\nthroughout the entire pipeline, from pre-training and post-training to\\ninference: (1) During the pre-training phase, Qwen2-Math-Instruct is utilized\\nto generate large-scale, high-quality mathematical data. (2) In the\\npost-training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive\\nsampling from Qwen2-Math-Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative\\nevolution of data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model,\\nit's possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the\\nnext round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the\\nultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct.\\n(3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling,\\noptimizing the model's performance.\\n  Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced\\nmathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and\\nTool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics\\ndatasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and\\nAIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math\\ncompetition problems.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12122v1) |\\n| Computing the $\\\\mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two-Dimensional\\n  Strongly-Correlated Systems | Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn |   We show that the two-dimensional $\\\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time-reversal\\ninvariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary-condition\\ndependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non-interacting and\\nstrongly-correlated insulators.

Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a\\nmoment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching\\nalgorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The\\nmeasurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight\\nto obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim\\nsimulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find\\nthe mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We\\nalso find the E-Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic\\nstructures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical\\nand X-Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to\\nmap large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of\\nthe cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the\\npeaks are similar to X-Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster\\nand show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12119v1) |\\n| Low Frame-rate Speech Codec: a Codec Designed for Fast High-quality\\n  Speech LLM Training and Inference | Edresson Casanova, Ryan Langman, Paarth Neekhara, Shehzeen Hussain, Jason Li, Subhankar Ghosh, Ante Juki\\u0107, Sang-gil Lee |   Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing\\nthrough audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the\\napplication of language modeling techniques to audio data.

Johnson |   Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide\\nstringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post-BBN (Big\\nBang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models\\nwith COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.\\nHere, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark\\nphoton conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous\\nworks only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the\\nchange to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon\\ndistortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the\\ndistortion has an opposite sign and a $\\\\simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We\\nfurthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover\\nthe redshift range $\\\\simeq 2\\\\times 10^6-4\\\\times 10^7$ between the $\\\\mu$-era and\\nthe end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints\\nfor dark photon masses in the range $10^{-4}\\\\,{\\\\rm eV}\\\\lesssim m_{\\\\rm\\ndp}\\\\lesssim 10^{-3}\\\\,{\\\\rm eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We\\ndemonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon\\nto dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $\\\\mu$-type distortion\\nindependent of the conversion redshift.

Robot teams traversing hazardous environments -- with e.g.\\nrough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or\\ncapturing robots -- should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of\\nrisks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should\\ntake the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the\\nteam-level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward\\nfrom visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider\\nbi-objective trail-planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a\\nhazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed\\ngraph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of\\nsurvival.

Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a\\npowerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,\\ncomplex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in\\nperformance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and\\nits innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer\\nknowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact\\nand efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application\\nacross various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and\\nhistorical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are\\nhighlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational\\nefficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical\\ndeployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of\\nKD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the\\nbreadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case\\nstudies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,\\nsuch as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review\\ndiscusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical\\nconstraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive\\noverview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS.

Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing\\nevidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,\\nthese growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,\\nmore and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth-dependent systems\\nand develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of\\n'growth dependence' still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,\\nwhich impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article\\nproposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the\\nconcept of 'growth dependence' across socio-economic systems. We provide a\\ngeneral definition consisting of four components that can be specified for\\ndifferent empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of\\nmeasurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions\\nor properties of the system under investigation. According to our general\\ndefinition, a socio-economic system is growth-dependent if it requires a\\nlong-term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to\\nmaintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen\\nnormative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to\\nthree areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:\\nemployment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies\\ndemonstrate that whether or not a system is growth-dependent hinges not only on\\nthe empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of\\nthe concept of growth dependence.

Recent advances in AI have sparked renewed interest in this area, with\\nlarge language models (LLMs) emerging as both tools and subjects of value\\nmeasurement. This work introduces Generative Psychometrics for Values (GPV), an\\nLLM-based, data-driven value measurement paradigm, theoretically grounded in\\ntext-revealed selective perceptions. We begin by fine-tuning an LLM for\\naccurate perception-level value measurement and verifying the capability of\\nLLMs to parse texts into perceptions, forming the core of the GPV pipeline.\\nApplying GPV to human-authored blogs, we demonstrate its stability, validity,\\nand superiority over prior psychological tools. Then, extending GPV to LLM\\nvalue measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometric\\nmethodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free-form\\noutputs, enabling context-specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis of\\nmeasurement paradigms, indicating response biases of prior methods; and 3) an\\nattempt to bridge LLM values and their safety, revealing the predictive power\\nof different value systems and the impacts of various values on LLM safety.\\nThrough interdisciplinary efforts, we aim to leverage AI for next-generation\\npsychometrics and psychometrics for value-aligned AI.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12106v1) |\\n| FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated\\n  Long-Tailed Learning | Xiuhua Lu, Peng Li, Xuefeng Jiang |   Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy\\nin distributed machine learning. However, datasets distributed across each\\nclient in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can\\nbe globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly\\naffects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated\\nlearning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it\\nfails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data.\\nThis results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting\\nthe equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a\\nmethodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,\\nwe propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the\\nlocal training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred\\noptimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state-of-the-art\\nmethods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed\\ndistribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10-LT and\\nCIFAR-100-LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of\\nmodel performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long-tailed\\ndistribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12105v1) |\\n| Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error\\n  Detection | Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia |   Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications. Doing\\nso requires overcoming the noise present on today's hardware. The quantum\\napproximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling\\nup due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup\\nover state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems. However,\\nachieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require\\nfault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant\\nimplementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection\\ncode. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the\\nalgorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with\\nup to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we\\npropose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance, and use it\\nto characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance\\nto future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our\\nmodel can be used to determine necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform\\nGoemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware.

Recently, this\\ncuriosity has motivated the fMRI-to-image reconstruction task; given the fMRI\\ndata from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual\\nstimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent\\nDiffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex\\nvisual stimuli such as high-resolution natural images from vision datasets.\\nDespite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often\\nlack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.\\nConsequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere\\nvisuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs\\neffectively incorporate multi-modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,\\nand image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image\\ngenerations. Specifically, inspired by the two-streams hypothesis suggesting\\nthat perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain\\nregions, our framework, Brain-Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain\\nregions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from\\nsemantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information\\nregions, Brain-Streams provides accurate multi-modal guidance to LDMs. We\\nvalidate the reconstruction ability of Brain-Streams both quantitatively and\\nqualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI\\ndata.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12099v1) |\\n| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal\\n  execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huy\\u00ean Pham |   Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and\\nconstraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity\\nmarkets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general\\npropagator model under linear functional inequality constraints.

The task of\\nnext-best-view (NBV) planning is to infer the pose of the next viewpoint based\\non the current data, and gradually realize the complete three-dimensional\\nreconstruction.

It can select the next best view at an\\nextremely fast speed while ensuring the complete scanning of the object.\\nSpecifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into\\nellipsoids based on the voxel structure.Then, the next best view is selected\\nfrom the candidate views using a projection-based viewpoint quality evaluation\\nfunction in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy. This process\\nreplaces the ray-casting in voxel structures, significantly improving the\\ncomputational efficiency. Comparative experiments with other algorithms in a\\nsimulation environment show that the framework proposed in this paper can\\nachieve 10 times efficiency improvement on the basis of capturing roughly the\\nsame coverage.

We\\ninvestigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless\\noscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely\\nfollow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations\\nare standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations\\nwhere the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase\\nare randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal\\nby considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of\\ntelescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast\\nFourier transform.

As a method\\nfor UDA, we show that AdaPrune outperforms related techniques, and is\\ncomplementary to other UDA algorithms such as CORAL. Our analysis of the\\nrelationship between the MMD and model accuracy, along with t-SNE plots,\\nvalidate the proposed method as a principled and well-founded way of performing\\ndata pruning.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12076v1) |\\n| The elastica sling | Alessandro Cazzolli, Francesco Dal Corso |   The nonlinear mechanics of a flexible elastic rod constrained at its edges by\\na pair of sliding sleeves is analyzed. The planar equilibrium configurations of\\nthis variable-length elastica are found to have shape defined only by the\\ninclination of the two constraints, while their distance is responsible only\\nfor scaling the size. By extending the theoretical stability criterion\\navailable for systems under isoperimetric constraints to the case of variable\\ndomains, the existence of no more than one stable equilibrium solution is\\nrevealed. The set of sliding sleeves' inclination pairs for which the stability\\nis lost are identified. Such critical conditions allow the indefinite ejection\\nof the flexible rod from the sliding sleeves, thus realizing an elastica sling.\\nFinally, the theoretical findings are validated by experiments on a physical\\nprototype. The present results lead to a novel actuation principle that may\\nfind application as a mechanism in energy harvesting, wave mitigation devices,\\nand soft robotic locomotion.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12075v1) |\\n| Online Refractive Camera Model Calibration in Visual Inertial Odometry | Mohit Singh, Kostas Alexis |   This paper presents a general refractive camera model and online\\nco-estimation of odometry and the refractive index of unknown media.

The refractive index is estimated online as a state\\nvariable of a monocular visual-inertial odometry framework in an iterative\\nformulation using the proposed camera model.

The evaluations\\ndemonstrate convergence to the ideal refractive index for water despite\\nsignificant perturbations in the initialization. Simultaneously, the approach\\nenables on-par visual-inertial odometry performance in refractive media without\\nprior knowledge of the refractive index or requirement of medium-specific\\ncamera calibration.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12074v1) |\\n| Influence of dislocations in multilayer graphene stacks: A phase field\\n  crystal study | K. R. Elder, Zhi-Feng Huang, T. Ala-Nissila |   In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene\\nstacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a\\nrecently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems\\nincorporating out-of-plane deformations and parameterized to match to density\\nfunctional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems. The\\nspecific configuration considered consists of one monolayer containing four\\n$5|7$ dislocations (i.e., two dislocation dipoles) sandwiched in between\\nperfect graphene layers. The study reveals how the strain field from the\\ndislocations in the defected layer leads to out-of-plane deformations that in\\nturn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are\\nmade for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a\\ndefect-free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and\\nsystem size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by\\nroughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence\\nacross the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height\\nprofiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12073v1) |\\n| PAD-FT: A Lightweight Defense for Backdoor Attacks via Data Purification\\n  and Fine-Tuning | Yukai Xu, Yujie Gu, Kouichi Sakurai |   Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks,\\nparticularly as recent advancements have led to increasingly subtle\\nimplantation, making the defense more challenging. Existing defense mechanisms\\ntypically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and\\ninvolve retraining an auxiliary model or fine-tuning the entire victim model.\\nHowever, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always\\nfeasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and\\nlightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD-FT, that does not require an\\nadditional clean dataset and fine-tunes only a very small part of the model to\\ndisinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a\\nsimple data purification process to identify and select the most-likely clean\\ndata from the poisoned training dataset. The self-purified clean dataset is\\nthen used for activation clipping and fine-tuning only the last classification\\nlayer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation\\nclipping, and classifier fine-tuning, our mechanism PAD-FT demonstrates\\nsuperior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as\\nconfirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12072v1) |\\n| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing\\n  data in Irish sagas | P. MacCarron |   For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts\\nin order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify\\nsimilarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the\\nsignificance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture\\nrequires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and\\noften impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the\\nnetwork of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that\\nthe top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent\\nwith central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has\\nbeen lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust\\nto a large random removal of edges.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12071v1) |\\n| The repetition threshold for ternary rich words | James D. Currie, Lucas Mol, Jarkko Peltom\\u00e4ki |   In 2014, Vesti proposed the problem of determining the repetition threshold\\nfor infinite rich words, i.e., for infinite words in which all factors of\\nlength $n$ contain $n$ distinct nonempty palindromic factors.

Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by\\ntidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to\\ntheir proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the\\nTRAPPIST-1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In\\nthis work, we present the recent implementation of the co-planar tidal torque\\nand forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N-body code\\nPosidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using\\na tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of\\neach planet by taking into account their multi-layer internal structure\\ncomputed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets\\nare not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state.\\nPlanet-planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and\\ntides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a\\nresult, the sub-stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and\\nlong-timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with\\nperiods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12065v1) |\\n| Quantum Magic and Multi-Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei | Florian Br\\u00f6kemeier, S. Momme Hengstenberg, James W. T. Keeble, Caroline E. P. Robin, Federico Rocco, Martin J. Savage |   Motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the\\nquantum complexity of $p$-shell and $sd$-shell nuclei. Valence-space nuclear\\nshell-model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit\\nregisters using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$-shell and 24\\nqubits for the $sd$-shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement\\n($n$-tangles) and magic (non-stabilizerness) are determined. While exact\\nevaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of\\nactive nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex\\nnuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique\\nis introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed\\nnuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\\\\sim 8$ for some\\nnuclei. Significant multi-nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$-shell,\\ndominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of\\nmagic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on\\nthe path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion.\\nThese results indicate that quantum-computing resources will accelerate\\nprecision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12064v1) |\\n| Post-Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a\\n  massive, rotating object | Lorenzo Iorio |   The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the\\ngeneral relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring\\ncomponents of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are\\nanalytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level. To the Newtonian\\norder, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as\\nwell. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation\\nin space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the\\nprimary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first\\nto 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system\\nalong an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred\\nclose to the Sun's flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due\\nto the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of\\nmicroarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for\\nthe post-Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)\\nspacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of\\nthe latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current\\n(formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would\\nbring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the\\npredicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not\\nchanged by any of the post--Keplerian accelerations considered. The\\ncalculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any\\nalternative models of gravity as well.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12063v1) |\\n| Generalized Robot Learning Framework | Jiahuan Yan, Zhouyang Hong, Yu Zhao, Yu Tian, Yunxin Liu, Travis Davies, Luhui Hu |   Imitation based robot learning has recently gained significant attention in\\nthe robotics field due to its theoretical potential for transferability and\\ngeneralizability. However, it remains notoriously costly, both in terms of\\nhardware and data collection, and deploying it in real-world environments\\ndemands meticulous setup of robots and precise experimental conditions. In this\\npaper, we present a low-cost robot learning framework that is both easily\\nreproducible and transferable to various robots and environments. We\\ndemonstrate that deployable imitation learning can be successfully applied even\\nto industrial-grade robots, not just expensive collaborative robotic arms.\\nFurthermore, our results show that multi-task robot learning is achievable with\\nsimple network architectures and fewer demonstrations than previously thought\\nnecessary. As the current evaluating method is almost subjective when it comes\\nto real-world manipulation tasks, we propose Voting Positive Rate (VPR) - a\\nnovel evaluation strategy that provides a more objective assessment of\\nperformance. We conduct an extensive comparison of success rates across various\\nself-designed tasks to validate our approach.

To address these\\nconcerns, recent research has focused on developing zero-knowledge machine\\nlearning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of\\nML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have\\nsubstantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily\\noptimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the\\nsubstantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the\\nmodel and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new\\nCommit-and-Prove SNARK (CP-SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that\\neffectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML\\npipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white-box use of the\\nunderlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic\\npolynomial commitment and only makes black-box use of the proof system. As a\\nresult, Artemis is compatible with state-of-the-art proof systems without\\ntrusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP-SNARKs, evaluate\\ntheir performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial\\nimprovements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover\\ncosts and maintaining efficiency even for large-scale models. For example, for\\nthe VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from\\n11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML\\ntowards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and\\ncomplex ML models.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12055v1) |\\n| MMP for Enriques pairs and singular Enriques varieties | Francesco Antonio Denisi, \\u00c1ngel David R\\u00edos Ortiz, Nikolaos Tsakanikas, Zhixin Xie |   We introduce and study the class of primitive Enriques varieties, whose\\nsmooth members are Enriques manifolds.

While most approaches in the Safe\\nReinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and\\nrobot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them\\nin complex real-world settings.

However, there are a few areas where improvements can be made to enhance the effectiveness and verifiability of the output:\n\n1. **Source URL Inclusion:**\n   - It is essential to include verifiable information such as the source URL for each paper in the markdown table. This will allow users to easily access the original papers for further reading and verification. Consider adding a column for the URL in the markdown table.\n\n2. **Keyword Specification:**\n   - The plan mentions using \"relevant keywords\" for searching papers. It would be beneficial to specify which keywords will be used to ensure a focused search. For example, keywords like \"Large Language Models,\" \"GPT,\" \"transformers,\" etc., could be included.\n\n3. **Domain Categorization:**\n   - While the plan mentions categorizing papers by domain, it would be helpful to define the specific domains that will be included in the table. This will provide clarity and ensure consistency in categorization.\n\n4. **Data Extraction Details:**\n   - The plan could benefit from specifying how the scientist will determine the domain of application for each paper. Will this be based on the abstract, keywords, or another method? Providing clarity on this process will enhance the reliability of the categorization.\n\n5. **Review Process:**\n   - The review process is a good step, but it might be useful to include a checklist of criteria for the scientist to use when reviewing the markdown table. This could include checking for completeness, accuracy of information, and proper formatting.\n\n6. **Timeline:**\n   - Consider adding a timeline for each step of the process.

However, current methods often require hundreds to\nthousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual\nobservations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual\nrepresentations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or\ntrained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present\nDynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual\nrepresentations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a\nlatent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of\nimage embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without\naugmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.\nImportantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet\ndatasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real\nenvironments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly\nimprove downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised\nlearning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo\nhold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,\nand nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and\nmeasure its impact on downstream policy performance.

Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,\nwhich enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions\ninto different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to\ngenerate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning\nwith human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary\nPosition Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional\ninformation across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for\nprocessing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception\ncapabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL\ninvestigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By\nscaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the\namount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive\nperformance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to\nleading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal\nbenchmarks, outperforming other generalist models.

BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses\nand 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance\nof deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to\nintegrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and\nperformance. However, widely-used C++-based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,\ng$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries\nlike PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of\ndebugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we\nintroduce an eager-mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,\nproviding PyTorch-compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach\nincludes GPU-accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for\n2nd-order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear\nsolvers. Our eager-mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency,\nachieving an average speedup of 18.5$\\times$, 22$\\times$, and 23$\\times$\ncompared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12190v1) |\n| Massively Multi-Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context | Felix B Mueller, Julian Tanke, Juergen Gall |   Forecasting long-term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of\nhuman behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input\nsequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby\npeople can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene-aware social\ntransformer model (SAST) to forecast long-term (10s) human motion motion.\nUnlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely\nvarying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal\nconvolutional encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer-based bottleneck\nthat allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model\nthe conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We\nbenchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to\n16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously. Our model\noutperforms other approaches in terms of realism and diversity on different\nmetrics and in a user study.

While the y-distortion can be\ndetected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the\n$\\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude\nsmaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a\nserious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\\mu$\narises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the\nprimordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \\approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here,\nwe present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly\ndetecting $\\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but\nwith an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we\noptimize the instrument's configuration to target $\\mu$ while robustly\nmarginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike\nFourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their\nindividual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing\nsignificant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the\n$\\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\\mu$-distortion at $\\approx 5\\sigma$ (10$\\sigma$)\nassuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission\nduration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized\nconfiguration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular\nresolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally\nmeasure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic\ncorrection at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total\nthermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12188v1) |\n| Exoplanet accretion monitoring spectroscopic survey (ENTROPY) I.\n  Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary-mass\n  object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C. Ringqvist, Dorian Demars, Markus Janson, Micka\u00ebl Bonnefoy, Yuhiko Aoyama, Gabriel-Dominique Marleau, Catherine Dougados, Judit Szul\u00e1gyi, Thanawuth Thanathibodee |   Accretion among planets is a poorly understood phenomenon, due to lack of\nboth observational and theoretical studies. Detection of emission lines from\naccreting gas giants facilitate detailed investigations into this process. This\nwork presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known\nyoung, planetary-mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf\n2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7-21 Mj and age 5-45 Myr, located at 45+-2\npc. We obtained the first high-resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target\nwith VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near-UV to visible wavelengths (3200-6800\nAA). We report resolved H3-H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.\nBased on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+-1\nkm/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR\nexcess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of\nthe parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+-63 K and radius to 1.5+-0.1\nRj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet-surface shock model\nimplies a pre-shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,-40) km/s and a pre-shock\ndensity of log(n0/cm^-3)=14(+0,-5). Pre-shock velocity points to a mass of\n6(+8,-4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary\nLline-Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of\n1.4(+2.8,-0.9)x10^-8 Mj/yr.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12187v1) |\n| Qwen2.5-Coder Technical Report | Binyuan Hui, Jian Yang, Zeyu Cui, Jiaxi Yang, Dayiheng Liu, Lei Zhang, Tianyu Liu, Jiajun Zhang, Bowen Yu, Kai Dang, An Yang, Rui Men, Fei Huang, Xingzhang Ren, Xuancheng Ren, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin |   In this report, we introduce the Qwen2.5-Coder series, a significant upgrade\nfrom its predecessor, CodeQwen1.5. This series includes two models:\nQwen2.5-Coder-1.5B and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B. As a code-specific model,\nQwen2.5-Coder is built upon the Qwen2.5 architecture and continues pretrained\non a vast corpus of over 5.5 trillion tokens. Through meticulous data cleaning,\nscalable synthetic data generation, and balanced data mixing, Qwen2.5-Coder\ndemonstrates impressive code generation capabilities while retaining general\nversatility. The model has been evaluated on a wide range of code-related\ntasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across more than 10\nbenchmarks, including code generation, completion, reasoning, and repair,\nconsistently outperforming larger models of the same model size. We believe\nthat the release of the Qwen2.5-Coder series will not only push the boundaries\nof research in code intelligence but also, through its permissive licensing,\nencourage broader adoption by developers in real-world applications.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12186v1) |\n| Disruption of a massive molecular cloud by a supernova in the Galactic\n  Centre: Initial results from the ACES project | M.

Xu |   The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our\nlocal solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions\nit exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong\ndynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).\nConsequently, it is likely that there are large-scale physical structures\nwithin the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we\npresent new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\n(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a\nmulti-wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the\nM0.8$-$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring-like morphology. We\nestimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring to be 79\"\nand 154\", respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre\ndistance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $> 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, a\nmass of $\\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\\odot$, and an expansion speed of $\\sim$ 20 km\ns$^{-1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($> 10^{51}$ erg) and\nmomentum ($> 10^7$ M$_\\odot$ km s$^{-1}$). We discuss several possible causes\nfor the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback\nand large-scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the\nM0.8$-$0.2 ring is a single high-energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain\nthe observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have\ntaken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which\nwe now see as the M0.8$-$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an\nextreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12185v1) |\n| To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic\n  reasoning | Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett |   Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting\nreasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of\ntasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted\na quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own\nevaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives\nstrong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with\nmuch smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the\nanswer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the\nquestion or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic\noperations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of\nCoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing\nagainst tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic\nexecution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our\nresults indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance\nwhile saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond\nprompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation\nacross the whole range of LLM applications.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183v1) |\n| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs | Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T. Chiu, Siyu Ren, Fei Yuan, Wenting Zhao, Zhiyong Wu, Alexander M. Rush |   Broad textual understanding and in-context learning require language models\nthat utilize full document contexts. Due to the implementation challenges\nassociated with directly training long-context models, many methods have been\nproposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to\ndifferences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these\napproaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long-context\nperformance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a\ncontrolled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation,\nutilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several\ninsights into long-context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of\nperplexity as a general-purpose performance indicator even in longer-context\ntasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods\nsystematically underperform across long-context tasks. Finally, we confirm that\nexact fine-tuning based methods are generally effective within the range of\ntheir extension, whereas extrapolation remains challenging. All codebases,\nmodels, and checkpoints will be made available open-source, promoting\ntransparency and facilitating further research in this critical area of AI\ndevelopment.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12181v1) |\n| Finetuning Language Models to Emit Linguistic Expressions of Uncertainty | Arslan Chaudhry, Sridhar Thiagarajan, Dilan Gorur |   Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in information-seeking\nand decision-making tasks. Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate\ninformation that conflicts with real-world facts, and their persuasive style\ncan make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result,\nend-users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with\nthe accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all\noutputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore\nsupervised finetuning on uncertainty-augmented predictions as a method to\ndevelop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty.\nSpecifically, we measure the calibration of pre-trained models and then\nfine-tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of\nuncertainty. Through experiments on various question-answering datasets, we\ndemonstrate that LLMs are well-calibrated in assessing their predictions, and\nsupervised finetuning based on the model's own confidence leads to\nwell-calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single-claim\nanswers.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12180v1) |\n| Computational Dynamical Systems | Jordan Cotler, Semon Rezchikov |   We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite-dimensional\ndynamical systems. Building off of previous work, we give definitions for what\nit means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine. We then\nshow that 'chaotic' dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and\n'integrable' dynamical systems (more generally, measure-preserving systems)\ncannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines can\nbe robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, we\nshow that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable\none-dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and\nmoreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt.\nMore broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one 'machine' to simulate\nanother, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low-complexity 'encoders' and\n'decoders' to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system\nbeing simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical\nsystem leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity\ntheory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12179v1) |\n| Poisson approximate likelihood compared to the particle filter | Yize Hao, Aaron A. Abkemeier, Edward L. Ionides |   Filtering algorithms are fundamental for inference on partially observed\nstochastic dynamic systems, since they provide access to the likelihood\nfunction and hence enable likelihood-based or Bayesian inference. A novel\nPoisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.\n(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering\na fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of\npartially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL\nis the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large\nimprovement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,\nbased on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.\n(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should\nuse PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence\nalso reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a\nshortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that\nthe comparison of log-likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al. (2023) is\nflawed because their PAL calculations were carried out using a dataset scaled\ndifferently from the previous study. If PAL and the particle filter are applied\nto the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears. On simulations\nwhere the model is correctly specified, the particle filter outperforms PAL.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12173v1) |\n| You Only Read Once (YORO): Learning to Internalize Database Knowledge\n  for Text-to-SQL | Hideo Kobayashi, Wuwei Lan, Peng Shi, Shuaichen Chang, Jiang Guo, Henghui Zhu, Zhiguo Wang, Patrick Ng |   While significant progress has been made on the text-to-SQL task, recent\nsolutions repeatedly encode the same database schema for every question,\nresulting in unnecessary high inference cost and often overlooking crucial\ndatabase knowledge. To address these issues, we propose You Only Read Once\n(YORO), a novel paradigm that directly internalizes database knowledge into the\nparametric knowledge of a text-to-SQL model during training and eliminates the\nneed for schema encoding during inference. YORO significantly reduces the input\ntoken length by 66%-98%. Despite its shorter inputs, our empirical results\ndemonstrate YORO's competitive performances with traditional systems on three\nbenchmarks as well as its significant outperformance on large databases.\nFurthermore, YORO excels in handling questions with challenging value\nretrievals such as abbreviation.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12172v1) |\n| Ergodic properties of infinite extension of symmetric interval exchange\n  transformations | Przemys\u0142aw Berk, Frank Trujillo, Hao Wu |   We prove that skew products with the cocycle given by the function\n$f(x)=a(x-1/2)$ with $a\\neq 0$ are ergodic for every ergodic symmetric IET in\nthe base, thus giving the full characterization of ergodic extensions in this\nfamily. Moreover, we prove that under an additional natural assumption of\nunique ergodicity on the IET, we can replace $f$ with any differentiable\nfunction with a non-zero sum of jumps. Finally, by considering weakly mixing\nIETs instead of just ergodic, we show that the skew products with cocycle given\nby $f$ have infinite ergodic index.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12168v1) |\n| multiPI-TransBTS: A Multi-Path Learning Framework for Brain Tumor Image\n  Segmentation Based on Multi-Physical Information | Hongjun Zhu, Jiaohang Huang, Kuo Chen, Xuehui Ying, Ying Qian |   Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis,\ntreatment planning, and monitoring the progression of brain tumors. However,\ndue to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across\ndifferent MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In\nthis study, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework, multiPI-TransBTS,\nwhich integrates multi-physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.\nThe model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi-modal\nimaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor\ncharacteristics. The multiPI-TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an\nAdaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi-source, multi-scale feature\ndecoder. The encoder incorporates a multi-branch architecture to separately\nextract modality-specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module\nfuses information from multiple sources using channel-wise and element-wise\nattention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both\ncommon and task-specific features through a Task-Specific Feature Introduction\n(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),\nTumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on\nthe BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nmultiPI-TransBTS over the state-of-the-art methods. The model consistently\nachieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,\nhighlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results\nalso indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision\nand recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a\nsignificant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving\nclinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12167v1) |\n| Synchrotron self-Compton in a radiative-adiabatic fireball scenario:\n  Modelling the multiwavelength observations in some Fermi/LAT bursts | Nissim Fraija, P. Veres, B. Betancourt Kamenetskaia, A. Galvan-Gamez, M. G. Dainotti, Simone Dichiara, R. L. Becerra |   Energetic GeV photons expected from the closest and the most energetic\nGamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provide an unique opportunity to study the\nvery-high-energy emission as well as the possible correlations with lower\nenergy bands in realistic GRB afterglow models. In the standard GRB afterglow\nmodel, the relativistic homogeneous shock is usually considered to be fully\nadiabatic, however, it could be partially radiative. Based on the external\nforward-shock scenario in both stellar wind and constant-density medium. We\npresent a radiative-adiabatic analytical model of the synchrotron self-Compton\n(SSC) and synchrotron processes considering an electron energy distribution\nwith a power-law index of 1 < p < 2 and 2 $\\leq$ p. We show that the SSC\nscenario plays a relevant role in the radiative parameter $\\epsilon$, leading\nto a prolonged evolution during the slow cooling regime. In a particular case,\nwe derive the Fermi/LAT light curves together with the photons with energies\n$\\geq$ 100 MeV in a sample of nine bursts from the second Fermi/LAT GRB catalog\nthat exhibited temporal and spectral indices with $\\geq$ 1.5 and $\\approx$ 2,\nrespectively. These events can hardly be described with closure relations of\nthe standard synchrotron afterglow model, and also exhibit energetic photons\nabove the synchrotron limit. We have modeled the multi-wavelength observations\nof our sample to constrain the microphysical parameters, the circumburst\ndensity, the bulk Lorentz factor and the mechanism responsible for explaining\nthe energetic GeV photons.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12166v1) |\n| Blind Deconvolution on Graphs: Exact and Stable Recovery | Chang Ye, Gonzalo Mateos |   We study a blind deconvolution problem on graphs, which arises in the context\nof localizing a few sources that diffuse over networks. While the observations\nare bilinear functions of the unknown graph filter coefficients and sparse\ninput signals, a mild requirement on invertibility of the diffusion filter\nenables an efficient convex relaxation leading to a linear programming\nformulation that can be tackled with off-the-shelf solvers. Under the\nBernoulli-Gaussian model for the inputs, we derive sufficient exact recovery\nconditions in the noise-free setting. A stable recovery result is then\nestablished, ensuring the estimation error remains manageable even when the\nobservations are corrupted by a small amount of noise. Numerical tests with\nsynthetic and real-world network data illustrate the merits of the proposed\nalgorithm, its robustness to noise as well as the benefits of leveraging\nmultiple signals to aid the (blind) localization of sources of diffusion. At a\nfundamental level, the results presented here broaden the scope of classical\nblind deconvolution of (spatio-)temporal signals to irregular graph domains.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12164v1) |\n| Generalized compression and compressive search of large datasets | Morgan E. Prior, Thomas Howard III, Emily Light, Najib Ishaq, Noah M. Daniels |   The Big Data explosion has necessitated the development of search algorithms\nthat scale sub-linearly in time and memory.\n  While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently,\nfew algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain-specific.\n  We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to\nperform $k$-NN and $\\rho$-NN search on compressed data while only decompressing\na small, relevant, portion of the data.\n  panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low-dimensional\nstructure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.\n  panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between\ntwo points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in\nterms of the other.\n  This property holds for many widely-used distance functions, e.g. string edit\ndistances (Levenshtein, Needleman-Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures\n(Jaccard, Dice, etc.).\n  We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic,\nand set data.\n  We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the\ncompressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.\n  panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering\nsub-linear time performance for $k$-NN and $\\rho$-NN search.\n  We conclude that panCAKES is an efficient, general-purpose algorithm for\nexact compressive search on large datasets that obey the manifold hypothesis.\n  We provide an open-source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming\nlanguage.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12161v1) |\n| WeHelp: A Shared Autonomy System for Wheelchair Users | Abulikemu Abuduweili, Alice Wu, Tianhao Wei, Weiye Zhao |   There is a large population of wheelchair users. Most of the wheelchair users\nneed help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs\nare not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this\nproject, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair\nusers. A robot with a WeHelp system has three modes, following mode, remote\ncontrol mode and tele-operation mode. In the following mode, the robot follows\nthe wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can\nask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the\nwheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech\nrecognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode.\nIn the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy\nstick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs,\nsuch as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high\nshelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant\ntakes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks\nfor their needs.

These IFSs\nexhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are\ntopologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the\nBlonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave\nsuperconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients\nincluding thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and\nexamine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage\nand temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of\n$d$-wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the\nnormal-superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric\nresponse. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in\nSeebeck coefficient ($\\sim 200\\,\\mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($\\sim 3.5$) due to the\ngeneration of the IFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for\ndevice applications.

Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker\nidentity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a NeRF-based network. Since we train our network on\nmonocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn\ndisentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio\nfeatures in a self-supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects.\nBy incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned\naudio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle\nmotion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer-based architecture\nthat learns expression features, capturing long-range facial expressions and\ndisentangling them from the speech-specific mouth movements. Through\nquantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can\nsynthesize high-fidelity talking face videos, achieving state-of-the-art facial\nexpression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12156v1) |\n| Autopet III challenge: Incorporating anatomical knowledge into nnUNet\n  for lesion segmentation in PET/CT | Hamza Kalisch, Fabian H\u00f6rst, Ken Herrmann, Jens Kleesiek, Constantin Seibold |   Lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging is essential for precise tumor\ncharacterization, which supports personalized treatment planning and enhances\ndiagnostic precision in oncology. However, accurate manual segmentation of\nlesions is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. Given the\nrising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods,\nparticularly deep-learning-based approaches, have become increasingly more\nrelevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation\nof tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting,\naddressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable\nsolutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET\nchallenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers\n(FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers. To this extent, we developed a\nclassifier that identifies the tracer of the given PET/CT based on the Maximum\nIntensity Projection of the PET scan. We trained two individual\nnnUNet-ensembles for each tracer where anatomical labels are included as a\nmulti-label task to enhance the model's performance.

However, a\nrobot's ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if\nnaively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach-avoid\ndynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a\nsafety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human's behavior\nas goal-driven but conditioned on the robot's plan, enabling us to capture\ninfluence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical\nand belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in\nhuman behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE\n(Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high-dimensional\n(39-D) simulated human-robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline\ngame-theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust\nbaseline that treats the human as a worst-case adversary, a safety controller\nthat does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy-function-based\nsafety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage\nthe influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing\nthe robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate\nduring task execution.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12153v1) |\n| Decoding Style: Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Image-Guided Outfit\n  Recommendation with Preference | Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan |   Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding\nboth fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper\npresents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their \"black box\" and static\nnature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item\nvisual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a\nMultimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style\nand color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis\nfor personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the\nopen-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability\nto recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative\nexamples is employed to enhance the LLM's decision-making process. This creates\na self-enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in\nline with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore\ndataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill-in-the-blank,\nand complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework's\nability to generate stylish, trend-aligned outfit suggestions, continuously\nimproving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our\nproposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more\ncohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the\nproposed framework's potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate\nsuggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit\ngeneration.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12150v1) |\n| Mechanical Wannier-Stark Ladder of Diamond Spin-Mechanical Lamb Wave\n  Resonators | Philip Andrango, Hailin Wang |   We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier-Stark ladders of\ndiamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with\nultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin\nproperties. Three nearest-neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric\nconfigurations and a large range of coupling rates have been explored for the\nrealization of Wannier-Stark ladders of LWRs, potentially enabling long-range\nconnectivity between spin qubits through their interactions with mechanical\nvibrations. Additional analysis on the effects of disorder indicates that the\nproposed Wannier-Stark ladder can be robust against realistic experimental\nimperfections. The development of mechanical quantum networks of spin qubits\nwith long-range connectivity can open the door to the implementation of newly\ndeveloped quantum low-density parity-check codes in solid-state systems.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12149v1) |\n| MAgICoRe: Multi-Agent, Iterative, Coarse-to-Fine Refinement for\n  Reasoning | Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Archiki Prasad, Swarnadeep Saha, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal |   Large Language Models' (LLM) reasoning can be improved using test-time\naggregation strategies, i.e., generating multiple samples and voting among\ngenerated samples. While these improve performance, they often reach a\nsaturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated\nfeedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key\nchallenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can\nover-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and\naddress errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to\nidentify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding\nhow many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too\nsoon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose\nMAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty\nas easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard\nones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error\nlocalization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores.\nMoreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with\nthree agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on\nstep-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure\nsufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating\nfurther rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5\nand show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of\nMAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by\n4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with\nbaselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our\nablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe's RMs and multi-agent\ncommunication.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147v1) |\n| Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka |   Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string\nprocessing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into\nblocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence\nof a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another\noccurrence earlier in $T$. Due to numerous applications, LZ77 factorization is\none of the most studied problems on strings. In the 47 years since its\ninception, several algorithms were developed for different models of\ncomputation, including parallel, GPU, external-memory, and quantum. Remarkably,\nhowever, the complexity of the most basic variant is still not settled: All\nexisting algorithms in the RAM model run in $\\Omega(n)$ time, which is a\n$\\Theta(\\log n)$ factor away from the lower bound of $\\Omega(n/\\log n)$\n(following from the necessity to read the input, which takes $\\Theta(n/\\log n)$\nspace for $T\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}$).\n  We present the first $o(n)$-time algorithm for LZ77 factorization, breaking\nthe linear-time barrier present for nearly 50 years. For $T\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}$, our\nalgorithm runs in $\\mathcal{O}(n/\\sqrt{\\log n})=o(n)$ time and uses the optimal\n$\\mathcal{O}(n/\\log n)$ working space. Our algorithm generalizes to\n$\\Sigma=[0..\\sigma)$, where $\\sigma=n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The runtime and\nworking space then become $\\mathcal{O}((n\\log\\sigma)/\\sqrt{\\log n})$ and\n$\\mathcal{O}(n/\\log_{\\sigma} n)$. To obtain our algorithm, we prove a more\ngeneral result: For any constant $\\epsilon\\in(0,1)$ and $T\\in[0..\\sigma)^{n}$,\nin $\\mathcal{O}((n\\log\\sigma)/\\sqrt{\\log n})$ time and using\n$\\mathcal{O}(n/\\log_{\\sigma}n)$ space, we can construct an\n$\\mathcal{O}(n/\\log_{\\sigma}n)$-size index that, given any $P=T[j..j+\\ell)$\n(represented as $(j,\\ell)$), computes the leftmost occurrence of $P$ in $T$ in\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log^{\\epsilon}n)$ time. In other words, we solve the\nindexing/online variant of the LZ77 problem.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12146v1) |\n| Experimental Evidence That Conversational Artificial Intelligence Can\n  Steer Consumer Behavior Without Detection | Tobias Werner, Ivan Soraperra, Emilio Calvano, David C.

In this\nreport, we introduce Takin AudioLLM, a series of techniques and models, mainly\nincluding Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, specifically designed for\naudiobook production. These models are capable of zero-shot speech production,\ngenerating high-quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human\nspeech and facilitating individuals to customize the speech content according\nto their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec\nlanguage model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a\nmulti-task training framework, capable of generating high-fidelity natural\nspeech in a zero-shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and\ntimbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while\nadvocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its\nnaturalness and expressiveness. Last, we propose the Takin Morphing system with\nhighly decoupled and advanced timbre and prosody modeling approaches, which\nenables individuals to customize speech production with their preferred timbre\nand prosody in a precise and controllable manner. Extensive experiments\nvalidate the effectiveness and robustness of our Takin AudioLLM series models.\nFor detailed demos, please refer to https://takinaudiollm.github.io.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12139v1) |\n| GRIN: GRadient-INformed MoE | Liyuan Liu, Young Jin Kim, Shuohang Wang, Chen Liang, Yelong Shen, Hao Cheng, Xiaodong Liu, Masahiro Tanaka, Xiaoxia Wu, Wenxiang Hu, Vishrav Chaudhary, Zeqi Lin, Chenruidong Zhang, Jilong Xue, Hany Awadalla, Jianfeng Gao, Weizhu Chen |   Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale more effectively than dense models due\nto sparse computation through expert routing, selectively activating only a\nsmall subset of expert modules. However, sparse computation challenges\ntraditional training practices, as discrete expert routing hinders standard\nbackpropagation and thus gradient-based optimization, which are the cornerstone\nof deep learning. To better pursue the scaling power of MoE, we introduce GRIN\n(GRadient-INformed MoE training), which incorporates sparse gradient estimation\nfor expert routing and configures model parallelism to avoid token dropping.\nApplying GRIN to autoregressive language modeling, we develop a top-2\n16$\\times$3.8B MoE model.

However, each approach has its own limitations,\nmaking it less effective to rely solely on either one. An emerging and\npromising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractive\nsummarization methods. Despite the plethora of studies in this domain, research\non the combined methodology remains scarce, particularly in the context of\nVietnamese language processing. This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDS\nframework leveraging a two-component pipeline architecture that integrates\nextractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs an\nextractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This is\nachieved by a modification of the pre-trained BERT network, which derives\nsemantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet network\nstructures. The second component utilizes the VBD-LLaMA2-7B-50b model for\nabstractive summarization, ultimately generating the final summary document.\nOur proposed framework demonstrates a positive performance, attaining ROUGE-2\nscores of 39.6% on the VN-MDS dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art\nbaselines.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12134v1) |\n| Einstein-dilaton-four-Maxwell Holographic Anisotropic Models | Irina Ya. Aref'eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov |   In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the\nfive-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell models has played a crucial role.\nTypically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while\nadditional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A\nmore general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field\nrepresents spatial longitudinal-transverse anisotropy, while the third and\nfourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We\nconsider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero\ntemperature and five functions at non-zero temperature. Maxwell field related\nto the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,\nwhereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.\nWe demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of\nthe seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations -- either the\ndilaton or the vector potential equation -- follows from the Einstein equations\nand the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi\nidentity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress-energy\ntensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is\nprovided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to\nthree Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis\nshows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein\nequations and the equation for the vector potential\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12131v1) |\n| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components\n  for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco-Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram |   Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data\ntogether with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal\ncomponents used. It is therefore important to determine the number of\nsignificant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a\nvariational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for\nestimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of\nsamples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This\neliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of\nprincipal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.\nThis framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows\nand columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),\nand with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data\nwith arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as\ncultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our\nmethod on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may\nunderestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the\nsynthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical\ndataset. These results suggest that it is broadly applicable across the life\nsciences.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12129v1) |\n| Linguini: A benchmark for language-agnostic linguistic reasoning | Eduardo S\u00e1nchez, Belen Alastruey, Christophe Ropers, Pontus Stenetorp, Mikel Artetxe, Marta R.

To attain high accuracy on this benchmark, models don't need previous\nknowledge of the tested language, as all the information needed to solve the\nlinguistic puzzle is presented in the context.

In this scenario, ultralight\nPBHs with masses $M\\lesssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat\nit via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate\nwhether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH\nreheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the\ninitial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer\nfunctions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and\nisocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation\nof state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH\ndominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the\nspectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive\nto $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density\nfluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance\nas a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\nobservations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the\ninitial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we\nfind that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several\nfuture GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope.

We\ninvestigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented\ndisplays having well-separated potential target-object locations. Performance\nwas compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption\nthat the information from the different potential target locations is\nstatistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than\noptimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the\nimplausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show\nthat three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical\nresults. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near\noptimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the\ncentral potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise\ncauses search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise.

We investigate different transverse system\nsizes $R$ and interaction strength $\\eta/s$ and identify universality classes\nbased upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each\nof this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $\\hat\n\\gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results\nhighlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum\nmoments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to\na 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of\ndifferent sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a\nsimilar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse\nflow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system\nsize and $\\eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and\ntheir response functions, along with the impact of the $\\eta/s$ and the system\ntransverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in\nmomentum space.

Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a\nmoment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching\nalgorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR).

Through a series of case studies,\nwe find that the common practice of omitting baselines or comparing against a\nweak baseline model (e.g. a linear model with no optimization) obscures the\nvalue of ML methods proposed in the research literature. Using these insights,\nwe propose some best practices that will enable practitioners to more\neffectively study and deploy ML models in clinical settings.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12116v1) |\n| Revisiting Dark Photon Constraints from CMB Spectral Distortions | Jens Chluba, Bryce Cyr, Matthew C. Johnson |   Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide\nstringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post-BBN (Big\nBang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models\nwith COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.\nHere, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark\nphoton conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous\nworks only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the\nchange to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon\ndistortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the\ndistortion has an opposite sign and a $\\simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We\nfurthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover\nthe redshift range $\\simeq 2\\times 10^6-4\\times 10^7$ between the $\\mu$-era and\nthe end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints\nfor dark photon masses in the range $10^{-4}\\,{\\rm eV}\\lesssim m_{\\rm\ndp}\\lesssim 10^{-3}\\,{\\rm eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We\ndemonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon\nto dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $\\mu$-type distortion\nindependent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study\ndark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with\nCMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12115v1) |\n| Bi-objective trail-planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous\n  environment | Cory M. Simon, Jeffrey Richley, Lucas Overbey, Darleen Perez-Lavin |   Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in\nresource delivery, patrolling, information-gathering, agriculture, forest fire\nfighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and\nsearch-and-rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments -- with e.g.\nrough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or\ncapturing robots -- should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of\nrisks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should\ntake the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the\nteam-level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward\nfrom visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider\nbi-objective trail-planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a\nhazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed\ngraph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of\nsurvival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a\nrobot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for\nthe Pareto-optimal robot-team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team\nobjectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive\nthe mission. A human decision-maker can then select trail plans that balance,\naccording to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony\noptimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto-optimal set of\nrobot team trail plans. As a case study, we illustrate with an\ninformation-gathering mission in an art museum.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12114v1) |\n| Pareto Data Framework: Steps Towards Resource-Efficient Decision Making\n  Using Minimum Viable Data (MVD) | Tashfain Ahmed, Josh Siegel |   This paper introduces the Pareto Data Framework, an approach for identifying\nand selecting the Minimum Viable Data (MVD) required for enabling machine\nlearning applications on constrained platforms such as embedded systems, mobile\ndevices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We demonstrate that strategic\ndata reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing\nbandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies\nMinimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource-constrained\nenvironments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient\npractices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and\noverprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for\noptimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data\nrepresentation. An experimental methodology demonstrates effective acoustic\ndata characterization after downsampling, quantization, and truncation to\nsimulate reduced-fidelity sensors and network and storage constraints; results\nshows that performance can be maintained up to 95\\% with sample rates reduced\nby 75\\% and bit depths and clip length reduced by 50\\% which translates into\nsubstantial cost and resource reduction. These findings have implications on\nthe design and development of constrained systems. The paper also discusses\nbroader implications of the framework, including the potential to democratize\nadvanced AI technologies across IoT applications and sectors such as\nagriculture, transportation, and manufacturing to improve access and multiply\nthe benefits of data-driven insights.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12112v1) |\n| Applications of Knowledge Distillation in Remote Sensing: A Survey | Yassine Himeur, Nour Aburaed, Omar Elharrouss, Iraklis Varlamis, Shadi Atalla, Wathiq Mansoor, Hussain Al Ahmad |   With the ever-growing complexity of models in the field of remote sensing\n(RS), there is an increasing demand for solutions that balance model accuracy\nwith computational efficiency. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a\npowerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,\ncomplex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in\nperformance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and\nits innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer\nknowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact\nand efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application\nacross various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and\nhistorical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are\nhighlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational\nefficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical\ndeployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of\nKD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the\nbreadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case\nstudies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,\nsuch as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review\ndiscusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical\nconstraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive\noverview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS. Through this\norganization, the paper not only elucidates the current state of research in KD\nbut also sets the stage for future research opportunities, thereby contributing\nsignificantly to both academic research and real-world applications.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12111v1) |\n| It depends: Varieties of defining growth dependence | Anja Janischewski, Katharina Bohnenberger, Matthias Kranke, Tobias Vogel, Riwan Driouich, Tobias Froese, Stefanie Gerold, Raphael Kaufmann, Lorenz Key\u00dfer, Jannis Niethammer, Christopher Olk, Matthias Schmelzer, Asl\u0131 Y\u00fcr\u00fck, Steffen Lange |   Many socio-economic systems require positive economic growth rates to\nfunction properly. Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing\nevidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,\nthese growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,\nmore and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth-dependent systems\nand develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of\n'growth dependence' still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,\nwhich impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article\nproposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the\nconcept of 'growth dependence' across socio-economic systems. We provide a\ngeneral definition consisting of four components that can be specified for\ndifferent empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of\nmeasurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions\nor properties of the system under investigation. According to our general\ndefinition, a socio-economic system is growth-dependent if it requires a\nlong-term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to\nmaintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen\nnormative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to\nthree areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:\nemployment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies\ndemonstrate that whether or not a system is growth-dependent hinges not only on\nthe empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of\nthe concept of growth dependence. Our framework enables coherent, robust and\neffective definitions and research questions, fostering comparability of\nfindings across different cases and disciplines.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12109v1) |\n| SPRMamba: Surgical Phase Recognition for Endoscopic Submucosal\n  Dissection with Mamba | Xiangning Zhang, Jinnan Chen, Qingwei Zhang, Chengfeng Zhou, Zhengjie Zhang, Xiaobo Li, Dahong Qian |   Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive procedure\ninitially designed for the treatment of early gastric cancer but is now widely\nused for various gastrointestinal lesions. Computer-assisted Surgery systems\nhave played a crucial role in improving the precision and safety of ESD\nprocedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognition\nof surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesion\ncharacteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real-time\nsurgical phase recognition algorithms. Existing surgical phase recognition\nalgorithms struggle to efficiently capture temporal contexts in video-based\nscenarios, leading to insufficient performance. To address these issues, we\npropose SPRMamba, a novel Mamba-based framework for ESD surgical phase\nrecognition. SPRMamba leverages the strengths of Mamba for long-term temporal\nmodeling while introducing the Scaled Residual TranMamba block to enhance the\ncapture of fine-grained details, overcoming the limitations of traditional\ntemporal models like Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformers.\nMoreover, a Temporal Sample Strategy is introduced to accelerate the\nprocessing, which is essential for real-time phase recognition in clinical\nsettings. Extensive testing on the ESD385 dataset and the cholecystectomy\nCholec80 dataset demonstrates that SPRMamba surpasses existing state-of-the-art\nmethods and exhibits greater robustness across various surgical phase\nrecognition tasks.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12108v1) |\n| Who's the GOAT?

In this work, we design a\ndata-driven random walk on the symmetric group to obtain a stationary\ndistribution over player rankings, spanning across different time periods in\nsports history. We combine this distribution with a notion of stochastic\ndominance to obtain a partial order over the players. We implement our methods\nusing publicly available data from the Association of Tennis Professionals\n(ATP) and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) to find the GOATs in the\nrespective categories.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12107v1) |\n| Measuring Human and AI Values based on Generative Psychometrics with\n  Large Language Models | Haoran Ye, Yuhang Xie, Yuanyi Ren, Hanjun Fang, Xin Zhang, Guojie Song |   Human values and their measurement are long-standing interdisciplinary\ninquiry. Recent advances in AI have sparked renewed interest in this area, with\nlarge language models (LLMs) emerging as both tools and subjects of value\nmeasurement. This work introduces Generative Psychometrics for Values (GPV), an\nLLM-based, data-driven value measurement paradigm, theoretically grounded in\ntext-revealed selective perceptions. We begin by fine-tuning an LLM for\naccurate perception-level value measurement and verifying the capability of\nLLMs to parse texts into perceptions, forming the core of the GPV pipeline.\nApplying GPV to human-authored blogs, we demonstrate its stability, validity,\nand superiority over prior psychological tools. Then, extending GPV to LLM\nvalue measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometric\nmethodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free-form\noutputs, enabling context-specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis of\nmeasurement paradigms, indicating response biases of prior methods; and 3) an\nattempt to bridge LLM values and their safety, revealing the predictive power\nof different value systems and the impacts of various values on LLM safety.\nThrough interdisciplinary efforts, we aim to leverage AI for next-generation\npsychometrics and psychometrics for value-aligned AI.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12106v1) |\n| FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated\n  Long-Tailed Learning | Xiuhua Lu, Peng Li, Xuefeng Jiang |   Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy\nin distributed machine learning. However, datasets distributed across each\nclient in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can\nbe globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly\naffects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated\nlearning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it\nfails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data.\nThis results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting\nthe equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a\nmethodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,\nwe propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the\nlocal training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred\noptimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state-of-the-art\nmethods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed\ndistribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10-LT and\nCIFAR-100-LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of\nmodel performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long-tailed\ndistribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12105v1) |\n| Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error\n  Detection | Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia |   Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications. Doing\nso requires overcoming the noise present on today's hardware. The quantum\napproximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling\nup due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup\nover state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems. However,\nachieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require\nfault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant\nimplementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection\ncode. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the\nalgorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with\nup to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we\npropose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance, and use it\nto characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance\nto future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our\nmodel can be used to determine necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform\nGoemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware. Our results demonstrate the\nlargest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially\nfault-tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date,\npaving the way towards solving real-world applications with quantum computers.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12104v1) |\n| Cyclicity Analysis of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process | Vivek Kaushik |   In this thesis, we consider an $N$-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)\nprocess satisfying the linear stochastic differential equation $d\\mathbf x(t) =\n- \\mathbf B\\mathbf x(t) dt + \\boldsymbol \\Sigma d \\mathbf w(t).$ Here, $\\mathbf\nB$ is a fixed $N \\times N$ circulant friction matrix whose eigenvalues have\npositive real parts, $\\boldsymbol \\Sigma$ is a fixed $N \\times M$ matrix. We\nconsider a signal propagation model governed by this OU process. In this model,\nan underlying signal propagates throughout a network consisting of $N$ linked\nsensors located in space. We interpret the $n$-th component of the OU process\nas the measurement of the propagating effect made by the $n$-th sensor. The\nmatrix $\\mathbf B$ represents the sensor network structure: if $\\mathbf B$ has\nfirst row $(b_1 \\ , \\ \\dots \\ , \\ b_N),$ where $b_1>0$ and $b_2 \\ , \\ \\dots \\\n,\\ b_N \\le 0,$ then the magnitude of $b_p$ quantifies how receptive the $n$-th\nsensor is to activity within the $(n+p-1)$-th sensor. Finally, the $(m,n)$-th\nentry of the matrix $\\mathbf D = \\frac{\\boldsymbol \\Sigma \\boldsymbol\n\\Sigma^\\text T}{2}$ is the covariance of the component noises injected into the\n$m$-th and $n$-th sensors. For different choices of $\\mathbf B$ and\n$\\boldsymbol \\Sigma,$ we investigate whether Cyclicity Analysis enables us to\nrecover the structure of network. Roughly speaking, Cyclicity Analysis studies\nthe lead-lag dynamics pertaining to the components of a multivariate signal. We\nspecifically consider an $N \\times N$ skew-symmetric matrix $\\mathbf Q,$ known\nas the lead matrix, in which the sign of its $(m,n)$-th entry captures the\nlead-lag relationship between the $m$-th and $n$-th component OU processes.

Recently, this\ncuriosity has motivated the fMRI-to-image reconstruction task; given the fMRI\ndata from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual\nstimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent\nDiffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex\nvisual stimuli such as high-resolution natural images from vision datasets.\nDespite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often\nlack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.\nConsequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere\nvisuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs\neffectively incorporate multi-modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,\nand image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image\ngenerations. Specifically, inspired by the two-streams hypothesis suggesting\nthat perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain\nregions, our framework, Brain-Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain\nregions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from\nsemantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information\nregions, Brain-Streams provides accurate multi-modal guidance to LDMs. We\nvalidate the reconstruction ability of Brain-Streams both quantitatively and\nqualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI\ndata.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12099v1) |\n| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal\n  execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huy\u00ean Pham |   Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and\nconstraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity\nmarkets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general\npropagator model under linear functional inequality constraints.

The task of\nnext-best-view (NBV) planning is to infer the pose of the next viewpoint based\non the current data, and gradually realize the complete three-dimensional\nreconstruction. Many existing algorithms, however, suffer a large computational\nburden due to the use of ray-casting. To address this, this paper proposes a\nprojection-based NBV planning framework. It can select the next best view at an\nextremely fast speed while ensuring the complete scanning of the object.\nSpecifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into\nellipsoids based on the voxel structure.Then, the next best view is selected\nfrom the candidate views using a projection-based viewpoint quality evaluation\nfunction in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy. This process\nreplaces the ray-casting in voxel structures, significantly improving the\ncomputational efficiency. Comparative experiments with other algorithms in a\nsimulation environment show that the framework proposed in this paper can\nachieve 10 times efficiency improvement on the basis of capturing roughly the\nsame coverage.

Recent observations of decayless transverse oscillations have shown\ntwo branches in the relationship between periods and loop lengths. One is a\nlinear relationship, interpreted as a standing mode. The other shows almost no\ncorrelation and has not yet been interpreted conclusively. Aims. We\ninvestigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless\noscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely\nfollow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations\nare standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations\nwhere the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase\nare randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal\nby considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of\ntelescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast\nFourier transform. Results. When the sampling cadence is getting closer to the\nactual oscillation period, a tendency for overestimating periods in short loops\nis enhanced. The relationship between loop lengths and periods of the sampled\nsignals shows the two branches as in the observation. Conclusions. We find that\nlong periods of decayless oscillations occurring in short loops could be the\nresult of undersampling.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12095v1) |\n| Enwrapped Perylene Bisimide Enables Room Temperature Polariton Lasing\n  and Photonic Lattices | Dominik Horneber, Johannes D\u00fcreth, Tim Schembri, Simon Betzold, Matthias Stolte, Sven H\u00f6fling, Frank W\u00fcrthner, Sebastian Klembt |   Perylene bisimides (PBIs) are organic dyes with photoluminescence quantum\nyields (PLQY) close to unity in solution and great thermal and photo-chemical\nstability. These features alongside the tunability of their solid-state packing\narrangement via chemical functionalization make this material class an\nexcellent candidate for exciton-polariton lasing at room temperature. Polariton\nlasing is well understood in III-V semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures,\nhowever, the search for emitter materials for robust and versatile room\ntemperature applications is ongoing. While e.g. perovskites and several organic\nmaterials have been identified to support polariton lasing, many of these\nmaterials lack tunability and long-term stability under ambient conditions.\nHere, we fabricate optical microcavities using a strongly enwrapped PBI\nchromophore with prevailing monomer-like absorption and emission properties in\nthe solid state. Voluminous bay-substituents prevent stacking induced\nPLQY-quenching, thereby enabling polariton lasing at room temperature.\nAdditionally, photonic confinement in single hemispheric resonators is\ndemonstrated leading to localized polaritonic modes with discrete energies, as\nwell as optical lattices revealing distinct polaritonic band-structures.

However, acquiring diverse\nfood items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents\nunique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric\ninformation (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g.,\ncolor, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially\nwhen foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance.\nWe employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition.\nExisting methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy\nbased on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, such\nrepresentations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse\nacquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\napproach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which\nintegrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance\nthe robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach\ncaptures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular,\nliquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and\nintroduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and\nassess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies\nbased on context, improving the robot's capability to handle diverse food\nacquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach's\nrobustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations,\nincluding zero-shot generalization to unseen settings.

To navigate such environments,\nagents benefit from information on the various elements (e.g., buttons, text,\nor images) present. It remains unclear which element attributes have the\ngreatest impact on agent performance, especially in environments that only\nprovide a graphical representation (i.e., pixels). Here we find that the\nordering in which elements are presented to the language model is surprisingly\nimpactful--randomizing element ordering in a webpage degrades agent performance\ncomparably to removing all visible text from an agent's state representation.\nWhile a webpage provides a hierarchical ordering of elements, there is no such\nordering when parsing elements directly from pixels. Moreover, as tasks become\nmore challenging and models more sophisticated, our experiments suggest that\nthe impact of ordering increases. Finding an effective ordering is non-trivial.\nWe investigate the impact of various element ordering methods in web and\ndesktop environments. We find that dimensionality reduction provides a viable\nordering for pixel-only environments. We train a UI element detection model to\nderive elements from pixels and apply our findings to an agent\nbenchmark--OmniACT--where we only have access to pixels.

At zero temperature for baryon chemical potentials below\nthe mass of the Lambda baryon, only nucleons contribute to the quark density.\nThis is different at finite temperature, where all baryons, mesons and their\nresonances can be excited and thus add quarks to the phase space. The\nprobability density to find a quark inside a hadron is determined using the\nYukawa ansatz of the IdylliQ model of Quarkyonic Matter. We estimate separately\nthe magnitude of the various contributions of nucleons, Delta baryons, pions as\nwell as further hadrons and resonances. The uncertainty in the parametrization\nof the probability density to find a quark inside a nucleon is spanned by\nassuming that at zero temperature the transition density to Quarkyonic Matter\nis between one and three times that of nuclear matter. Various predictions for\na possible critical point associated with the chiral phase transition are found\nclose to a triple point at which the line of the deconfinement transition and\nthe curve associated with the transition to Quarkyonic Matter intersect. These\nconsiderations provide an estimate for the region in the QCD phase diagram\nwhere Quarkyonic Matter may be found.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12088v1) |\n| Towards Interpretable End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Prediction:\n  Utilizing Administrative Claims Data with Explainable AI Techniques | Yubo Li, Saba Al-Sayouri, Rema Padman |   This study explores the potential of utilizing administrative claims data,\ncombined with advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, to\npredict the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to End-Stage Renal\nDisease (ESRD).

Over the past decade, numerous endeavours have been undertaken in\nthe literature to develop methods for efficiently distinguishing boosted top\nquark jets from QCD jets. Although cut-based strategies for boosted top\ntagging, which rely on substructure information from fat jets resulting from\nthe hadronic decay of boosted top quarks, were introduced in the literature as\nearly as 2008, recent years have witnessed a surge in the utilization of\nmachine learning-based approaches for the classification of top-jets from QCD\njets.

Agyeman, Jinfeng Liu, Sirish L. Shah |   Efficient water management in agriculture is important for mitigating the\ngrowing freshwater scarcity crisis. Mixed-integer Model Predictive Control\n(MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex\nscheduling problems in agricultural irrigation. However, the computational\ncomplexity of mixed-integer MPC still poses a significant challenge,\nparticularly in large-scale applications. This study proposes an approach to\nenhance the computational efficiency of mixed-integer MPC-based irrigation\nschedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture\ndynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed-integer linear\nrepresentation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the\nmixed-integer MPC-based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a\nmixed-integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed-integer\nnonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global\noptimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated\nthrough comparative studies conducted on a large-scale agricultural field\nacross two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models,\nspecifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used\ntriggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU-based approach significantly\nreduces solution times -- by up to 99.5\\% -- while achieving comparable\nperformance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water\nUse Efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, the ReLU-based approach maintains enhanced\nperformance in terms of total prescribed irrigation and IWUE compared to the\nwidely-used triggered irrigation scheduling method.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12082v1) |\n| Design of Ligand-Binding Proteins with Atomic Flow Matching | Junqi Liu, Shaoning Li, Chence Shi, Zhi Yang, Jian Tang |   Designing novel proteins that bind to small molecules is a long-standing\nchallenge in computational biology, with applications in developing catalysts,\nbiosensors, and more. Current computational methods rely on the assumption that\nthe binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible,\nas conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon\nbinding. In this work, we formulate proteins and molecules as unified\nbiotokens, and present AtomFlow, a novel deep generative model under the\nflow-matching framework for the design of ligand-binding proteins from the 2D\ntarget molecular graph alone. Operating on representative atoms of biotokens,\nAtomFlow captures the flexibility of ligands and generates ligand conformations\nand protein backbone structures iteratively. We consider the multi-scale nature\nof biotokens and demonstrate that AtomFlow can be effectively trained on a\nsubset of structures from the Protein Data Bank, by matching flow vector field\nusing an SE(3) equivariant structure prediction network. Experimental results\nshow that our method can generate high fidelity ligand-binding proteins and\nachieve performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model RFDiffusionAA,\nwhile not requiring bound ligand structures. As a general framework, AtomFlow\nholds the potential to be applied to various biomolecule generation tasks in\nthe future.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12080v1) |\n| Denoising diffusion models for high-resolution microscopy image\n  restoration | Pamela Osuna-Vargas, Maren H. Wehrheim, Lucas Zinz, Johanna Rahm, Ashwin Balakrishnan, Alexandra Kaminer, Mike Heilemann, Matthias Kaschube |   Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at\nthe nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological\norganization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of\nfluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses\nremain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced\nlaser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and\nincreased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a\ndenoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high-resolution\nimages by conditioning the model on low-resolution information. Additionally,\nthe probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images\nthat tend to further increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We show that our model\nachieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously\nbest-performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly,\nwhile any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but\nnot all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all\nfour data sets, suggesting high generalizability.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12078v1) |\n| Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Via Data Pruning | Andrea Napoli, Paul White |   The removal of carefully-selected examples from training data has recently\nemerged as an effective way of improving the robustness of machine learning\nmodels. However, the best way to select these examples remains an open\nquestion. In this paper, we consider the problem from the perspective of\nunsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). We propose AdaPrune, a method for UDA\nwhereby training examples are removed to attempt to align the training\ndistribution to that of the target data. By adopting the maximum mean\ndiscrepancy (MMD) as the criterion for alignment, the problem can be neatly\nformulated and solved as an integer quadratic program. We evaluate our approach\non a real-world domain shift task of bioacoustic event detection. As a method\nfor UDA, we show that AdaPrune outperforms related techniques, and is\ncomplementary to other UDA algorithms such as CORAL. Our analysis of the\nrelationship between the MMD and model accuracy, along with t-SNE plots,\nvalidate the proposed method as a principled and well-founded way of performing\ndata pruning.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12076v1) |\n| The elastica sling | Alessandro Cazzolli, Francesco Dal Corso |   The nonlinear mechanics of a flexible elastic rod constrained at its edges by\na pair of sliding sleeves is analyzed. The planar equilibrium configurations of\nthis variable-length elastica are found to have shape defined only by the\ninclination of the two constraints, while their distance is responsible only\nfor scaling the size. By extending the theoretical stability criterion\navailable for systems under isoperimetric constraints to the case of variable\ndomains, the existence of no more than one stable equilibrium solution is\nrevealed. The set of sliding sleeves' inclination pairs for which the stability\nis lost are identified. Such critical conditions allow the indefinite ejection\nof the flexible rod from the sliding sleeves, thus realizing an elastica sling.\nFinally, the theoretical findings are validated by experiments on a physical\nprototype.

The refractive index is estimated online as a state\nvariable of a monocular visual-inertial odometry framework in an iterative\nformulation using the proposed camera model. The method was verified on data\ncollected using an underwater robot traversing inside a pool. The evaluations\ndemonstrate convergence to the ideal refractive index for water despite\nsignificant perturbations in the initialization. Simultaneously, the approach\nenables on-par visual-inertial odometry performance in refractive media without\nprior knowledge of the refractive index or requirement of medium-specific\ncamera calibration.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12074v1) |\n| Influence of dislocations in multilayer graphene stacks: A phase field\n  crystal study | K. R. Elder, Zhi-Feng Huang, T. Ala-Nissila |   In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene\nstacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a\nrecently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems\nincorporating out-of-plane deformations and parameterized to match to density\nfunctional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems. The\nspecific configuration considered consists of one monolayer containing four\n$5|7$ dislocations (i.e., two dislocation dipoles) sandwiched in between\nperfect graphene layers. The study reveals how the strain field from the\ndislocations in the defected layer leads to out-of-plane deformations that in\nturn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are\nmade for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a\ndefect-free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and\nsystem size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by\nroughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence\nacross the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height\nprofiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12073v1) |\n| PAD-FT: A Lightweight Defense for Backdoor Attacks via Data Purification\n  and Fine-Tuning | Yukai Xu, Yujie Gu, Kouichi Sakurai |   Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks,\nparticularly as recent advancements have led to increasingly subtle\nimplantation, making the defense more challenging. Existing defense mechanisms\ntypically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and\ninvolve retraining an auxiliary model or fine-tuning the entire victim model.\nHowever, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always\nfeasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and\nlightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD-FT, that does not require an\nadditional clean dataset and fine-tunes only a very small part of the model to\ndisinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a\nsimple data purification process to identify and select the most-likely clean\ndata from the poisoned training dataset. The self-purified clean dataset is\nthen used for activation clipping and fine-tuning only the last classification\nlayer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation\nclipping, and classifier fine-tuning, our mechanism PAD-FT demonstrates\nsuperior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as\nconfirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12072v1) |\n| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing\n  data in Irish sagas | P.

This has allowed us to identify\nsimilarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the\nsignificance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture\nrequires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and\noften impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the\nnetwork of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that\nthe top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent\nwith central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has\nbeen lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust\nto a large random removal of edges.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12071v1) |\n| The repetition threshold for ternary rich words | James D. Currie, Lucas Mol, Jarkko Peltom\u00e4ki |   In 2014, Vesti proposed the problem of determining the repetition threshold\nfor infinite rich words, i.e., for infinite words in which all factors of\nlength $n$ contain $n$ distinct nonempty palindromic factors. In 2020, Currie,\nMol, and Rampersad proved a conjecture of Baranwal and Shallit that the\nrepetition threshold for binary rich words is $2 + \\sqrt{2}/2$. In this paper,\nwe prove a structure theorem for $16/7$-power-free ternary rich words. Using\nthe structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich\nwords is $1 + 1/(3 - \\mu) \\approx 2.25876324$, where $\\mu$ is the unique real\nroot of the polynomial $x^3 - 2x^2 - 1$.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12068v1) |\n| Fitting Multilevel Factor Models | Tetiana Parshakova, Trevor Hastie, Stephen Boyd |   We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance\ngiven by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~\\cite{parshakova2023factor}.

Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by\ntidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to\ntheir proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the\nTRAPPIST-1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In\nthis work, we present the recent implementation of the co-planar tidal torque\nand forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N-body code\nPosidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using\na tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of\neach planet by taking into account their multi-layer internal structure\ncomputed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets\nare not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state.\nPlanet-planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and\ntides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a\nresult, the sub-stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and\nlong-timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with\nperiods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12065v1) |\n| Quantum Magic and Multi-Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei | Florian Br\u00f6kemeier, S. Momme Hengstenberg, James W. T. Keeble, Caroline E. P. Robin, Federico Rocco, Martin J. Savage |   Motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the\nquantum complexity of $p$-shell and $sd$-shell nuclei. Valence-space nuclear\nshell-model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit\nregisters using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$-shell and 24\nqubits for the $sd$-shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement\n($n$-tangles) and magic (non-stabilizerness) are determined. While exact\nevaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of\nactive nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex\nnuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique\nis introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed\nnuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\\sim 8$ for some\nnuclei. Significant multi-nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$-shell,\ndominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of\nmagic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on\nthe path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion.\nThese results indicate that quantum-computing resources will accelerate\nprecision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12064v1) |\n| Post-Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a\n  massive, rotating object | Lorenzo Iorio |   The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the\ngeneral relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring\ncomponents of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are\nanalytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level. To the Newtonian\norder, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as\nwell. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation\nin space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the\nprimary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first\nto 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system\nalong an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred\nclose to the Sun's flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due\nto the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of\nmicroarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for\nthe post-Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)\nspacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of\nthe latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current\n(formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would\nbring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the\npredicted relativistic disturbances.

To address these\nconcerns, recent research has focused on developing zero-knowledge machine\nlearning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of\nML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have\nsubstantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily\noptimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the\nsubstantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the\nmodel and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new\nCommit-and-Prove SNARK (CP-SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that\neffectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML\npipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white-box use of the\nunderlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic\npolynomial commitment and only makes black-box use of the proof system. As a\nresult, Artemis is compatible with state-of-the-art proof systems without\ntrusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP-SNARKs, evaluate\ntheir performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial\nimprovements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover\ncosts and maintaining efficiency even for large-scale models. For example, for\nthe VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from\n11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML\ntowards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and\ncomplex ML models.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12055v1) |\n| MMP for Enriques pairs and singular Enriques varieties | Francesco Antonio Denisi, \u00c1ngel David R\u00edos Ortiz, Nikolaos Tsakanikas, Zhixin Xie |   We introduce and study the class of primitive Enriques varieties, whose\nsmooth members are Enriques manifolds.

In this paper we present a new version of the\ncode that extends the available finite groups, previously limited to simply\nreducible point groups, in a way that all point and double groups become\naccessible. It also includes the full spin-orbital rotation group. Moreover, to\nimprove the code's flexibility for impurities with complex interactions, this\nnew version allows to choose between a standard Anderson Hamiltonian for the\nimpurity or, as another novel feature, an ionic model that requires only the\nspectrum and the impurity Lehmann amplitudes.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12050v1) |\n| Quantum-like nonlinear interferometry with frequency-engineered\n  classical light | Romain Dalidet, Anthony Martin, Gr\u00e9gory Sauder, Laurent Labont\u00e9, S\u00e9bastien Tanzilli |   Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic\nentanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits. Nonlinear\noptics has served as a workhorse for the generation of entangled photon pairs,\nensuring both energy and phase conservation, but at the cost of limited rate\nand degraded signal-to-noise ratio compared to laser-based interferometry\napproaches. We present a \"quantum-like\" nonlinear optical method that reaches\nsuper-resolution in single-photon detection regime. This is achieved by\nreplacing photon-pairs by coherent states of light, mimicking quantum\nproperties through classical nonlinear optics processes. Our scheme utilizes\ntwo high-brightness lasers. This results in a substantially greater\nsignal-to-noise ratio compared to its quantum counterpart. Such an approach\npaves the way to significantly reduced acquisition times, providing a pathway\nto explore signals across a broader range of bandwidth. The need to increase\nthe frequency bandwidth of the quantum sensor significantly motivates the\npotential applications of this pathway.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12049v1) |\n| A Survey-Based Quantitative Analysis of Stress Factors and Their Impacts\n  Among Cybersecurity Professionals | Sunil Arora, John D. Hastings |   This study investigates the prevalence and underlying causes of work-related\nstress and burnout among cybersecurity professionals using a quantitative\nsurvey approach guided by the Job Demands-Resources model. Analysis of\nresponses from 50 cybersecurity practitioners reveals an alarming reality: 44%\nreport experiencing severe work-related stress and burnout, while an additional\n28% are uncertain about their condition. The demanding nature of cybersecurity\nroles, unrealistic expectations, and unsupportive organizational cultures\nemerge as primary factors fueling this crisis. Notably, 66% of respondents\nperceive cybersecurity jobs as more stressful than other IT positions, with 84%\nfacing additional challenges due to the pandemic and recent high-profile\nbreaches. The study finds that most cybersecurity experts are reluctant to\nreport their struggles to management, perpetuating a cycle of silence and\nneglect. To address this critical issue, the paper recommends that\norganizations foster supportive work environments, implement mindfulness\nprograms, and address systemic challenges. By prioritizing the mental health of\ncybersecurity professionals, organizations can cultivate a more resilient and\neffective workforce to protect against an ever-evolving threat landscape.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12047v1) |\n| Using Large Language Models to Generate Clinical Trial Tables and\n  Figures | Yumeng Yang, Peter Krusche, Kristyn Pantoja, Cheng Shi, Ethan Ludmir, Kirk Roberts, Gen Zhu |   Tables, figures, and listings (TFLs) are essential tools for summarizing\nclinical trial data. Creation of TFLs for reporting activities is often a\ntime-consuming task encountered routinely during the execution of clinical\ntrials. This study explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate\nthe generation of TFLs through prompt engineering and few-shot transfer\nlearning. Using public clinical trial data in ADaM format, our results\ndemonstrated that LLMs can efficiently generate TFLs with prompt instructions,\nshowcasing their potential in this domain. Furthermore, we developed a\nconservational agent named Clinical Trial TFL Generation Agent: An app that\nmatches user queries to predefined prompts that produce customized programs to\ngenerate specific predefined TFLs.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12046v2) |\n| Handling Long-Term Safety and Uncertainty in Safe Reinforcement Learning | Jonas G\u00fcnster, Puze Liu, Jan Peters, Davide Tateo |   Safety is one of the key issues preventing the deployment of reinforcement\nlearning techniques in real-world robots. While most approaches in the Safe\nReinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and\nrobot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them\nin complex real-world settings. Instead, model-based approaches that\nincorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning\nframework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on\nthe real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot\ndynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task-specific and hard\nto obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to\ncompute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long-term safety\nrequirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe\nexploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus\non ensuring long-term safety and handling of uncertainty. Our approach is\ncompetitive or superior to state-of-the-art methods in final performance while\nmaintaining safer behavior during training.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12045v1) |\n| Quasiperiodic Floquet-Gibbs states in Rydberg atomic systems | Wilson S. Martins, Federico Carollo, Kay Brandner, Igor Lesanovsky |   Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by\nfast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an\nequilibrium-like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet-Magnus\nHamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi's golden rule, we show\nthat such Floquet-Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated\nRydberg atomic systems, whose lab-frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function\nof time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the\nsystem, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which\nis necessary to uphold high-lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To\ncorroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five\ninteracting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate\nnumerically that the second-order Floquet-Gibbs state of this system is\nessentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding\nRedfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently\nlarge.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12044v1) |\n| Understanding the Effects of the Baidu-ULTR Logging Policy on Two-Tower\n  Models | Morris de Haan, Philipp Hager |   Despite the popularity of the two-tower model for unbiased learning to rank\n(ULTR) tasks, recent work suggests that it suffers from a major limitation that\ncould lead to its collapse in industry applications: the problem of logging\npolicy confounding. Several potential solutions have even been proposed;\nhowever, the evaluation of these methods was mostly conducted using\nsemi-synthetic simulation experiments. This paper bridges the gap between\ntheory and practice by investigating the confounding problem on the largest\nreal-world dataset, Baidu-ULTR. Our main contributions are threefold: 1) we\nshow that the conditions for the confounding problem are given on Baidu-ULTR,\n2) the confounding problem bears no significant effect on the two-tower model,\nand 3) we point to a potential mismatch between expert annotations, the golden\nstandard in ULTR, and user click behavior.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12043v1) |\n| ASR Benchmarking: Need for a More Representative Conversational Dataset | Gaurav Maheshwari, Dmitry Ivanov, Th\u00e9o Johannet, Kevin El Haddad |   Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable\nperformance on widely used benchmarks such as LibriSpeech and Fleurs. However,\nthese benchmarks do not adequately reflect the complexities of real-world\nconversational environments, where speech is often unstructured and contains\ndisfluencies such as pauses, interruptions, and diverse accents. In this study,\nwe introduce a multilingual conversational dataset, derived from TalkBank,\nconsisting of unstructured phone conversation between adults. Our results show\na significant performance drop across various state-of-the-art ASR models when\ntested in conversational settings. Furthermore, we observe a correlation\nbetween Word Error Rate and the presence of speech disfluencies, highlighting\nthe critical need for more realistic, conversational ASR benchmarks.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12042v1) |\n\n", "role": "user", "name": "Executor"}, {"content": "Read the above conversation.

However, current methods often require hundreds to\nthousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual\nobservations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual\nrepresentations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or\ntrained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present\nDynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual\nrepresentations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a\nlatent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of\nimage embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without\naugmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.\nImportantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet\ndatasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real\nenvironments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly\nimprove downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised\nlearning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo\nhold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,\nand nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and\nmeasure its impact on downstream policy performance.

Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,\nwhich enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions\ninto different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to\ngenerate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning\nwith human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary\nPosition Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional\ninformation across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for\nprocessing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception\ncapabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL\ninvestigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By\nscaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the\namount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive\nperformance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to\nleading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal\nbenchmarks, outperforming other generalist models.

BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses\nand 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance\nof deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to\nintegrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and\nperformance. However, widely-used C++-based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,\ng$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries\nlike PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of\ndebugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we\nintroduce an eager-mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,\nproviding PyTorch-compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach\nincludes GPU-accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for\n2nd-order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear\nsolvers.

Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby\npeople can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene-aware social\ntransformer model (SAST) to forecast long-term (10s) human motion motion.\nUnlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely\nvarying numbers of people and objects in a scene.

Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon |   Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a\nperfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from\nfundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\\mu$-distortion) to late-time\nbaryonic feedback processes (y-distortion). While the y-distortion can be\ndetected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the\n$\\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude\nsmaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a\nserious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\\mu$\narises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the\nprimordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \\approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here,\nwe present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly\ndetecting $\\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but\nwith an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we\noptimize the instrument's configuration to target $\\mu$ while robustly\nmarginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike\nFourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their\nindividual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing\nsignificant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the\n$\\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\\mu$-distortion at $\\approx 5\\sigma$ (10$\\sigma$)\nassuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission\nduration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized\nconfiguration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular\nresolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally\nmeasure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic\ncorrection at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total\nthermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12188v1) |\n| Exoplanet accretion monitoring spectroscopic survey (ENTROPY) I.\n  Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary-mass\n  object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C.

We obtained the first high-resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target\nwith VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near-UV to visible wavelengths (3200-6800\nAA). We report resolved H3-H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.\nBased on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+-1\nkm/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR\nexcess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of\nthe parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+-63 K and radius to 1.5+-0.1\nRj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet-surface shock model\nimplies a pre-shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,-40) km/s and a pre-shock\ndensity of log(n0/cm^-3)=14(+0,-5). Pre-shock velocity points to a mass of\n6(+8,-4) Mj for the target.

Xu |   The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our\nlocal solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions\nit exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong\ndynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).\nConsequently, it is likely that there are large-scale physical structures\nwithin the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we\npresent new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\n(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a\nmulti-wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the\nM0.8$-$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring-like morphology. We\nestimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring to be 79\"\nand 154\", respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre\ndistance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $> 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, a\nmass of $\\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\\odot$, and an expansion speed of $\\sim$ 20 km\ns$^{-1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($> 10^{51}$ erg) and\nmomentum ($> 10^7$ M$_\\odot$ km s$^{-1}$). We discuss several possible causes\nfor the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback\nand large-scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the\nM0.8$-$0.2 ring is a single high-energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain\nthe observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have\ntaken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which\nwe now see as the M0.8$-$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an\nextreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12185v1) |\n| To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic\n  reasoning | Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett |   Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting\nreasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of\ntasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted\na quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own\nevaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives\nstrong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with\nmuch smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the\nanswer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the\nquestion or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic\noperations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of\nCoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing\nagainst tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic\nexecution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our\nresults indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance\nwhile saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond\nprompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation\nacross the whole range of LLM applications.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183v1) |\n| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs | Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T.

Due to the implementation challenges\nassociated with directly training long-context models, many methods have been\nproposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to\ndifferences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these\napproaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long-context\nperformance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a\ncontrolled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation,\nutilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several\ninsights into long-context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of\nperplexity as a general-purpose performance indicator even in longer-context\ntasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods\nsystematically underperform across long-context tasks.

Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate\ninformation that conflicts with real-world facts, and their persuasive style\ncan make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result,\nend-users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with\nthe accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all\noutputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore\nsupervised finetuning on uncertainty-augmented predictions as a method to\ndevelop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty.\nSpecifically, we measure the calibration of pre-trained models and then\nfine-tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of\nuncertainty. Through experiments on various question-answering datasets, we\ndemonstrate that LLMs are well-calibrated in assessing their predictions, and\nsupervised finetuning based on the model's own confidence leads to\nwell-calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single-claim\nanswers.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12180v1) |\n| Computational Dynamical Systems | Jordan Cotler, Semon Rezchikov |   We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite-dimensional\ndynamical systems.

Subsequently, we\nshow that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable\none-dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and\nmoreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt.\nMore broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one 'machine' to simulate\nanother, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low-complexity 'encoders' and\n'decoders' to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system\nbeing simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical\nsystem leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity\ntheory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12179v1) |\n| Poisson approximate likelihood compared to the particle filter | Yize Hao, Aaron A. Abkemeier, Edward L. Ionides |   Filtering algorithms are fundamental for inference on partially observed\nstochastic dynamic systems, since they provide access to the likelihood\nfunction and hence enable likelihood-based or Bayesian inference. A novel\nPoisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.\n(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering\na fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of\npartially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL\nis the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large\nimprovement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,\nbased on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.\n(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should\nuse PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence\nalso reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a\nshortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that\nthe comparison of log-likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al. (2023) is\nflawed because their PAL calculations were carried out using a dataset scaled\ndifferently from the previous study. If PAL and the particle filter are applied\nto the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears. On simulations\nwhere the model is correctly specified, the particle filter outperforms PAL.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12173v1) |\n| You Only Read Once (YORO): Learning to Internalize Database Knowledge\n  for Text-to-SQL | Hideo Kobayashi, Wuwei Lan, Peng Shi, Shuaichen Chang, Jiang Guo, Henghui Zhu, Zhiguo Wang, Patrick Ng |   While significant progress has been made on the text-to-SQL task, recent\nsolutions repeatedly encode the same database schema for every question,\nresulting in unnecessary high inference cost and often overlooking crucial\ndatabase knowledge. To address these issues, we propose You Only Read Once\n(YORO), a novel paradigm that directly internalizes database knowledge into the\nparametric knowledge of a text-to-SQL model during training and eliminates the\nneed for schema encoding during inference. YORO significantly reduces the input\ntoken length by 66%-98%. Despite its shorter inputs, our empirical results\ndemonstrate YORO's competitive performances with traditional systems on three\nbenchmarks as well as its significant outperformance on large databases.\nFurthermore, YORO excels in handling questions with challenging value\nretrievals such as abbreviation.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12172v1) |\n| Ergodic properties of infinite extension of symmetric interval exchange\n  transformations | Przemys\u0142aw Berk, Frank Trujillo, Hao Wu |   We prove that skew products with the cocycle given by the function\n$f(x)=a(x-1/2)$ with $a\\neq 0$ are ergodic for every ergodic symmetric IET in\nthe base, thus giving the full characterization of ergodic extensions in this\nfamily. Moreover, we prove that under an additional natural assumption of\nunique ergodicity on the IET, we can replace $f$ with any differentiable\nfunction with a non-zero sum of jumps. Finally, by considering weakly mixing\nIETs instead of just ergodic, we show that the skew products with cocycle given\nby $f$ have infinite ergodic index.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12168v1) |\n| multiPI-TransBTS: A Multi-Path Learning Framework for Brain Tumor Image\n  Segmentation Based on Multi-Physical Information | Hongjun Zhu, Jiaohang Huang, Kuo Chen, Xuehui Ying, Ying Qian |   Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis,\ntreatment planning, and monitoring the progression of brain tumors. However,\ndue to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across\ndifferent MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In\nthis study, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework, multiPI-TransBTS,\nwhich integrates multi-physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.\nThe model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi-modal\nimaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor\ncharacteristics. The multiPI-TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an\nAdaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi-source, multi-scale feature\ndecoder. The encoder incorporates a multi-branch architecture to separately\nextract modality-specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module\nfuses information from multiple sources using channel-wise and element-wise\nattention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both\ncommon and task-specific features through a Task-Specific Feature Introduction\n(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),\nTumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on\nthe BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nmultiPI-TransBTS over the state-of-the-art methods. The model consistently\nachieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,\nhighlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results\nalso indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision\nand recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a\nsignificant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving\nclinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12167v1) |\n| Synchrotron self-Compton in a radiative-adiabatic fireball scenario:\n  Modelling the multiwavelength observations in some Fermi/LAT bursts | Nissim Fraija, P. Veres, B. Betancourt Kamenetskaia, A. Galvan-Gamez, M. G. Dainotti, Simone Dichiara, R. L. Becerra |   Energetic GeV photons expected from the closest and the most energetic\nGamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provide an unique opportunity to study the\nvery-high-energy emission as well as the possible correlations with lower\nenergy bands in realistic GRB afterglow models. In the standard GRB afterglow\nmodel, the relativistic homogeneous shock is usually considered to be fully\nadiabatic, however, it could be partially radiative. Based on the external\nforward-shock scenario in both stellar wind and constant-density medium. We\npresent a radiative-adiabatic analytical model of the synchrotron self-Compton\n(SSC) and synchrotron processes considering an electron energy distribution\nwith a power-law index of 1 < p < 2 and 2 $\\leq$ p. We show that the SSC\nscenario plays a relevant role in the radiative parameter $\\epsilon$, leading\nto a prolonged evolution during the slow cooling regime. In a particular case,\nwe derive the Fermi/LAT light curves together with the photons with energies\n$\\geq$ 100 MeV in a sample of nine bursts from the second Fermi/LAT GRB catalog\nthat exhibited temporal and spectral indices with $\\geq$ 1.5 and $\\approx$ 2,\nrespectively. These events can hardly be described with closure relations of\nthe standard synchrotron afterglow model, and also exhibit energetic photons\nabove the synchrotron limit. We have modeled the multi-wavelength observations\nof our sample to constrain the microphysical parameters, the circumburst\ndensity, the bulk Lorentz factor and the mechanism responsible for explaining\nthe energetic GeV photons.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12166v1) |\n| Blind Deconvolution on Graphs: Exact and Stable Recovery | Chang Ye, Gonzalo Mateos |   We study a blind deconvolution problem on graphs, which arises in the context\nof localizing a few sources that diffuse over networks. While the observations\nare bilinear functions of the unknown graph filter coefficients and sparse\ninput signals, a mild requirement on invertibility of the diffusion filter\nenables an efficient convex relaxation leading to a linear programming\nformulation that can be tackled with off-the-shelf solvers. Under the\nBernoulli-Gaussian model for the inputs, we derive sufficient exact recovery\nconditions in the noise-free setting. A stable recovery result is then\nestablished, ensuring the estimation error remains manageable even when the\nobservations are corrupted by a small amount of noise. Numerical tests with\nsynthetic and real-world network data illustrate the merits of the proposed\nalgorithm, its robustness to noise as well as the benefits of leveraging\nmultiple signals to aid the (blind) localization of sources of diffusion. At a\nfundamental level, the results presented here broaden the scope of classical\nblind deconvolution of (spatio-)temporal signals to irregular graph domains.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12164v1) |\n| Generalized compression and compressive search of large datasets | Morgan E. Prior, Thomas Howard III, Emily Light, Najib Ishaq, Noah M. Daniels |   The Big Data explosion has necessitated the development of search algorithms\nthat scale sub-linearly in time and memory.\n  While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently,\nfew algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain-specific.\n  We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to\nperform $k$-NN and $\\rho$-NN search on compressed data while only decompressing\na small, relevant, portion of the data.\n  panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low-dimensional\nstructure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.\n  panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between\ntwo points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in\nterms of the other.\n  This property holds for many widely-used distance functions, e.g. string edit\ndistances (Levenshtein, Needleman-Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures\n(Jaccard, Dice, etc.).\n  We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic,\nand set data.\n  We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the\ncompressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.\n  panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering\nsub-linear time performance for $k$-NN and $\\rho$-NN search.\n  We conclude that panCAKES is an efficient, general-purpose algorithm for\nexact compressive search on large datasets that obey the manifold hypothesis.\n  We provide an open-source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming\nlanguage.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12161v1) |\n| WeHelp: A Shared Autonomy System for Wheelchair Users | Abulikemu Abuduweili, Alice Wu, Tianhao Wei, Weiye Zhao |   There is a large population of wheelchair users. Most of the wheelchair users\nneed help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs\nare not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this\nproject, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair\nusers. A robot with a WeHelp system has three modes, following mode, remote\ncontrol mode and tele-operation mode. In the following mode, the robot follows\nthe wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can\nask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the\nwheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech\nrecognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode.\nIn the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy\nstick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs,\nsuch as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high\nshelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant\ntakes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks\nfor their needs. Our evaluation shows that the pipeline is useful and practical\nfor wheelchair users.

These IFSs\nexhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are\ntopologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the\nBlonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave\nsuperconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients\nincluding thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and\nexamine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage\nand temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of\n$d$-wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the\nnormal-superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric\nresponse. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in\nSeebeck coefficient ($\\sim 200\\,\\mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($\\sim 3.5$) due to the\ngeneration of the IFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for\ndevice applications.

Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker\nidentity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a NeRF-based network. Since we train our network on\nmonocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn\ndisentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio\nfeatures in a self-supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects.\nBy incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned\naudio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle\nmotion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer-based architecture\nthat learns expression features, capturing long-range facial expressions and\ndisentangling them from the speech-specific mouth movements. Through\nquantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can\nsynthesize high-fidelity talking face videos, achieving state-of-the-art facial\nexpression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12156v1) |\n| Autopet III challenge: Incorporating anatomical knowledge into nnUNet\n  for lesion segmentation in PET/CT | Hamza Kalisch, Fabian H\u00f6rst, Ken Herrmann, Jens Kleesiek, Constantin Seibold |   Lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging is essential for precise tumor\ncharacterization, which supports personalized treatment planning and enhances\ndiagnostic precision in oncology. However, accurate manual segmentation of\nlesions is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. Given the\nrising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods,\nparticularly deep-learning-based approaches, have become increasingly more\nrelevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation\nof tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting,\naddressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable\nsolutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET\nchallenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers\n(FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers. To this extent, we developed a\nclassifier that identifies the tracer of the given PET/CT based on the Maximum\nIntensity Projection of the PET scan. We trained two individual\nnnUNet-ensembles for each tracer where anatomical labels are included as a\nmulti-label task to enhance the model's performance.

However, a\nrobot's ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if\nnaively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach-avoid\ndynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a\nsafety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human's behavior\nas goal-driven but conditioned on the robot's plan, enabling us to capture\ninfluence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical\nand belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in\nhuman behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE\n(Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high-dimensional\n(39-D) simulated human-robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline\ngame-theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust\nbaseline that treats the human as a worst-case adversary, a safety controller\nthat does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy-function-based\nsafety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage\nthe influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing\nthe robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate\nduring task execution.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12153v1) |\n| Decoding Style: Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Image-Guided Outfit\n  Recommendation with Preference | Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan |   Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding\nboth fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper\npresents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their \"black box\" and static\nnature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item\nvisual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a\nMultimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style\nand color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis\nfor personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the\nopen-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability\nto recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative\nexamples is employed to enhance the LLM's decision-making process. This creates\na self-enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in\nline with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore\ndataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill-in-the-blank,\nand complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework's\nability to generate stylish, trend-aligned outfit suggestions, continuously\nimproving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our\nproposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more\ncohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the\nproposed framework's potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate\nsuggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit\ngeneration.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12150v1) |\n| Mechanical Wannier-Stark Ladder of Diamond Spin-Mechanical Lamb Wave\n  Resonators | Philip Andrango, Hailin Wang |   We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier-Stark ladders of\ndiamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with\nultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin\nproperties. Three nearest-neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric\nconfigurations and a large range of coupling rates have been explored for the\nrealization of Wannier-Stark ladders of LWRs, potentially enabling long-range\nconnectivity between spin qubits through their interactions with mechanical\nvibrations.

While these improve performance, they often reach a\nsaturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated\nfeedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key\nchallenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can\nover-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and\naddress errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to\nidentify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding\nhow many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too\nsoon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose\nMAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty\nas easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard\nones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error\nlocalization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores.\nMoreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with\nthree agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on\nstep-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure\nsufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating\nfurther rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5\nand show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of\nMAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by\n4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with\nbaselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our\nablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe's RMs and multi-agent\ncommunication.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147v1) |\n| Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka |   Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string\nprocessing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into\nblocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence\nof a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another\noccurrence earlier in $T$. Due to numerous applications, LZ77 factorization is\none of the most studied problems on strings. In the 47 years since its\ninception, several algorithms were developed for different models of\ncomputation, including parallel, GPU, external-memory, and quantum. Remarkably,\nhowever, the complexity of the most basic variant is still not settled: All\nexisting algorithms in the RAM model run in $\\Omega(n)$ time, which is a\n$\\Theta(\\log n)$ factor away from the lower bound of $\\Omega(n/\\log n)$\n(following from the necessity to read the input, which takes $\\Theta(n/\\log n)$\nspace for $T\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}$).\n  We present the first $o(n)$-time algorithm for LZ77 factorization, breaking\nthe linear-time barrier present for nearly 50 years. For $T\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}$, our\nalgorithm runs in $\\mathcal{O}(n/\\sqrt{\\log n})=o(n)$ time and uses the optimal\n$\\mathcal{O}(n/\\log n)$ working space. Our algorithm generalizes to\n$\\Sigma=[0..\\sigma)$, where $\\sigma=n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The runtime and\nworking space then become $\\mathcal{O}((n\\log\\sigma)/\\sqrt{\\log n})$ and\n$\\mathcal{O}(n/\\log_{\\sigma} n)$. To obtain our algorithm, we prove a more\ngeneral result: For any constant $\\epsilon\\in(0,1)$ and $T\\in[0..\\sigma)^{n}$,\nin $\\mathcal{O}((n\\log\\sigma)/\\sqrt{\\log n})$ time and using\n$\\mathcal{O}(n/\\log_{\\sigma}n)$ space, we can construct an\n$\\mathcal{O}(n/\\log_{\\sigma}n)$-size index that, given any $P=T[j..j+\\ell)$\n(represented as $(j,\\ell)$), computes the leftmost occurrence of $P$ in $T$ in\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log^{\\epsilon}n)$ time.

To better pursue the scaling power of MoE, we introduce GRIN\n(GRadient-INformed MoE training), which incorporates sparse gradient estimation\nfor expert routing and configures model parallelism to avoid token dropping.\nApplying GRIN to autoregressive language modeling, we develop a top-2\n16$\\times$3.8B MoE model. Our model, with only 6.6B activated parameters,\noutperforms a 7B dense model and matches the performance of a 14B dense model\ntrained on the same data. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks\ndemonstrate the potential of GRIN to significantly enhance MoE efficacy,\nachieving 79.4 on MMLU, 83.7 on HellaSwag, 74.4 on HumanEval, and 58.9 on MATH.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12136v1) |\n| BERT-VBD: Vietnamese Multi-Document Summarization Framework | Tuan-Cuong Vuong, Trang Mai Xuan, Thien Van Luong |   In tackling the challenge of Multi-Document Summarization (MDS), numerous\nmethods have been proposed, spanning both extractive and abstractive\nsummarization techniques. However, each approach has its own limitations,\nmaking it less effective to rely solely on either one. An emerging and\npromising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractive\nsummarization methods. Despite the plethora of studies in this domain, research\non the combined methodology remains scarce, particularly in the context of\nVietnamese language processing. This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDS\nframework leveraging a two-component pipeline architecture that integrates\nextractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs an\nextractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This is\nachieved by a modification of the pre-trained BERT network, which derives\nsemantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet network\nstructures. The second component utilizes the VBD-LLaMA2-7B-50b model for\nabstractive summarization, ultimately generating the final summary document.\nOur proposed framework demonstrates a positive performance, attaining ROUGE-2\nscores of 39.6% on the VN-MDS dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art\nbaselines.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12134v1) |\n| Einstein-dilaton-four-Maxwell Holographic Anisotropic Models | Irina Ya. Aref'eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov |   In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the\nfive-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell models has played a crucial role.\nTypically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while\nadditional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A\nmore general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field\nrepresents spatial longitudinal-transverse anisotropy, while the third and\nfourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We\nconsider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero\ntemperature and five functions at non-zero temperature. Maxwell field related\nto the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,\nwhereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.\nWe demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of\nthe seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations -- either the\ndilaton or the vector potential equation -- follows from the Einstein equations\nand the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi\nidentity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress-energy\ntensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is\nprovided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to\nthree Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis\nshows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein\nequations and the equation for the vector potential\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12131v1) |\n| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components\n  for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco-Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram |   Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data\ntogether with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal\ncomponents used. It is therefore important to determine the number of\nsignificant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a\nvariational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for\nestimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of\nsamples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This\neliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of\nprincipal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.\nThis framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows\nand columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),\nand with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data\nwith arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as\ncultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our\nmethod on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may\nunderestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the\nsynthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical\ndataset. These results suggest that it is broadly applicable across the life\nsciences.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12129v1) |\n| Linguini: A benchmark for language-agnostic linguistic reasoning | Eduardo S\u00e1nchez, Belen Alastruey, Christophe Ropers, Pontus Stenetorp, Mikel Artetxe, Marta R. Costa-juss\u00e0 |   We propose a new benchmark to measure a language model's linguistic reasoning\nskills without relying on pre-existing language-specific knowledge. The test\ncovers 894 questions grouped in 160 problems across 75 (mostly) extremely\nlow-resource languages, extracted from the International Linguistic Olympiad\ncorpus. To attain high accuracy on this benchmark, models don't need previous\nknowledge of the tested language, as all the information needed to solve the\nlinguistic puzzle is presented in the context. We find that, while all analyzed\nmodels rank below 25% accuracy, there is a significant gap between open and\nclosed models, with the best-performing proprietary model at 24.05% and the\nbest-performing open model at 8.84%.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12126v1) |\n| From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the\n  primordial black hole reheating scenario | Guillem Dom\u00e8nech, Jan Tr\u00e4nkle |   We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs\noriginate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight\nPBHs with masses $M\\lesssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat\nit via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate\nwhether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH\nreheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the\ninitial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer\nfunctions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and\nisocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation\nof state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH\ndominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the\nspectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive\nto $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density\nfluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance\nas a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\nobservations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the\ninitial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we\nfind that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several\nfuture GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas,\nespecially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any\nearly matter-dominated universe scenario.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12125v1) |\n| Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules | Anqi Zhang, Wilson S. Geisler |   Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We\ninvestigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented\ndisplays having well-separated potential target-object locations. Performance\nwas compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption\nthat the information from the different potential target locations is\nstatistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than\noptimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the\nimplausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show\nthat three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical\nresults. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near\noptimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the\ncentral potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise\ncauses search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These\nfindings have far-reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks\nand other identification tasks in humans and other animals.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12124v1) |\n| Far-from-equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann\n  approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows\n  $v_n$ | Vincenzo Nugara, Vincenzo Greco, Salvatore Plumari |   We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal\nsystem in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution\nfunction and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system\nsizes $R$ and interaction strength $\\eta/s$ and identify universality classes\nbased upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each\nof this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $\\hat\n\\gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results\nhighlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum\nmoments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to\na 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of\ndifferent sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a\nsimilar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse\nflow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system\nsize and $\\eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and\ntheir response functions, along with the impact of the $\\eta/s$ and the system\ntransverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in\nmomentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow\n$v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of\nlarge opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems\nevolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play\nin this process.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12123v1) |\n| Qwen2.5-Math Technical Report: Toward Mathematical Expert Model via\n  Self-Improvement | An Yang, Beichen Zhang, Binyuan Hui, Bofei Gao, Bowen Yu, Chengpeng Li, Dayiheng Liu, Jianhong Tu, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin, Keming Lu, Mingfeng Xue, Runji Lin, Tianyu Liu, Xingzhang Ren, Zhenru Zhang |   In this report, we present a series of math-specific large language models:\nQwen2.5-Math and Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct-1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the\nQwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self-improvement\nthroughout the entire pipeline, from pre-training and post-training to\ninference: (1) During the pre-training phase, Qwen2-Math-Instruct is utilized\nto generate large-scale, high-quality mathematical data. (2) In the\npost-training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive\nsampling from Qwen2-Math-Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative\nevolution of data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model,\nit's possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the\nnext round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the\nultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct.\n(3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling,\noptimizing the model's performance.\n  Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced\nmathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and\nTool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics\ndatasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and\nAIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math\ncompetition problems.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12122v1) |\n| Computing the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two-Dimensional\n  Strongly-Correlated Systems | Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn |   We show that the two-dimensional $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time-reversal\ninvariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary-condition\ndependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non-interacting and\nstrongly-correlated insulators. By introducing a family of quasi-single\nparticle states associated to the many-body ground state of an insulator, we\nshow that the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant can be expressed as the integral of a\ncertain Berry connection over half the space of boundary conditions, providing\nan alternative expression to the formulations that appear in [Lee et al., Phys.\nRev.

We show the equivalence of the\ndifferent many-body formulations of the invariant, and show how they reduce to\nknown band-theoretic results for Slater determinant ground states. Finally, we\napply our results to analytically calculate the invariant for the Kane-Mele\nmodel with nonlocal (orbital) Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) interactions. This\nrigorously establishes the topological nontriviality of the Kane-Mele model\nwith HK interactions, and represents one of the few exact calculations of the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a strongly-interacting system.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12120v1) |\n| Weak Lensing analysis of Abell 2390 using short exposures | A.

Sembroski |   We present a weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 2390 at z =\n0.23 using second moment shape measurements made in 411 short 60s exposures.\nThe exposures are obtained in three broadband photometric filters (g, r, i)\nusing WIYN-ODI. Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a\nmoment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching\nalgorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The\nmeasurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight\nto obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim\nsimulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find\nthe mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We\nalso find the E-Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic\nstructures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical\nand X-Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to\nmap large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of\nthe cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the\npeaks are similar to X-Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster\nand show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12119v1) |\n| Low Frame-rate Speech Codec: a Codec Designed for Fast High-quality\n  Speech LLM Training and Inference | Edresson Casanova, Ryan Langman, Paarth Neekhara, Shehzeen Hussain, Jason Li, Subhankar Ghosh, Ante Juki\u0107, Sang-gil Lee |   Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing\nthrough audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the\napplication of language modeling techniques to audio data. However, audio\ncodecs often operate at high frame rates, resulting in slow training and\ninference, especially for autoregressive models. To address this challenge, we\npresent the Low Frame-rate Speech Codec (LFSC): a neural audio codec that\nleverages finite scalar quantization and adversarial training with large speech\nlanguage models to achieve high-quality audio compression with a 1.89 kbps\nbitrate and 21.5 frames per second.

Kothari |   Machine Learning (ML) research has increased substantially in recent years,\ndue to the success of predictive modeling across diverse application domains.\nHowever, well-known barriers exist when attempting to deploy ML models in\nhigh-stakes, clinical settings, including lack of model transparency (or the\ninability to audit the inference process), large training data requirements\nwith siloed data sources, and complicated metrics for measuring model utility.\nIn this work, we show empirically that including stronger baseline models in\nhealthcare ML evaluations has important downstream effects that aid\npractitioners in addressing these challenges. Through a series of case studies,\nwe find that the common practice of omitting baselines or comparing against a\nweak baseline model (e.g. a linear model with no optimization) obscures the\nvalue of ML methods proposed in the research literature. Using these insights,\nwe propose some best practices that will enable practitioners to more\neffectively study and deploy ML models in clinical settings.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12116v1) |\n| Revisiting Dark Photon Constraints from CMB Spectral Distortions | Jens Chluba, Bryce Cyr, Matthew C. Johnson |   Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide\nstringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post-BBN (Big\nBang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models\nwith COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.\nHere, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark\nphoton conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous\nworks only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the\nchange to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon\ndistortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the\ndistortion has an opposite sign and a $\\simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We\nfurthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover\nthe redshift range $\\simeq 2\\times 10^6-4\\times 10^7$ between the $\\mu$-era and\nthe end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints\nfor dark photon masses in the range $10^{-4}\\,{\\rm eV}\\lesssim m_{\\rm\ndp}\\lesssim 10^{-3}\\,{\\rm eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We\ndemonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon\nto dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $\\mu$-type distortion\nindependent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study\ndark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with\nCMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12115v1) |\n| Bi-objective trail-planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous\n  environment | Cory M. Simon, Jeffrey Richley, Lucas Overbey, Darleen Perez-Lavin |   Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in\nresource delivery, patrolling, information-gathering, agriculture, forest fire\nfighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and\nsearch-and-rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments -- with e.g.\nrough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or\ncapturing robots -- should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of\nrisks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should\ntake the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the\nteam-level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward\nfrom visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider\nbi-objective trail-planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a\nhazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed\ngraph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of\nsurvival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a\nrobot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for\nthe Pareto-optimal robot-team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team\nobjectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive\nthe mission. A human decision-maker can then select trail plans that balance,\naccording to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony\noptimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto-optimal set of\nrobot team trail plans.

We demonstrate that strategic\ndata reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing\nbandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies\nMinimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource-constrained\nenvironments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient\npractices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and\noverprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for\noptimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data\nrepresentation. An experimental methodology demonstrates effective acoustic\ndata characterization after downsampling, quantization, and truncation to\nsimulate reduced-fidelity sensors and network and storage constraints; results\nshows that performance can be maintained up to 95\\% with sample rates reduced\nby 75\\% and bit depths and clip length reduced by 50\\% which translates into\nsubstantial cost and resource reduction. These findings have implications on\nthe design and development of constrained systems.

Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a\npowerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,\ncomplex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in\nperformance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and\nits innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer\nknowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact\nand efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application\nacross various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and\nhistorical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are\nhighlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational\nefficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical\ndeployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of\nKD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the\nbreadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case\nstudies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,\nsuch as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review\ndiscusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical\nconstraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive\noverview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS. Through this\norganization, the paper not only elucidates the current state of research in KD\nbut also sets the stage for future research opportunities, thereby contributing\nsignificantly to both academic research and real-world applications.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12111v1) |\n| It depends: Varieties of defining growth dependence | Anja Janischewski, Katharina Bohnenberger, Matthias Kranke, Tobias Vogel, Riwan Driouich, Tobias Froese, Stefanie Gerold, Raphael Kaufmann, Lorenz Key\u00dfer, Jannis Niethammer, Christopher Olk, Matthias Schmelzer, Asl\u0131 Y\u00fcr\u00fck, Steffen Lange |   Many socio-economic systems require positive economic growth rates to\nfunction properly. Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing\nevidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,\nthese growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,\nmore and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth-dependent systems\nand develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of\n'growth dependence' still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,\nwhich impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article\nproposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the\nconcept of 'growth dependence' across socio-economic systems. We provide a\ngeneral definition consisting of four components that can be specified for\ndifferent empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of\nmeasurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions\nor properties of the system under investigation. According to our general\ndefinition, a socio-economic system is growth-dependent if it requires a\nlong-term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to\nmaintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen\nnormative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to\nthree areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:\nemployment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies\ndemonstrate that whether or not a system is growth-dependent hinges not only on\nthe empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of\nthe concept of growth dependence.

Computer-assisted Surgery systems\nhave played a crucial role in improving the precision and safety of ESD\nprocedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognition\nof surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesion\ncharacteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real-time\nsurgical phase recognition algorithms. Existing surgical phase recognition\nalgorithms struggle to efficiently capture temporal contexts in video-based\nscenarios, leading to insufficient performance. To address these issues, we\npropose SPRMamba, a novel Mamba-based framework for ESD surgical phase\nrecognition. SPRMamba leverages the strengths of Mamba for long-term temporal\nmodeling while introducing the Scaled Residual TranMamba block to enhance the\ncapture of fine-grained details, overcoming the limitations of traditional\ntemporal models like Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformers.\nMoreover, a Temporal Sample Strategy is introduced to accelerate the\nprocessing, which is essential for real-time phase recognition in clinical\nsettings. Extensive testing on the ESD385 dataset and the cholecystectomy\nCholec80 dataset demonstrates that SPRMamba surpasses existing state-of-the-art\nmethods and exhibits greater robustness across various surgical phase\nrecognition tasks.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12108v1) |\n| Who's the GOAT?

The traditional approach to federated\nlearning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it\nfails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data.\nThis results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting\nthe equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a\nmethodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,\nwe propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the\nlocal training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred\noptimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state-of-the-art\nmethods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed\ndistribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10-LT and\nCIFAR-100-LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of\nmodel performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long-tailed\ndistribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12105v1) |\n| Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error\n  Detection | Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia |   Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications. Doing\nso requires overcoming the noise present on today's hardware. The quantum\napproximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling\nup due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup\nover state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems. However,\nachieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require\nfault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant\nimplementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection\ncode. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the\nalgorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with\nup to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we\npropose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance, and use it\nto characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance\nto future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our\nmodel can be used to determine necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform\nGoemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware. Our results demonstrate the\nlargest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially\nfault-tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date,\npaving the way towards solving real-world applications with quantum computers.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12104v1) |\n| Cyclicity Analysis of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process | Vivek Kaushik |   In this thesis, we consider an $N$-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)\nprocess satisfying the linear stochastic differential equation $d\\mathbf x(t) =\n- \\mathbf B\\mathbf x(t) dt + \\boldsymbol \\Sigma d \\mathbf w(t).$ Here, $\\mathbf\nB$ is a fixed $N \\times N$ circulant friction matrix whose eigenvalues have\npositive real parts, $\\boldsymbol \\Sigma$ is a fixed $N \\times M$ matrix. We\nconsider a signal propagation model governed by this OU process. In this model,\nan underlying signal propagates throughout a network consisting of $N$ linked\nsensors located in space. We interpret the $n$-th component of the OU process\nas the measurement of the propagating effect made by the $n$-th sensor. The\nmatrix $\\mathbf B$ represents the sensor network structure: if $\\mathbf B$ has\nfirst row $(b_1 \\ , \\ \\dots \\ , \\ b_N),$ where $b_1>0$ and $b_2 \\ , \\ \\dots \\\n,\\ b_N \\le 0,$ then the magnitude of $b_p$ quantifies how receptive the $n$-th\nsensor is to activity within the $(n+p-1)$-th sensor. Finally, the $(m,n)$-th\nentry of the matrix $\\mathbf D = \\frac{\\boldsymbol \\Sigma \\boldsymbol\n\\Sigma^\\text T}{2}$ is the covariance of the component noises injected into the\n$m$-th and $n$-th sensors. For different choices of $\\mathbf B$ and\n$\\boldsymbol \\Sigma,$ we investigate whether Cyclicity Analysis enables us to\nrecover the structure of network. Roughly speaking, Cyclicity Analysis studies\nthe lead-lag dynamics pertaining to the components of a multivariate signal. We\nspecifically consider an $N \\times N$ skew-symmetric matrix $\\mathbf Q,$ known\nas the lead matrix, in which the sign of its $(m,n)$-th entry captures the\nlead-lag relationship between the $m$-th and $n$-th component OU processes.

Recently, this\ncuriosity has motivated the fMRI-to-image reconstruction task; given the fMRI\ndata from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual\nstimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent\nDiffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex\nvisual stimuli such as high-resolution natural images from vision datasets.\nDespite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often\nlack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.\nConsequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere\nvisuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs\neffectively incorporate multi-modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,\nand image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image\ngenerations. Specifically, inspired by the two-streams hypothesis suggesting\nthat perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain\nregions, our framework, Brain-Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain\nregions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from\nsemantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information\nregions, Brain-Streams provides accurate multi-modal guidance to LDMs. We\nvalidate the reconstruction ability of Brain-Streams both quantitatively and\nqualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI\ndata.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12099v1) |\n| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal\n  execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huy\u00ean Pham |   Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and\nconstraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity\nmarkets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general\npropagator model under linear functional inequality constraints. The optimal\ncontrol is given explicitly in terms of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers\nand their conditional expectations, as a solution to a linear stochastic\nFredholm equation. We propose a stochastic version of the Uzawa algorithm on\nthe dual problem to construct the stochastic Lagrange multipliers numerically\nvia a stochastic projected gradient ascent, combined with a least-squares Monte\nCarlo regression step to approximate their conditional expectations. We\nillustrate our findings on two different practical applications with stochastic\nsignals: (i) an optimal execution problem with an exponential or a power law\ndecaying transient impact, with either a `no-shorting' constraint in the\npresence of a `sell' signal, a `no-buying' constraint in the presence of a\n`buy' signal or a stochastic `stop-trading' constraint whenever the exogenous\nprice drops below a specified reference level; (ii) a battery storage problem\nwith instantaneous operating costs, seasonal signals and fixed constraints on\nboth the charging power and the load capacity of the battery.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12098v1) |\n| Skill matching at scale: freelancer-project alignment for efficient\n  multilingual candidate retrieval | Warren Jouanneau, Marc Palyart, Emma Jouffroy |   Finding the perfect match between a job proposal and a set of freelancers is\nnot an easy task to perform at scale, especially in multiple languages.

The task of\nnext-best-view (NBV) planning is to infer the pose of the next viewpoint based\non the current data, and gradually realize the complete three-dimensional\nreconstruction. Many existing algorithms, however, suffer a large computational\nburden due to the use of ray-casting. To address this, this paper proposes a\nprojection-based NBV planning framework. It can select the next best view at an\nextremely fast speed while ensuring the complete scanning of the object.\nSpecifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into\nellipsoids based on the voxel structure.Then, the next best view is selected\nfrom the candidate views using a projection-based viewpoint quality evaluation\nfunction in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy. This process\nreplaces the ray-casting in voxel structures, significantly improving the\ncomputational efficiency. Comparative experiments with other algorithms in a\nsimulation environment show that the framework proposed in this paper can\nachieve 10 times efficiency improvement on the basis of capturing roughly the\nsame coverage. The real-world experimental results also prove the efficiency\nand feasibility of the framework.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12096v1) |\n| Undersampling effects on observed periods of coronal oscillations | Daye Lim, Tom Van Doorsselaere, Valery M. Nakariakov, Dmitrii Y. Kolotkov, Yuhang Gao, David Berghmans |   Context. Recent observations of decayless transverse oscillations have shown\ntwo branches in the relationship between periods and loop lengths. One is a\nlinear relationship, interpreted as a standing mode. The other shows almost no\ncorrelation and has not yet been interpreted conclusively. Aims. We\ninvestigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless\noscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely\nfollow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations\nare standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations\nwhere the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase\nare randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal\nby considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of\ntelescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast\nFourier transform. Results. When the sampling cadence is getting closer to the\nactual oscillation period, a tendency for overestimating periods in short loops\nis enhanced. The relationship between loop lengths and periods of the sampled\nsignals shows the two branches as in the observation. Conclusions. We find that\nlong periods of decayless oscillations occurring in short loops could be the\nresult of undersampling.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12095v1) |\n| Enwrapped Perylene Bisimide Enables Room Temperature Polariton Lasing\n  and Photonic Lattices | Dominik Horneber, Johannes D\u00fcreth, Tim Schembri, Simon Betzold, Matthias Stolte, Sven H\u00f6fling, Frank W\u00fcrthner, Sebastian Klembt |   Perylene bisimides (PBIs) are organic dyes with photoluminescence quantum\nyields (PLQY) close to unity in solution and great thermal and photo-chemical\nstability. These features alongside the tunability of their solid-state packing\narrangement via chemical functionalization make this material class an\nexcellent candidate for exciton-polariton lasing at room temperature. Polariton\nlasing is well understood in III-V semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures,\nhowever, the search for emitter materials for robust and versatile room\ntemperature applications is ongoing. While e.g. perovskites and several organic\nmaterials have been identified to support polariton lasing, many of these\nmaterials lack tunability and long-term stability under ambient conditions.\nHere, we fabricate optical microcavities using a strongly enwrapped PBI\nchromophore with prevailing monomer-like absorption and emission properties in\nthe solid state. Voluminous bay-substituents prevent stacking induced\nPLQY-quenching, thereby enabling polariton lasing at room temperature.\nAdditionally, photonic confinement in single hemispheric resonators is\ndemonstrated leading to localized polaritonic modes with discrete energies, as\nwell as optical lattices revealing distinct polaritonic band-structures. Due to\nthe possibility of tunable properties by the precise control of the solid-state\npacking arrangement of PBI emitters, our results pave the way for\npolarization-dependent light-matter coupling, including topological photonic\neffects within oriented crystalline thin-film microcavity structures.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12093v1) |\n| IMRL: Integrating Visual, Physical, Temporal, and Geometric\n  Representations for Enhanced Food Acquisition | Rui Liu, Zahiruddin Mahammad, Amisha Bhaskar, Pratap Tokekar |   Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality\nof life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse\nfood items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents\nunique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric\ninformation (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g.,\ncolor, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially\nwhen foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance.\nWe employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition.\nExisting methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy\nbased on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, such\nrepresentations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse\nacquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\napproach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which\nintegrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance\nthe robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach\ncaptures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular,\nliquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and\nintroduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and\nassess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies\nbased on context, improving the robot's capability to handle diverse food\nacquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach's\nrobustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations,\nincluding zero-shot generalization to unseen settings.

Motivated by recent experiments which achieved\nunprecedented fast growth of large-size high-quality 2D crystals on liquid\nsubstrates, we uncover novel effects of liquid surfaces on microstructural\nordering. We find that substrate fluctuations generate short-ranged noise that\nspeeds up crystallization and grain growth of the overlayer, surpassing that of\nfree-standing system. Coupling to the liquid substrate fluctuations can also\nmodulate local randomness, leading to intriguing disordered structures with\nhidden spatial order, i.e., disordered hyperuniformity.

To navigate such environments,\nagents benefit from information on the various elements (e.g., buttons, text,\nor images) present. It remains unclear which element attributes have the\ngreatest impact on agent performance, especially in environments that only\nprovide a graphical representation (i.e., pixels). Here we find that the\nordering in which elements are presented to the language model is surprisingly\nimpactful--randomizing element ordering in a webpage degrades agent performance\ncomparably to removing all visible text from an agent's state representation.\nWhile a webpage provides a hierarchical ordering of elements, there is no such\nordering when parsing elements directly from pixels. Moreover, as tasks become\nmore challenging and models more sophisticated, our experiments suggest that\nthe impact of ordering increases. Finding an effective ordering is non-trivial.\nWe investigate the impact of various element ordering methods in web and\ndesktop environments. We find that dimensionality reduction provides a viable\nordering for pixel-only environments. We train a UI element detection model to\nderive elements from pixels and apply our findings to an agent\nbenchmark--OmniACT--where we only have access to pixels.

At zero temperature for baryon chemical potentials below\nthe mass of the Lambda baryon, only nucleons contribute to the quark density.\nThis is different at finite temperature, where all baryons, mesons and their\nresonances can be excited and thus add quarks to the phase space. The\nprobability density to find a quark inside a hadron is determined using the\nYukawa ansatz of the IdylliQ model of Quarkyonic Matter. We estimate separately\nthe magnitude of the various contributions of nucleons, Delta baryons, pions as\nwell as further hadrons and resonances. The uncertainty in the parametrization\nof the probability density to find a quark inside a nucleon is spanned by\nassuming that at zero temperature the transition density to Quarkyonic Matter\nis between one and three times that of nuclear matter.

Agyeman, Jinfeng Liu, Sirish L. Shah |   Efficient water management in agriculture is important for mitigating the\ngrowing freshwater scarcity crisis. Mixed-integer Model Predictive Control\n(MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex\nscheduling problems in agricultural irrigation. However, the computational\ncomplexity of mixed-integer MPC still poses a significant challenge,\nparticularly in large-scale applications. This study proposes an approach to\nenhance the computational efficiency of mixed-integer MPC-based irrigation\nschedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture\ndynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed-integer linear\nrepresentation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the\nmixed-integer MPC-based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a\nmixed-integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed-integer\nnonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global\noptimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated\nthrough comparative studies conducted on a large-scale agricultural field\nacross two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models,\nspecifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used\ntriggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU-based approach significantly\nreduces solution times -- by up to 99.5\\% -- while achieving comparable\nperformance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water\nUse Efficiency (IWUE).

Current computational methods rely on the assumption that\nthe binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible,\nas conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon\nbinding. In this work, we formulate proteins and molecules as unified\nbiotokens, and present AtomFlow, a novel deep generative model under the\nflow-matching framework for the design of ligand-binding proteins from the 2D\ntarget molecular graph alone. Operating on representative atoms of biotokens,\nAtomFlow captures the flexibility of ligands and generates ligand conformations\nand protein backbone structures iteratively.

This\nenables operation in diverse and varying refractive fluids, given only the\ncamera calibration in air. The refractive index is estimated online as a state\nvariable of a monocular visual-inertial odometry framework in an iterative\nformulation using the proposed camera model. The method was verified on data\ncollected using an underwater robot traversing inside a pool. The evaluations\ndemonstrate convergence to the ideal refractive index for water despite\nsignificant perturbations in the initialization. Simultaneously, the approach\nenables on-par visual-inertial odometry performance in refractive media without\nprior knowledge of the refractive index or requirement of medium-specific\ncamera calibration.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12074v1) |\n| Influence of dislocations in multilayer graphene stacks: A phase field\n  crystal study | K. R. Elder, Zhi-Feng Huang, T. Ala-Nissila |   In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene\nstacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a\nrecently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems\nincorporating out-of-plane deformations and parameterized to match to density\nfunctional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems. The\nspecific configuration considered consists of one monolayer containing four\n$5|7$ dislocations (i.e., two dislocation dipoles) sandwiched in between\nperfect graphene layers. The study reveals how the strain field from the\ndislocations in the defected layer leads to out-of-plane deformations that in\nturn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are\nmade for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a\ndefect-free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and\nsystem size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by\nroughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence\nacross the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height\nprofiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12073v1) |\n| PAD-FT: A Lightweight Defense for Backdoor Attacks via Data Purification\n  and Fine-Tuning | Yukai Xu, Yujie Gu, Kouichi Sakurai |   Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks,\nparticularly as recent advancements have led to increasingly subtle\nimplantation, making the defense more challenging. Existing defense mechanisms\ntypically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and\ninvolve retraining an auxiliary model or fine-tuning the entire victim model.\nHowever, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always\nfeasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and\nlightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD-FT, that does not require an\nadditional clean dataset and fine-tunes only a very small part of the model to\ndisinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a\nsimple data purification process to identify and select the most-likely clean\ndata from the poisoned training dataset. The self-purified clean dataset is\nthen used for activation clipping and fine-tuning only the last classification\nlayer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation\nclipping, and classifier fine-tuning, our mechanism PAD-FT demonstrates\nsuperior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as\nconfirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12072v1) |\n| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing\n  data in Irish sagas | P. MacCarron |   For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts\nin order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify\nsimilarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the\nsignificance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture\nrequires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and\noften impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the\nnetwork of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that\nthe top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent\nwith central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has\nbeen lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust\nto a large random removal of edges.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12071v1) |\n| The repetition threshold for ternary rich words | James D. Currie, Lucas Mol, Jarkko Peltom\u00e4ki |   In 2014, Vesti proposed the problem of determining the repetition threshold\nfor infinite rich words, i.e., for infinite words in which all factors of\nlength $n$ contain $n$ distinct nonempty palindromic factors. In 2020, Currie,\nMol, and Rampersad proved a conjecture of Baranwal and Shallit that the\nrepetition threshold for binary rich words is $2 + \\sqrt{2}/2$. In this paper,\nwe prove a structure theorem for $16/7$-power-free ternary rich words. Using\nthe structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich\nwords is $1 + 1/(3 - \\mu) \\approx 2.25876324$, where $\\mu$ is the unique real\nroot of the polynomial $x^3 - 2x^2 - 1$.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12068v1) |\n| Fitting Multilevel Factor Models | Tetiana Parshakova, Trevor Hastie, Stephen Boyd |   We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance\ngiven by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~\\cite{parshakova2023factor}. We\ndevelop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM)\nalgorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of\nthe observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and\nmaintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved\nthrough a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive\ndefinite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of an invertible PSD MLR matrix\nis also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the\nrecursive Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of\nthe inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky\nfactorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities,\nyielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement.

Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by\ntidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to\ntheir proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the\nTRAPPIST-1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In\nthis work, we present the recent implementation of the co-planar tidal torque\nand forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N-body code\nPosidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using\na tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of\neach planet by taking into account their multi-layer internal structure\ncomputed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets\nare not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state.\nPlanet-planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and\ntides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a\nresult, the sub-stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and\nlong-timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with\nperiods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12065v1) |\n| Quantum Magic and Multi-Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei | Florian Br\u00f6kemeier, S. Momme Hengstenberg, James W. T. Keeble, Caroline E. P. Robin, Federico Rocco, Martin J. Savage |   Motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the\nquantum complexity of $p$-shell and $sd$-shell nuclei. Valence-space nuclear\nshell-model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit\nregisters using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$-shell and 24\nqubits for the $sd$-shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement\n($n$-tangles) and magic (non-stabilizerness) are determined. While exact\nevaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of\nactive nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex\nnuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique\nis introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed\nnuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\\sim 8$ for some\nnuclei. Significant multi-nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$-shell,\ndominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of\nmagic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on\nthe path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion.\nThese results indicate that quantum-computing resources will accelerate\nprecision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12064v1) |\n| Post-Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a\n  massive, rotating object | Lorenzo Iorio |   The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the\ngeneral relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring\ncomponents of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are\nanalytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level. To the Newtonian\norder, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as\nwell. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation\nin space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the\nprimary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first\nto 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system\nalong an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred\nclose to the Sun's flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due\nto the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of\nmicroarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for\nthe post-Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)\nspacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of\nthe latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current\n(formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would\nbring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the\npredicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not\nchanged by any of the post--Keplerian accelerations considered. The\ncalculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any\nalternative models of gravity as well.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12063v1) |\n| Generalized Robot Learning Framework | Jiahuan Yan, Zhouyang Hong, Yu Zhao, Yu Tian, Yunxin Liu, Travis Davies, Luhui Hu |   Imitation based robot learning has recently gained significant attention in\nthe robotics field due to its theoretical potential for transferability and\ngeneralizability. However, it remains notoriously costly, both in terms of\nhardware and data collection, and deploying it in real-world environments\ndemands meticulous setup of robots and precise experimental conditions. In this\npaper, we present a low-cost robot learning framework that is both easily\nreproducible and transferable to various robots and environments. We\ndemonstrate that deployable imitation learning can be successfully applied even\nto industrial-grade robots, not just expensive collaborative robotic arms.\nFurthermore, our results show that multi-task robot learning is achievable with\nsimple network architectures and fewer demonstrations than previously thought\nnecessary. As the current evaluating method is almost subjective when it comes\nto real-world manipulation tasks, we propose Voting Positive Rate (VPR) - a\nnovel evaluation strategy that provides a more objective assessment of\nperformance. We conduct an extensive comparison of success rates across various\nself-designed tasks to validate our approach. To foster collaboration and\nsupport the robot learning community, we have open-sourced all relevant\ndatasets and model checkpoints, available at huggingface.co/ZhiChengAI.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12061v1) |\n| PARAPHRASUS : A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Paraphrase\n  Detection Models | Andrianos Michail, Simon Clematide, Juri Opitz |   The task of determining whether two texts are paraphrases has long been a\nchallenge in NLP. However, the prevailing notion of paraphrase is often quite\nsimplistic, offering only a limited view of the vast spectrum of paraphrase\nphenomena. Indeed, we find that evaluating models in a paraphrase dataset can\nleave uncertainty about their true semantic understanding. To alleviate this,\nwe release paraphrasus, a benchmark designed for multi-dimensional assessment\nof paraphrase detection models and finer model selection. We find that\nparaphrase detection models under a fine-grained evaluation lens exhibit\ntrade-offs that cannot be captured through a single classification dataset.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12060v1) |\n| Dual-Layer Training and Decoding of Large Language Model with\n  Simultaneously Thinking and Speaking | Ningyuan Xi, Xiaoyu Wang, Yetao Wu, Teng Chen, Qingqing Gu, Jinxian Qu, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong Chen, Luo Ji |   Large Language Model can reasonably understand and generate human expressions\nbut may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have\nbeen several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but\nmost of them are not data-driven or training-based. In this paper, we are\nmotivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel\nmodel architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts\nand then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines\nto annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt-response samples, then\nadd language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We\ntrain the language model by the thoughts-augmented data and successfully let\nthe thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally\noutput more reasonable responses.

To address these\nconcerns, recent research has focused on developing zero-knowledge machine\nlearning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of\nML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have\nsubstantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily\noptimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the\nsubstantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the\nmodel and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new\nCommit-and-Prove SNARK (CP-SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that\neffectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML\npipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white-box use of the\nunderlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic\npolynomial commitment and only makes black-box use of the proof system. As a\nresult, Artemis is compatible with state-of-the-art proof systems without\ntrusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP-SNARKs, evaluate\ntheir performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial\nimprovements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover\ncosts and maintaining efficiency even for large-scale models. For example, for\nthe VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from\n11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML\ntowards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and\ncomplex ML models.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12055v1) |\n| MMP for Enriques pairs and singular Enriques varieties | Francesco Antonio Denisi, \u00c1ngel David R\u00edos Ortiz, Nikolaos Tsakanikas, Zhixin Xie |   We introduce and study the class of primitive Enriques varieties, whose\nsmooth members are Enriques manifolds. We provide several examples and we\ndemonstrate that this class is stable under the operations of the Minimal Model\nProgram (MMP). In particular, given an Enriques manifold $Y$ and an effective\n$\\mathbb{R}$-divisor $B_Y$ on $Y$ such that the pair $(Y,B_Y)$ is log\ncanonical, we prove that any $(K_Y+B_Y)$-MMP terminates with a minimal model\n$(Y',B_{Y'})$ of $(Y,B_Y)$, where $Y'$ is a $\\mathbb{Q}$-factorial primitive\nEnriques variety with canonical singularities.

Published codes focus on\ncontinuous rotations and unitary groups, which generally are not applicable to\nsystems with strong crystal-field effects. The PointGroupNRG code implements\nsymmetries related to discrete rotation groups, which are defined by the user\nin terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, together with particle conservation\nand spin rotation symmetries. In this paper we present a new version of the\ncode that extends the available finite groups, previously limited to simply\nreducible point groups, in a way that all point and double groups become\naccessible. It also includes the full spin-orbital rotation group. Moreover, to\nimprove the code's flexibility for impurities with complex interactions, this\nnew version allows to choose between a standard Anderson Hamiltonian for the\nimpurity or, as another novel feature, an ionic model that requires only the\nspectrum and the impurity Lehmann amplitudes.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12050v1) |\n| Quantum-like nonlinear interferometry with frequency-engineered\n  classical light | Romain Dalidet, Anthony Martin, Gr\u00e9gory Sauder, Laurent Labont\u00e9, S\u00e9bastien Tanzilli |   Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic\nentanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits. Nonlinear\noptics has served as a workhorse for the generation of entangled photon pairs,\nensuring both energy and phase conservation, but at the cost of limited rate\nand degraded signal-to-noise ratio compared to laser-based interferometry\napproaches. We present a \"quantum-like\" nonlinear optical method that reaches\nsuper-resolution in single-photon detection regime. This is achieved by\nreplacing photon-pairs by coherent states of light, mimicking quantum\nproperties through classical nonlinear optics processes. Our scheme utilizes\ntwo high-brightness lasers. This results in a substantially greater\nsignal-to-noise ratio compared to its quantum counterpart. Such an approach\npaves the way to significantly reduced acquisition times, providing a pathway\nto explore signals across a broader range of bandwidth.

Analysis of\nresponses from 50 cybersecurity practitioners reveals an alarming reality: 44%\nreport experiencing severe work-related stress and burnout, while an additional\n28% are uncertain about their condition. The demanding nature of cybersecurity\nroles, unrealistic expectations, and unsupportive organizational cultures\nemerge as primary factors fueling this crisis. Notably, 66% of respondents\nperceive cybersecurity jobs as more stressful than other IT positions, with 84%\nfacing additional challenges due to the pandemic and recent high-profile\nbreaches. The study finds that most cybersecurity experts are reluctant to\nreport their struggles to management, perpetuating a cycle of silence and\nneglect. To address this critical issue, the paper recommends that\norganizations foster supportive work environments, implement mindfulness\nprograms, and address systemic challenges.

While most approaches in the Safe\nReinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and\nrobot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them\nin complex real-world settings. Instead, model-based approaches that\nincorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning\nframework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on\nthe real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot\ndynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task-specific and hard\nto obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to\ncompute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long-term safety\nrequirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe\nexploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus\non ensuring long-term safety and handling of uncertainty.

Using a general argument based on Fermi's golden rule, we show\nthat such Floquet-Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated\nRydberg atomic systems, whose lab-frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function\nof time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the\nsystem, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which\nis necessary to uphold high-lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To\ncorroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five\ninteracting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate\nnumerically that the second-order Floquet-Gibbs state of this system is\nessentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding\nRedfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently\nlarge.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12044v1) |\n| Understanding the Effects of the Baidu-ULTR Logging Policy on Two-Tower\n  Models | Morris de Haan, Philipp Hager |   Despite the popularity of the two-tower model for unbiased learning to rank\n(ULTR) tasks, recent work suggests that it suffers from a major limitation that\ncould lead to its collapse in industry applications: the problem of logging\npolicy confounding.

However, current methods often require hundreds to\nthousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual\nobservations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual\nrepresentations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or\ntrained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present\nDynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual\nrepresentations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a\nlatent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of\nimage embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without\naugmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.\nImportantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet\ndatasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real\nenvironments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly\nimprove downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised\nlearning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo\nhold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,\nand nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and\nmeasure its impact on downstream policy performance.

Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,\nwhich enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions\ninto different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to\ngenerate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning\nwith human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary\nPosition Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional\ninformation across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for\nprocessing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception\ncapabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL\ninvestigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By\nscaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the\namount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive\nperformance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to\nleading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal\nbenchmarks, outperforming other generalist models.

BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses\nand 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance\nof deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to\nintegrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and\nperformance. However, widely-used C++-based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,\ng$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries\nlike PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of\ndebugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we\nintroduce an eager-mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,\nproviding PyTorch-compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach\nincludes GPU-accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for\n2nd-order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear\nsolvers. Our eager-mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency,\nachieving an average speedup of 18.5$\\times$, 22$\\times$, and 23$\\times$\ncompared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12190v1) |\n| Massively Multi-Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context | Felix B Mueller, Julian Tanke, Juergen Gall |   Forecasting long-term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of\nhuman behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input\nsequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby\npeople can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene-aware social\ntransformer model (SAST) to forecast long-term (10s) human motion motion.\nUnlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely\nvarying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal\nconvolutional encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer-based bottleneck\nthat allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model\nthe conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We\nbenchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to\n16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously. Our model\noutperforms other approaches in terms of realism and diversity on different\nmetrics and in a user study.

Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon |   Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a\nperfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from\nfundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\\mu$-distortion) to late-time\nbaryonic feedback processes (y-distortion). While the y-distortion can be\ndetected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the\n$\\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude\nsmaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a\nserious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\\mu$\narises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the\nprimordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \\approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here,\nwe present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly\ndetecting $\\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but\nwith an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we\noptimize the instrument's configuration to target $\\mu$ while robustly\nmarginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike\nFourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their\nindividual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing\nsignificant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the\n$\\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\\mu$-distortion at $\\approx 5\\sigma$ (10$\\sigma$)\nassuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission\nduration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized\nconfiguration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular\nresolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally\nmeasure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic\ncorrection at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total\nthermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12188v1) |\n| Exoplanet accretion monitoring spectroscopic survey (ENTROPY) I.\n  Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary-mass\n  object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C. Ringqvist, Dorian Demars, Markus Janson, Micka\u00ebl Bonnefoy, Yuhiko Aoyama, Gabriel-Dominique Marleau, Catherine Dougados, Judit Szul\u00e1gyi, Thanawuth Thanathibodee |   Accretion among planets is a poorly understood phenomenon, due to lack of\nboth observational and theoretical studies.

This\nwork presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known\nyoung, planetary-mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf\n2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7-21 Mj and age 5-45 Myr, located at 45+-2\npc. We obtained the first high-resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target\nwith VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near-UV to visible wavelengths (3200-6800\nAA). We report resolved H3-H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.\nBased on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+-1\nkm/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR\nexcess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of\nthe parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+-63 K and radius to 1.5+-0.1\nRj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet-surface shock model\nimplies a pre-shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,-40) km/s and a pre-shock\ndensity of log(n0/cm^-3)=14(+0,-5). Pre-shock velocity points to a mass of\n6(+8,-4) Mj for the target.

Xu |   The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our\nlocal solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions\nit exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong\ndynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).\nConsequently, it is likely that there are large-scale physical structures\nwithin the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we\npresent new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\n(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a\nmulti-wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the\nM0.8$-$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring-like morphology. We\nestimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring to be 79\"\nand 154\", respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre\ndistance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $> 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, a\nmass of $\\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\\odot$, and an expansion speed of $\\sim$ 20 km\ns$^{-1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($> 10^{51}$ erg) and\nmomentum ($> 10^7$ M$_\\odot$ km s$^{-1}$). We discuss several possible causes\nfor the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback\nand large-scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the\nM0.8$-$0.2 ring is a single high-energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain\nthe observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have\ntaken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which\nwe now see as the M0.8$-$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an\nextreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12185v1) |\n| To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic\n  reasoning | Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett |   Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting\nreasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of\ntasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted\na quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own\nevaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives\nstrong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with\nmuch smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the\nanswer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the\nquestion or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic\noperations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of\nCoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing\nagainst tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic\nexecution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our\nresults indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance\nwhile saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond\nprompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation\nacross the whole range of LLM applications.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183v1) |\n| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs | Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T. Chiu, Siyu Ren, Fei Yuan, Wenting Zhao, Zhiyong Wu, Alexander M. Rush |   Broad textual understanding and in-context learning require language models\nthat utilize full document contexts. Due to the implementation challenges\nassociated with directly training long-context models, many methods have been\nproposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to\ndifferences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these\napproaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long-context\nperformance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a\ncontrolled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation,\nutilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several\ninsights into long-context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of\nperplexity as a general-purpose performance indicator even in longer-context\ntasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods\nsystematically underperform across long-context tasks. Finally, we confirm that\nexact fine-tuning based methods are generally effective within the range of\ntheir extension, whereas extrapolation remains challenging. All codebases,\nmodels, and checkpoints will be made available open-source, promoting\ntransparency and facilitating further research in this critical area of AI\ndevelopment.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12181v1) |\n| Finetuning Language Models to Emit Linguistic Expressions of Uncertainty | Arslan Chaudhry, Sridhar Thiagarajan, Dilan Gorur |   Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in information-seeking\nand decision-making tasks. Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate\ninformation that conflicts with real-world facts, and their persuasive style\ncan make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result,\nend-users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with\nthe accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all\noutputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore\nsupervised finetuning on uncertainty-augmented predictions as a method to\ndevelop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty.\nSpecifically, we measure the calibration of pre-trained models and then\nfine-tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of\nuncertainty. Through experiments on various question-answering datasets, we\ndemonstrate that LLMs are well-calibrated in assessing their predictions, and\nsupervised finetuning based on the model's own confidence leads to\nwell-calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single-claim\nanswers.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12180v1) |\n| Computational Dynamical Systems | Jordan Cotler, Semon Rezchikov |   We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite-dimensional\ndynamical systems. Building off of previous work, we give definitions for what\nit means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine. We then\nshow that 'chaotic' dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and\n'integrable' dynamical systems (more generally, measure-preserving systems)\ncannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines can\nbe robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, we\nshow that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable\none-dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and\nmoreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt.\nMore broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one 'machine' to simulate\nanother, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low-complexity 'encoders' and\n'decoders' to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system\nbeing simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical\nsystem leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity\ntheory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12179v1) |\n| Poisson approximate likelihood compared to the particle filter | Yize Hao, Aaron A. Abkemeier, Edward L. Ionides |   Filtering algorithms are fundamental for inference on partially observed\nstochastic dynamic systems, since they provide access to the likelihood\nfunction and hence enable likelihood-based or Bayesian inference. A novel\nPoisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.\n(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering\na fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of\npartially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL\nis the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large\nimprovement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,\nbased on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.\n(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should\nuse PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence\nalso reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a\nshortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that\nthe comparison of log-likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al. (2023) is\nflawed because their PAL calculations were carried out using a dataset scaled\ndifferently from the previous study. If PAL and the particle filter are applied\nto the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears. On simulations\nwhere the model is correctly specified, the particle filter outperforms PAL.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12173v1) |\n| You Only Read Once (YORO): Learning to Internalize Database Knowledge\n  for Text-to-SQL | Hideo Kobayashi, Wuwei Lan, Peng Shi, Shuaichen Chang, Jiang Guo, Henghui Zhu, Zhiguo Wang, Patrick Ng |   While significant progress has been made on the text-to-SQL task, recent\nsolutions repeatedly encode the same database schema for every question,\nresulting in unnecessary high inference cost and often overlooking crucial\ndatabase knowledge. To address these issues, we propose You Only Read Once\n(YORO), a novel paradigm that directly internalizes database knowledge into the\nparametric knowledge of a text-to-SQL model during training and eliminates the\nneed for schema encoding during inference. YORO significantly reduces the input\ntoken length by 66%-98%. Despite its shorter inputs, our empirical results\ndemonstrate YORO's competitive performances with traditional systems on three\nbenchmarks as well as its significant outperformance on large databases.\nFurthermore, YORO excels in handling questions with challenging value\nretrievals such as abbreviation.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12172v1) |\n| Ergodic properties of infinite extension of symmetric interval exchange\n  transformations | Przemys\u0142aw Berk, Frank Trujillo, Hao Wu |   We prove that skew products with the cocycle given by the function\n$f(x)=a(x-1/2)$ with $a\\neq 0$ are ergodic for every ergodic symmetric IET in\nthe base, thus giving the full characterization of ergodic extensions in this\nfamily. Moreover, we prove that under an additional natural assumption of\nunique ergodicity on the IET, we can replace $f$ with any differentiable\nfunction with a non-zero sum of jumps. Finally, by considering weakly mixing\nIETs instead of just ergodic, we show that the skew products with cocycle given\nby $f$ have infinite ergodic index.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12168v1) |\n| multiPI-TransBTS: A Multi-Path Learning Framework for Brain Tumor Image\n  Segmentation Based on Multi-Physical Information | Hongjun Zhu, Jiaohang Huang, Kuo Chen, Xuehui Ying, Ying Qian |   Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis,\ntreatment planning, and monitoring the progression of brain tumors. However,\ndue to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across\ndifferent MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In\nthis study, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework, multiPI-TransBTS,\nwhich integrates multi-physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.\nThe model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi-modal\nimaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor\ncharacteristics. The multiPI-TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an\nAdaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi-source, multi-scale feature\ndecoder. The encoder incorporates a multi-branch architecture to separately\nextract modality-specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module\nfuses information from multiple sources using channel-wise and element-wise\nattention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both\ncommon and task-specific features through a Task-Specific Feature Introduction\n(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),\nTumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on\nthe BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nmultiPI-TransBTS over the state-of-the-art methods. The model consistently\nachieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,\nhighlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results\nalso indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision\nand recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a\nsignificant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving\nclinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12167v1) |\n| Synchrotron self-Compton in a radiative-adiabatic fireball scenario:\n  Modelling the multiwavelength observations in some Fermi/LAT bursts | Nissim Fraija, P. Veres, B. Betancourt Kamenetskaia, A. Galvan-Gamez, M. G. Dainotti, Simone Dichiara, R. L. Becerra |   Energetic GeV photons expected from the closest and the most energetic\nGamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provide an unique opportunity to study the\nvery-high-energy emission as well as the possible correlations with lower\nenergy bands in realistic GRB afterglow models. In the standard GRB afterglow\nmodel, the relativistic homogeneous shock is usually considered to be fully\nadiabatic, however, it could be partially radiative. Based on the external\nforward-shock scenario in both stellar wind and constant-density medium. We\npresent a radiative-adiabatic analytical model of the synchrotron self-Compton\n(SSC) and synchrotron processes considering an electron energy distribution\nwith a power-law index of 1 < p < 2 and 2 $\\leq$ p. We show that the SSC\nscenario plays a relevant role in the radiative parameter $\\epsilon$, leading\nto a prolonged evolution during the slow cooling regime. In a particular case,\nwe derive the Fermi/LAT light curves together with the photons with energies\n$\\geq$ 100 MeV in a sample of nine bursts from the second Fermi/LAT GRB catalog\nthat exhibited temporal and spectral indices with $\\geq$ 1.5 and $\\approx$ 2,\nrespectively. These events can hardly be described with closure relations of\nthe standard synchrotron afterglow model, and also exhibit energetic photons\nabove the synchrotron limit. We have modeled the multi-wavelength observations\nof our sample to constrain the microphysical parameters, the circumburst\ndensity, the bulk Lorentz factor and the mechanism responsible for explaining\nthe energetic GeV photons.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12166v1) |\n| Blind Deconvolution on Graphs: Exact and Stable Recovery | Chang Ye, Gonzalo Mateos |   We study a blind deconvolution problem on graphs, which arises in the context\nof localizing a few sources that diffuse over networks. While the observations\nare bilinear functions of the unknown graph filter coefficients and sparse\ninput signals, a mild requirement on invertibility of the diffusion filter\nenables an efficient convex relaxation leading to a linear programming\nformulation that can be tackled with off-the-shelf solvers. Under the\nBernoulli-Gaussian model for the inputs, we derive sufficient exact recovery\nconditions in the noise-free setting. A stable recovery result is then\nestablished, ensuring the estimation error remains manageable even when the\nobservations are corrupted by a small amount of noise. Numerical tests with\nsynthetic and real-world network data illustrate the merits of the proposed\nalgorithm, its robustness to noise as well as the benefits of leveraging\nmultiple signals to aid the (blind) localization of sources of diffusion. At a\nfundamental level, the results presented here broaden the scope of classical\nblind deconvolution of (spatio-)temporal signals to irregular graph domains.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12164v1) |\n| Generalized compression and compressive search of large datasets | Morgan E. Prior, Thomas Howard III, Emily Light, Najib Ishaq, Noah M. Daniels |   The Big Data explosion has necessitated the development of search algorithms\nthat scale sub-linearly in time and memory.\n  While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently,\nfew algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain-specific.\n  We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to\nperform $k$-NN and $\\rho$-NN search on compressed data while only decompressing\na small, relevant, portion of the data.\n  panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low-dimensional\nstructure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.\n  panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between\ntwo points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in\nterms of the other.\n  This property holds for many widely-used distance functions, e.g. string edit\ndistances (Levenshtein, Needleman-Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures\n(Jaccard, Dice, etc.).\n  We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic,\nand set data.\n  We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the\ncompressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.\n  panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering\nsub-linear time performance for $k$-NN and $\\rho$-NN search.\n  We conclude that panCAKES is an efficient, general-purpose algorithm for\nexact compressive search on large datasets that obey the manifold hypothesis.\n  We provide an open-source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming\nlanguage.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12161v1) |\n| WeHelp: A Shared Autonomy System for Wheelchair Users | Abulikemu Abuduweili, Alice Wu, Tianhao Wei, Weiye Zhao |   There is a large population of wheelchair users. Most of the wheelchair users\nneed help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs\nare not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this\nproject, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair\nusers. A robot with a WeHelp system has three modes, following mode, remote\ncontrol mode and tele-operation mode. In the following mode, the robot follows\nthe wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can\nask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the\nwheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech\nrecognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode.\nIn the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy\nstick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs,\nsuch as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high\nshelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant\ntakes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks\nfor their needs. Our evaluation shows that the pipeline is useful and practical\nfor wheelchair users.

These IFSs\nexhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are\ntopologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the\nBlonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave\nsuperconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients\nincluding thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and\nexamine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage\nand temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of\n$d$-wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the\nnormal-superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric\nresponse. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in\nSeebeck coefficient ($\\sim 200\\,\\mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($\\sim 3.5$) due to the\ngeneration of the IFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for\ndevice applications.

Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker\nidentity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a NeRF-based network. Since we train our network on\nmonocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn\ndisentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio\nfeatures in a self-supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects.\nBy incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned\naudio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle\nmotion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer-based architecture\nthat learns expression features, capturing long-range facial expressions and\ndisentangling them from the speech-specific mouth movements. Through\nquantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can\nsynthesize high-fidelity talking face videos, achieving state-of-the-art facial\nexpression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12156v1) |\n| Autopet III challenge: Incorporating anatomical knowledge into nnUNet\n  for lesion segmentation in PET/CT | Hamza Kalisch, Fabian H\u00f6rst, Ken Herrmann, Jens Kleesiek, Constantin Seibold |   Lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging is essential for precise tumor\ncharacterization, which supports personalized treatment planning and enhances\ndiagnostic precision in oncology. However, accurate manual segmentation of\nlesions is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. Given the\nrising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods,\nparticularly deep-learning-based approaches, have become increasingly more\nrelevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation\nof tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting,\naddressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable\nsolutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET\nchallenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers\n(FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers. To this extent, we developed a\nclassifier that identifies the tracer of the given PET/CT based on the Maximum\nIntensity Projection of the PET scan. We trained two individual\nnnUNet-ensembles for each tracer where anatomical labels are included as a\nmulti-label task to enhance the model's performance.

However, a\nrobot's ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if\nnaively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach-avoid\ndynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a\nsafety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human's behavior\nas goal-driven but conditioned on the robot's plan, enabling us to capture\ninfluence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical\nand belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in\nhuman behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE\n(Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high-dimensional\n(39-D) simulated human-robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline\ngame-theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust\nbaseline that treats the human as a worst-case adversary, a safety controller\nthat does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy-function-based\nsafety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage\nthe influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing\nthe robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate\nduring task execution.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12153v1) |\n| Decoding Style: Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Image-Guided Outfit\n  Recommendation with Preference | Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan |   Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding\nboth fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper\npresents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their \"black box\" and static\nnature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item\nvisual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a\nMultimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style\nand color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis\nfor personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the\nopen-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability\nto recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative\nexamples is employed to enhance the LLM's decision-making process. This creates\na self-enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in\nline with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore\ndataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill-in-the-blank,\nand complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework's\nability to generate stylish, trend-aligned outfit suggestions, continuously\nimproving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our\nproposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more\ncohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the\nproposed framework's potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate\nsuggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit\ngeneration.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12150v1) |\n| Mechanical Wannier-Stark Ladder of Diamond Spin-Mechanical Lamb Wave\n  Resonators | Philip Andrango, Hailin Wang |   We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier-Stark ladders of\ndiamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with\nultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin\nproperties.

While these improve performance, they often reach a\nsaturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated\nfeedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key\nchallenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can\nover-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and\naddress errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to\nidentify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding\nhow many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too\nsoon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose\nMAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty\nas easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard\nones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error\nlocalization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores.\nMoreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with\nthree agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on\nstep-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure\nsufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating\nfurther rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5\nand show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of\nMAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by\n4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with\nbaselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our\nablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe's RMs and multi-agent\ncommunication.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147v1) |\n| Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka |   Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string\nprocessing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into\nblocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence\nof a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another\noccurrence earlier in $T$. Due to numerous applications, LZ77 factorization is\none of the most studied problems on strings. In the 47 years since its\ninception, several algorithms were developed for different models of\ncomputation, including parallel, GPU, external-memory, and quantum. Remarkably,\nhowever, the complexity of the most basic variant is still not settled: All\nexisting algorithms in the RAM model run in $\\Omega(n)$ time, which is a\n$\\Theta(\\log n)$ factor away from the lower bound of $\\Omega(n/\\log n)$\n(following from the necessity to read the input, which takes $\\Theta(n/\\log n)$\nspace for $T\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}$).\n  We present the first $o(n)$-time algorithm for LZ77 factorization, breaking\nthe linear-time barrier present for nearly 50 years. For $T\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}$, our\nalgorithm runs in $\\mathcal{O}(n/\\sqrt{\\log n})=o(n)$ time and uses the optimal\n$\\mathcal{O}(n/\\log n)$ working space. Our algorithm generalizes to\n$\\Sigma=[0..\\sigma)$, where $\\sigma=n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The runtime and\nworking space then become $\\mathcal{O}((n\\log\\sigma)/\\sqrt{\\log n})$ and\n$\\mathcal{O}(n/\\log_{\\sigma} n)$. To obtain our algorithm, we prove a more\ngeneral result: For any constant $\\epsilon\\in(0,1)$ and $T\\in[0..\\sigma)^{n}$,\nin $\\mathcal{O}((n\\log\\sigma)/\\sqrt{\\log n})$ time and using\n$\\mathcal{O}(n/\\log_{\\sigma}n)$ space, we can construct an\n$\\mathcal{O}(n/\\log_{\\sigma}n)$-size index that, given any $P=T[j..j+\\ell)$\n(represented as $(j,\\ell)$), computes the leftmost occurrence of $P$ in $T$ in\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log^{\\epsilon}n)$ time.

The method enhances\nmotion diffusion models by leveraging additional knowledge obtained through an\nimproved motion retrieval process. By effectively prompting large language\nmodels (LLMs), we address spelling errors and rephrasing issues in motion\nretrieval. Our approach utilizes a multi-part retrieval strategy to improve the\ngeneralizability of motion retrieval across the language space. We create\ndiverse samples through the spatial composition of the retrieved motions.\nFurthermore, by utilizing low-level, part-specific motion information, we can\nconstruct motion samples for unseen text descriptions. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that our framework can serve as a plug-and-play module, improving\nthe performance of motion diffusion models.

In this\nreport, we introduce Takin AudioLLM, a series of techniques and models, mainly\nincluding Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, specifically designed for\naudiobook production. These models are capable of zero-shot speech production,\ngenerating high-quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human\nspeech and facilitating individuals to customize the speech content according\nto their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec\nlanguage model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a\nmulti-task training framework, capable of generating high-fidelity natural\nspeech in a zero-shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and\ntimbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while\nadvocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its\nnaturalness and expressiveness. Last, we propose the Takin Morphing system with\nhighly decoupled and advanced timbre and prosody modeling approaches, which\nenables individuals to customize speech production with their preferred timbre\nand prosody in a precise and controllable manner. Extensive experiments\nvalidate the effectiveness and robustness of our Takin AudioLLM series models.\nFor detailed demos, please refer to https://takinaudiollm.github.io.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12139v1) |\n| GRIN: GRadient-INformed MoE | Liyuan Liu, Young Jin Kim, Shuohang Wang, Chen Liang, Yelong Shen, Hao Cheng, Xiaodong Liu, Masahiro Tanaka, Xiaoxia Wu, Wenxiang Hu, Vishrav Chaudhary, Zeqi Lin, Chenruidong Zhang, Jilong Xue, Hany Awadalla, Jianfeng Gao, Weizhu Chen |   Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale more effectively than dense models due\nto sparse computation through expert routing, selectively activating only a\nsmall subset of expert modules. However, sparse computation challenges\ntraditional training practices, as discrete expert routing hinders standard\nbackpropagation and thus gradient-based optimization, which are the cornerstone\nof deep learning. To better pursue the scaling power of MoE, we introduce GRIN\n(GRadient-INformed MoE training), which incorporates sparse gradient estimation\nfor expert routing and configures model parallelism to avoid token dropping.\nApplying GRIN to autoregressive language modeling, we develop a top-2\n16$\\times$3.8B MoE model. Our model, with only 6.6B activated parameters,\noutperforms a 7B dense model and matches the performance of a 14B dense model\ntrained on the same data. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks\ndemonstrate the potential of GRIN to significantly enhance MoE efficacy,\nachieving 79.4 on MMLU, 83.7 on HellaSwag, 74.4 on HumanEval, and 58.9 on MATH.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12136v1) |\n| BERT-VBD: Vietnamese Multi-Document Summarization Framework | Tuan-Cuong Vuong, Trang Mai Xuan, Thien Van Luong |   In tackling the challenge of Multi-Document Summarization (MDS), numerous\nmethods have been proposed, spanning both extractive and abstractive\nsummarization techniques. However, each approach has its own limitations,\nmaking it less effective to rely solely on either one. An emerging and\npromising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractive\nsummarization methods. Despite the plethora of studies in this domain, research\non the combined methodology remains scarce, particularly in the context of\nVietnamese language processing. This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDS\nframework leveraging a two-component pipeline architecture that integrates\nextractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs an\nextractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This is\nachieved by a modification of the pre-trained BERT network, which derives\nsemantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet network\nstructures. The second component utilizes the VBD-LLaMA2-7B-50b model for\nabstractive summarization, ultimately generating the final summary document.\nOur proposed framework demonstrates a positive performance, attaining ROUGE-2\nscores of 39.6% on the VN-MDS dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art\nbaselines.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12134v1) |\n| Einstein-dilaton-four-Maxwell Holographic Anisotropic Models | Irina Ya. Aref'eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov |   In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the\nfive-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell models has played a crucial role.\nTypically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while\nadditional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A\nmore general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field\nrepresents spatial longitudinal-transverse anisotropy, while the third and\nfourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We\nconsider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero\ntemperature and five functions at non-zero temperature. Maxwell field related\nto the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,\nwhereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.\nWe demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of\nthe seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations -- either the\ndilaton or the vector potential equation -- follows from the Einstein equations\nand the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi\nidentity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress-energy\ntensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is\nprovided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to\nthree Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis\nshows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein\nequations and the equation for the vector potential\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12131v1) |\n| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components\n  for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco-Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram |   Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data\ntogether with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal\ncomponents used. It is therefore important to determine the number of\nsignificant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a\nvariational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for\nestimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of\nsamples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This\neliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of\nprincipal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.\nThis framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows\nand columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),\nand with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data\nwith arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as\ncultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our\nmethod on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may\nunderestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the\nsynthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical\ndataset. These results suggest that it is broadly applicable across the life\nsciences.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12129v1) |\n| Linguini: A benchmark for language-agnostic linguistic reasoning | Eduardo S\u00e1nchez, Belen Alastruey, Christophe Ropers, Pontus Stenetorp, Mikel Artetxe, Marta R.

The test\ncovers 894 questions grouped in 160 problems across 75 (mostly) extremely\nlow-resource languages, extracted from the International Linguistic Olympiad\ncorpus. To attain high accuracy on this benchmark, models don't need previous\nknowledge of the tested language, as all the information needed to solve the\nlinguistic puzzle is presented in the context. We find that, while all analyzed\nmodels rank below 25% accuracy, there is a significant gap between open and\nclosed models, with the best-performing proprietary model at 24.05% and the\nbest-performing open model at 8.84%.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12126v1) |\n| From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the\n  primordial black hole reheating scenario | Guillem Dom\u00e8nech, Jan Tr\u00e4nkle |   We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs\noriginate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight\nPBHs with masses $M\\lesssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat\nit via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate\nwhether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH\nreheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the\ninitial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer\nfunctions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and\nisocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation\nof state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH\ndominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the\nspectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive\nto $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density\nfluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance\nas a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\nobservations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the\ninitial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we\nfind that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several\nfuture GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas,\nespecially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any\nearly matter-dominated universe scenario.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12125v1) |\n| Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules | Anqi Zhang, Wilson S. Geisler |   Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We\ninvestigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented\ndisplays having well-separated potential target-object locations. Performance\nwas compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption\nthat the information from the different potential target locations is\nstatistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than\noptimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the\nimplausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show\nthat three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical\nresults. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near\noptimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the\ncentral potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise\ncauses search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These\nfindings have far-reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks\nand other identification tasks in humans and other animals.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12124v1) |\n| Far-from-equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann\n  approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows\n  $v_n$ | Vincenzo Nugara, Vincenzo Greco, Salvatore Plumari |   We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal\nsystem in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution\nfunction and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system\nsizes $R$ and interaction strength $\\eta/s$ and identify universality classes\nbased upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each\nof this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $\\hat\n\\gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results\nhighlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum\nmoments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to\na 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of\ndifferent sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a\nsimilar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse\nflow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system\nsize and $\\eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and\ntheir response functions, along with the impact of the $\\eta/s$ and the system\ntransverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in\nmomentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow\n$v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of\nlarge opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems\nevolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play\nin this process.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12123v1) |\n| Qwen2.5-Math Technical Report: Toward Mathematical Expert Model via\n  Self-Improvement | An Yang, Beichen Zhang, Binyuan Hui, Bofei Gao, Bowen Yu, Chengpeng Li, Dayiheng Liu, Jianhong Tu, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin, Keming Lu, Mingfeng Xue, Runji Lin, Tianyu Liu, Xingzhang Ren, Zhenru Zhang |   In this report, we present a series of math-specific large language models:\nQwen2.5-Math and Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct-1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the\nQwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self-improvement\nthroughout the entire pipeline, from pre-training and post-training to\ninference: (1) During the pre-training phase, Qwen2-Math-Instruct is utilized\nto generate large-scale, high-quality mathematical data. (2) In the\npost-training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive\nsampling from Qwen2-Math-Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative\nevolution of data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model,\nit's possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the\nnext round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the\nultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct.\n(3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling,\noptimizing the model's performance.\n  Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced\nmathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and\nTool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics\ndatasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and\nAIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math\ncompetition problems.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12122v1) |\n| Computing the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two-Dimensional\n  Strongly-Correlated Systems | Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn |   We show that the two-dimensional $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time-reversal\ninvariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary-condition\ndependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non-interacting and\nstrongly-correlated insulators. By introducing a family of quasi-single\nparticle states associated to the many-body ground state of an insulator, we\nshow that the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant can be expressed as the integral of a\ncertain Berry connection over half the space of boundary conditions, providing\nan alternative expression to the formulations that appear in [Lee et al., Phys.\nRev.

We show the equivalence of the\ndifferent many-body formulations of the invariant, and show how they reduce to\nknown band-theoretic results for Slater determinant ground states. Finally, we\napply our results to analytically calculate the invariant for the Kane-Mele\nmodel with nonlocal (orbital) Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) interactions. This\nrigorously establishes the topological nontriviality of the Kane-Mele model\nwith HK interactions, and represents one of the few exact calculations of the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a strongly-interacting system.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12120v1) |\n| Weak Lensing analysis of Abell 2390 using short exposures | A.

Sembroski |   We present a weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 2390 at z =\n0.23 using second moment shape measurements made in 411 short 60s exposures.\nThe exposures are obtained in three broadband photometric filters (g, r, i)\nusing WIYN-ODI. Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a\nmoment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching\nalgorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The\nmeasurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight\nto obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim\nsimulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find\nthe mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We\nalso find the E-Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic\nstructures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical\nand X-Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to\nmap large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of\nthe cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the\npeaks are similar to X-Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster\nand show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12119v1) |\n| Low Frame-rate Speech Codec: a Codec Designed for Fast High-quality\n  Speech LLM Training and Inference | Edresson Casanova, Ryan Langman, Paarth Neekhara, Shehzeen Hussain, Jason Li, Subhankar Ghosh, Ante Juki\u0107, Sang-gil Lee |   Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing\nthrough audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the\napplication of language modeling techniques to audio data.

Through a series of case studies,\nwe find that the common practice of omitting baselines or comparing against a\nweak baseline model (e.g. a linear model with no optimization) obscures the\nvalue of ML methods proposed in the research literature.

Johnson |   Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide\nstringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post-BBN (Big\nBang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models\nwith COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.\nHere, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark\nphoton conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous\nworks only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the\nchange to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon\ndistortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the\ndistortion has an opposite sign and a $\\simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We\nfurthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover\nthe redshift range $\\simeq 2\\times 10^6-4\\times 10^7$ between the $\\mu$-era and\nthe end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints\nfor dark photon masses in the range $10^{-4}\\,{\\rm eV}\\lesssim m_{\\rm\ndp}\\lesssim 10^{-3}\\,{\\rm eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We\ndemonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon\nto dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $\\mu$-type distortion\nindependent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study\ndark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with\nCMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12115v1) |\n| Bi-objective trail-planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous\n  environment | Cory M.

Robot teams traversing hazardous environments -- with e.g.\nrough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or\ncapturing robots -- should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of\nrisks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should\ntake the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the\nteam-level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward\nfrom visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider\nbi-objective trail-planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a\nhazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed\ngraph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of\nsurvival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a\nrobot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for\nthe Pareto-optimal robot-team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team\nobjectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive\nthe mission. A human decision-maker can then select trail plans that balance,\naccording to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony\noptimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto-optimal set of\nrobot team trail plans.

We demonstrate that strategic\ndata reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing\nbandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies\nMinimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource-constrained\nenvironments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient\npractices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and\noverprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for\noptimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data\nrepresentation. An experimental methodology demonstrates effective acoustic\ndata characterization after downsampling, quantization, and truncation to\nsimulate reduced-fidelity sensors and network and storage constraints; results\nshows that performance can be maintained up to 95\\% with sample rates reduced\nby 75\\% and bit depths and clip length reduced by 50\\% which translates into\nsubstantial cost and resource reduction. These findings have implications on\nthe design and development of constrained systems.

Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a\npowerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,\ncomplex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in\nperformance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and\nits innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer\nknowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact\nand efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application\nacross various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and\nhistorical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are\nhighlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational\nefficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical\ndeployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of\nKD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the\nbreadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case\nstudies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,\nsuch as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review\ndiscusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical\nconstraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive\noverview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS. Through this\norganization, the paper not only elucidates the current state of research in KD\nbut also sets the stage for future research opportunities, thereby contributing\nsignificantly to both academic research and real-world applications.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12111v1) |\n| It depends: Varieties of defining growth dependence | Anja Janischewski, Katharina Bohnenberger, Matthias Kranke, Tobias Vogel, Riwan Driouich, Tobias Froese, Stefanie Gerold, Raphael Kaufmann, Lorenz Key\u00dfer, Jannis Niethammer, Christopher Olk, Matthias Schmelzer, Asl\u0131 Y\u00fcr\u00fck, Steffen Lange |   Many socio-economic systems require positive economic growth rates to\nfunction properly. Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing\nevidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,\nthese growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,\nmore and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth-dependent systems\nand develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of\n'growth dependence' still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,\nwhich impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article\nproposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the\nconcept of 'growth dependence' across socio-economic systems. We provide a\ngeneral definition consisting of four components that can be specified for\ndifferent empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of\nmeasurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions\nor properties of the system under investigation. According to our general\ndefinition, a socio-economic system is growth-dependent if it requires a\nlong-term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to\nmaintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen\nnormative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to\nthree areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:\nemployment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies\ndemonstrate that whether or not a system is growth-dependent hinges not only on\nthe empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of\nthe concept of growth dependence.

Computer-assisted Surgery systems\nhave played a crucial role in improving the precision and safety of ESD\nprocedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognition\nof surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesion\ncharacteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real-time\nsurgical phase recognition algorithms. Existing surgical phase recognition\nalgorithms struggle to efficiently capture temporal contexts in video-based\nscenarios, leading to insufficient performance. To address these issues, we\npropose SPRMamba, a novel Mamba-based framework for ESD surgical phase\nrecognition. SPRMamba leverages the strengths of Mamba for long-term temporal\nmodeling while introducing the Scaled Residual TranMamba block to enhance the\ncapture of fine-grained details, overcoming the limitations of traditional\ntemporal models like Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformers.\nMoreover, a Temporal Sample Strategy is introduced to accelerate the\nprocessing, which is essential for real-time phase recognition in clinical\nsettings. Extensive testing on the ESD385 dataset and the cholecystectomy\nCholec80 dataset demonstrates that SPRMamba surpasses existing state-of-the-art\nmethods and exhibits greater robustness across various surgical phase\nrecognition tasks.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12108v1) |\n| Who's the GOAT? Sports Rankings and Data-Driven Random Walks on the\n  Symmetric Group | Gian-Gabriel P. Garcia, J. Carlos Mart\u00ednez Mori |   Given a collection of historical sports rankings, can one tell which player\nis the greatest of all time (i.e., the GOAT)? In this work, we design a\ndata-driven random walk on the symmetric group to obtain a stationary\ndistribution over player rankings, spanning across different time periods in\nsports history. We combine this distribution with a notion of stochastic\ndominance to obtain a partial order over the players. We implement our methods\nusing publicly available data from the Association of Tennis Professionals\n(ATP) and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) to find the GOATs in the\nrespective categories.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12107v1) |\n| Measuring Human and AI Values based on Generative Psychometrics with\n  Large Language Models | Haoran Ye, Yuhang Xie, Yuanyi Ren, Hanjun Fang, Xin Zhang, Guojie Song |   Human values and their measurement are long-standing interdisciplinary\ninquiry. Recent advances in AI have sparked renewed interest in this area, with\nlarge language models (LLMs) emerging as both tools and subjects of value\nmeasurement. This work introduces Generative Psychometrics for Values (GPV), an\nLLM-based, data-driven value measurement paradigm, theoretically grounded in\ntext-revealed selective perceptions. We begin by fine-tuning an LLM for\naccurate perception-level value measurement and verifying the capability of\nLLMs to parse texts into perceptions, forming the core of the GPV pipeline.\nApplying GPV to human-authored blogs, we demonstrate its stability, validity,\nand superiority over prior psychological tools. Then, extending GPV to LLM\nvalue measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometric\nmethodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free-form\noutputs, enabling context-specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis of\nmeasurement paradigms, indicating response biases of prior methods; and 3) an\nattempt to bridge LLM values and their safety, revealing the predictive power\nof different value systems and the impacts of various values on LLM safety.\nThrough interdisciplinary efforts, we aim to leverage AI for next-generation\npsychometrics and psychometrics for value-aligned AI.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12106v1) |\n| FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated\n  Long-Tailed Learning | Xiuhua Lu, Peng Li, Xuefeng Jiang |   Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy\nin distributed machine learning. However, datasets distributed across each\nclient in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can\nbe globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly\naffects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated\nlearning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it\nfails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data.\nThis results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting\nthe equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a\nmethodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,\nwe propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the\nlocal training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred\noptimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state-of-the-art\nmethods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed\ndistribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10-LT and\nCIFAR-100-LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of\nmodel performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long-tailed\ndistribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12105v1) |\n| Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error\n  Detection | Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia |   Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications. Doing\nso requires overcoming the noise present on today's hardware. The quantum\napproximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling\nup due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup\nover state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems. However,\nachieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require\nfault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant\nimplementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection\ncode. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the\nalgorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with\nup to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we\npropose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance, and use it\nto characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance\nto future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our\nmodel can be used to determine necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform\nGoemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware. Our results demonstrate the\nlargest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially\nfault-tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date,\npaving the way towards solving real-world applications with quantum computers.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12104v1) |\n| Cyclicity Analysis of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process | Vivek Kaushik |   In this thesis, we consider an $N$-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)\nprocess satisfying the linear stochastic differential equation $d\\mathbf x(t) =\n- \\mathbf B\\mathbf x(t) dt + \\boldsymbol \\Sigma d \\mathbf w(t).$ Here, $\\mathbf\nB$ is a fixed $N \\times N$ circulant friction matrix whose eigenvalues have\npositive real parts, $\\boldsymbol \\Sigma$ is a fixed $N \\times M$ matrix. We\nconsider a signal propagation model governed by this OU process. In this model,\nan underlying signal propagates throughout a network consisting of $N$ linked\nsensors located in space. We interpret the $n$-th component of the OU process\nas the measurement of the propagating effect made by the $n$-th sensor. The\nmatrix $\\mathbf B$ represents the sensor network structure: if $\\mathbf B$ has\nfirst row $(b_1 \\ , \\ \\dots \\ , \\ b_N),$ where $b_1>0$ and $b_2 \\ , \\ \\dots \\\n,\\ b_N \\le 0,$ then the magnitude of $b_p$ quantifies how receptive the $n$-th\nsensor is to activity within the $(n+p-1)$-th sensor. Finally, the $(m,n)$-th\nentry of the matrix $\\mathbf D = \\frac{\\boldsymbol \\Sigma \\boldsymbol\n\\Sigma^\\text T}{2}$ is the covariance of the component noises injected into the\n$m$-th and $n$-th sensors. For different choices of $\\mathbf B$ and\n$\\boldsymbol \\Sigma,$ we investigate whether Cyclicity Analysis enables us to\nrecover the structure of network. Roughly speaking, Cyclicity Analysis studies\nthe lead-lag dynamics pertaining to the components of a multivariate signal. We\nspecifically consider an $N \\times N$ skew-symmetric matrix $\\mathbf Q,$ known\nas the lead matrix, in which the sign of its $(m,n)$-th entry captures the\nlead-lag relationship between the $m$-th and $n$-th component OU processes.

Recently, this\ncuriosity has motivated the fMRI-to-image reconstruction task; given the fMRI\ndata from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual\nstimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent\nDiffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex\nvisual stimuli such as high-resolution natural images from vision datasets.\nDespite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often\nlack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.\nConsequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere\nvisuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs\neffectively incorporate multi-modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,\nand image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image\ngenerations. Specifically, inspired by the two-streams hypothesis suggesting\nthat perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain\nregions, our framework, Brain-Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain\nregions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from\nsemantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information\nregions, Brain-Streams provides accurate multi-modal guidance to LDMs. We\nvalidate the reconstruction ability of Brain-Streams both quantitatively and\nqualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI\ndata.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12099v1) |\n| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal\n  execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huy\u00ean Pham |   Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and\nconstraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity\nmarkets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general\npropagator model under linear functional inequality constraints. The optimal\ncontrol is given explicitly in terms of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers\nand their conditional expectations, as a solution to a linear stochastic\nFredholm equation. We propose a stochastic version of the Uzawa algorithm on\nthe dual problem to construct the stochastic Lagrange multipliers numerically\nvia a stochastic projected gradient ascent, combined with a least-squares Monte\nCarlo regression step to approximate their conditional expectations. We\nillustrate our findings on two different practical applications with stochastic\nsignals: (i) an optimal execution problem with an exponential or a power law\ndecaying transient impact, with either a `no-shorting' constraint in the\npresence of a `sell' signal, a `no-buying' constraint in the presence of a\n`buy' signal or a stochastic `stop-trading' constraint whenever the exogenous\nprice drops below a specified reference level; (ii) a battery storage problem\nwith instantaneous operating costs, seasonal signals and fixed constraints on\nboth the charging power and the load capacity of the battery.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12098v1) |\n| Skill matching at scale: freelancer-project alignment for efficient\n  multilingual candidate retrieval | Warren Jouanneau, Marc Palyart, Emma Jouffroy |   Finding the perfect match between a job proposal and a set of freelancers is\nnot an easy task to perform at scale, especially in multiple languages.

The task of\nnext-best-view (NBV) planning is to infer the pose of the next viewpoint based\non the current data, and gradually realize the complete three-dimensional\nreconstruction. Many existing algorithms, however, suffer a large computational\nburden due to the use of ray-casting. To address this, this paper proposes a\nprojection-based NBV planning framework. It can select the next best view at an\nextremely fast speed while ensuring the complete scanning of the object.\nSpecifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into\nellipsoids based on the voxel structure.Then, the next best view is selected\nfrom the candidate views using a projection-based viewpoint quality evaluation\nfunction in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy. This process\nreplaces the ray-casting in voxel structures, significantly improving the\ncomputational efficiency. Comparative experiments with other algorithms in a\nsimulation environment show that the framework proposed in this paper can\nachieve 10 times efficiency improvement on the basis of capturing roughly the\nsame coverage. The real-world experimental results also prove the efficiency\nand feasibility of the framework.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12096v1) |\n| Undersampling effects on observed periods of coronal oscillations | Daye Lim, Tom Van Doorsselaere, Valery M. Nakariakov, Dmitrii Y. Kolotkov, Yuhang Gao, David Berghmans |   Context. Recent observations of decayless transverse oscillations have shown\ntwo branches in the relationship between periods and loop lengths. One is a\nlinear relationship, interpreted as a standing mode. The other shows almost no\ncorrelation and has not yet been interpreted conclusively. Aims. We\ninvestigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless\noscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely\nfollow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations\nare standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations\nwhere the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase\nare randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal\nby considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of\ntelescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast\nFourier transform. Results. When the sampling cadence is getting closer to the\nactual oscillation period, a tendency for overestimating periods in short loops\nis enhanced. The relationship between loop lengths and periods of the sampled\nsignals shows the two branches as in the observation. Conclusions. We find that\nlong periods of decayless oscillations occurring in short loops could be the\nresult of undersampling.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12095v1) |\n| Enwrapped Perylene Bisimide Enables Room Temperature Polariton Lasing\n  and Photonic Lattices | Dominik Horneber, Johannes D\u00fcreth, Tim Schembri, Simon Betzold, Matthias Stolte, Sven H\u00f6fling, Frank W\u00fcrthner, Sebastian Klembt |   Perylene bisimides (PBIs) are organic dyes with photoluminescence quantum\nyields (PLQY) close to unity in solution and great thermal and photo-chemical\nstability. These features alongside the tunability of their solid-state packing\narrangement via chemical functionalization make this material class an\nexcellent candidate for exciton-polariton lasing at room temperature. Polariton\nlasing is well understood in III-V semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures,\nhowever, the search for emitter materials for robust and versatile room\ntemperature applications is ongoing. While e.g. perovskites and several organic\nmaterials have been identified to support polariton lasing, many of these\nmaterials lack tunability and long-term stability under ambient conditions.\nHere, we fabricate optical microcavities using a strongly enwrapped PBI\nchromophore with prevailing monomer-like absorption and emission properties in\nthe solid state. Voluminous bay-substituents prevent stacking induced\nPLQY-quenching, thereby enabling polariton lasing at room temperature.\nAdditionally, photonic confinement in single hemispheric resonators is\ndemonstrated leading to localized polaritonic modes with discrete energies, as\nwell as optical lattices revealing distinct polaritonic band-structures. Due to\nthe possibility of tunable properties by the precise control of the solid-state\npacking arrangement of PBI emitters, our results pave the way for\npolarization-dependent light-matter coupling, including topological photonic\neffects within oriented crystalline thin-film microcavity structures.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12093v1) |\n| IMRL: Integrating Visual, Physical, Temporal, and Geometric\n  Representations for Enhanced Food Acquisition | Rui Liu, Zahiruddin Mahammad, Amisha Bhaskar, Pratap Tokekar |   Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality\nof life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse\nfood items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents\nunique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric\ninformation (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g.,\ncolor, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially\nwhen foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance.\nWe employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition.\nExisting methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy\nbased on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, such\nrepresentations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse\nacquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\napproach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which\nintegrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance\nthe robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach\ncaptures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular,\nliquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and\nintroduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and\nassess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies\nbased on context, improving the robot's capability to handle diverse food\nacquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach's\nrobustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations,\nincluding zero-shot generalization to unseen settings.

Motivated by recent experiments which achieved\nunprecedented fast growth of large-size high-quality 2D crystals on liquid\nsubstrates, we uncover novel effects of liquid surfaces on microstructural\nordering. We find that substrate fluctuations generate short-ranged noise that\nspeeds up crystallization and grain growth of the overlayer, surpassing that of\nfree-standing system. Coupling to the liquid substrate fluctuations can also\nmodulate local randomness, leading to intriguing disordered structures with\nhidden spatial order, i.e., disordered hyperuniformity.

To navigate such environments,\nagents benefit from information on the various elements (e.g., buttons, text,\nor images) present. It remains unclear which element attributes have the\ngreatest impact on agent performance, especially in environments that only\nprovide a graphical representation (i.e., pixels). Here we find that the\nordering in which elements are presented to the language model is surprisingly\nimpactful--randomizing element ordering in a webpage degrades agent performance\ncomparably to removing all visible text from an agent's state representation.\nWhile a webpage provides a hierarchical ordering of elements, there is no such\nordering when parsing elements directly from pixels. Moreover, as tasks become\nmore challenging and models more sophisticated, our experiments suggest that\nthe impact of ordering increases. Finding an effective ordering is non-trivial.\nWe investigate the impact of various element ordering methods in web and\ndesktop environments. We find that dimensionality reduction provides a viable\nordering for pixel-only environments. We train a UI element detection model to\nderive elements from pixels and apply our findings to an agent\nbenchmark--OmniACT--where we only have access to pixels.

We estimate separately\nthe magnitude of the various contributions of nucleons, Delta baryons, pions as\nwell as further hadrons and resonances. The uncertainty in the parametrization\nof the probability density to find a quark inside a nucleon is spanned by\nassuming that at zero temperature the transition density to Quarkyonic Matter\nis between one and three times that of nuclear matter.

Agyeman, Jinfeng Liu, Sirish L. Shah |   Efficient water management in agriculture is important for mitigating the\ngrowing freshwater scarcity crisis. Mixed-integer Model Predictive Control\n(MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex\nscheduling problems in agricultural irrigation. However, the computational\ncomplexity of mixed-integer MPC still poses a significant challenge,\nparticularly in large-scale applications. This study proposes an approach to\nenhance the computational efficiency of mixed-integer MPC-based irrigation\nschedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture\ndynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed-integer linear\nrepresentation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the\nmixed-integer MPC-based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a\nmixed-integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed-integer\nnonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global\noptimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated\nthrough comparative studies conducted on a large-scale agricultural field\nacross two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models,\nspecifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used\ntriggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU-based approach significantly\nreduces solution times -- by up to 99.5\\% -- while achieving comparable\nperformance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water\nUse Efficiency (IWUE).

Current computational methods rely on the assumption that\nthe binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible,\nas conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon\nbinding.

Importantly,\nwhile any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but\nnot all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all\nfour data sets, suggesting high generalizability.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12078v1) |\n| Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Via Data Pruning | Andrea Napoli, Paul White |   The removal of carefully-selected examples from training data has recently\nemerged as an effective way of improving the robustness of machine learning\nmodels. However, the best way to select these examples remains an open\nquestion. In this paper, we consider the problem from the perspective of\nunsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). We propose AdaPrune, a method for UDA\nwhereby training examples are removed to attempt to align the training\ndistribution to that of the target data. By adopting the maximum mean\ndiscrepancy (MMD) as the criterion for alignment, the problem can be neatly\nformulated and solved as an integer quadratic program. We evaluate our approach\non a real-world domain shift task of bioacoustic event detection. As a method\nfor UDA, we show that AdaPrune outperforms related techniques, and is\ncomplementary to other UDA algorithms such as CORAL. Our analysis of the\nrelationship between the MMD and model accuracy, along with t-SNE plots,\nvalidate the proposed method as a principled and well-founded way of performing\ndata pruning.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12076v1) |\n| The elastica sling | Alessandro Cazzolli, Francesco Dal Corso |   The nonlinear mechanics of a flexible elastic rod constrained at its edges by\na pair of sliding sleeves is analyzed. The planar equilibrium configurations of\nthis variable-length elastica are found to have shape defined only by the\ninclination of the two constraints, while their distance is responsible only\nfor scaling the size. By extending the theoretical stability criterion\navailable for systems under isoperimetric constraints to the case of variable\ndomains, the existence of no more than one stable equilibrium solution is\nrevealed. The set of sliding sleeves' inclination pairs for which the stability\nis lost are identified. Such critical conditions allow the indefinite ejection\nof the flexible rod from the sliding sleeves, thus realizing an elastica sling.\nFinally, the theoretical findings are validated by experiments on a physical\nprototype. The present results lead to a novel actuation principle that may\nfind application as a mechanism in energy harvesting, wave mitigation devices,\nand soft robotic locomotion.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12075v1) |\n| Online Refractive Camera Model Calibration in Visual Inertial Odometry | Mohit Singh, Kostas Alexis |   This paper presents a general refractive camera model and online\nco-estimation of odometry and the refractive index of unknown media. This\nenables operation in diverse and varying refractive fluids, given only the\ncamera calibration in air. The refractive index is estimated online as a state\nvariable of a monocular visual-inertial odometry framework in an iterative\nformulation using the proposed camera model. The method was verified on data\ncollected using an underwater robot traversing inside a pool. The evaluations\ndemonstrate convergence to the ideal refractive index for water despite\nsignificant perturbations in the initialization. Simultaneously, the approach\nenables on-par visual-inertial odometry performance in refractive media without\nprior knowledge of the refractive index or requirement of medium-specific\ncamera calibration.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12074v1) |\n| Influence of dislocations in multilayer graphene stacks: A phase field\n  crystal study | K. R. Elder, Zhi-Feng Huang, T. Ala-Nissila |   In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene\nstacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a\nrecently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems\nincorporating out-of-plane deformations and parameterized to match to density\nfunctional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems. The\nspecific configuration considered consists of one monolayer containing four\n$5|7$ dislocations (i.e., two dislocation dipoles) sandwiched in between\nperfect graphene layers. The study reveals how the strain field from the\ndislocations in the defected layer leads to out-of-plane deformations that in\nturn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are\nmade for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a\ndefect-free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and\nsystem size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by\nroughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence\nacross the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height\nprofiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12073v1) |\n| PAD-FT: A Lightweight Defense for Backdoor Attacks via Data Purification\n  and Fine-Tuning | Yukai Xu, Yujie Gu, Kouichi Sakurai |   Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks,\nparticularly as recent advancements have led to increasingly subtle\nimplantation, making the defense more challenging. Existing defense mechanisms\ntypically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and\ninvolve retraining an auxiliary model or fine-tuning the entire victim model.\nHowever, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always\nfeasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and\nlightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD-FT, that does not require an\nadditional clean dataset and fine-tunes only a very small part of the model to\ndisinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a\nsimple data purification process to identify and select the most-likely clean\ndata from the poisoned training dataset. The self-purified clean dataset is\nthen used for activation clipping and fine-tuning only the last classification\nlayer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation\nclipping, and classifier fine-tuning, our mechanism PAD-FT demonstrates\nsuperior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as\nconfirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12072v1) |\n| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing\n  data in Irish sagas | P. MacCarron |   For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts\nin order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify\nsimilarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the\nsignificance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture\nrequires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and\noften impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the\nnetwork of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that\nthe top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent\nwith central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has\nbeen lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust\nto a large random removal of edges.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12071v1) |\n| The repetition threshold for ternary rich words | James D. Currie, Lucas Mol, Jarkko Peltom\u00e4ki |   In 2014, Vesti proposed the problem of determining the repetition threshold\nfor infinite rich words, i.e., for infinite words in which all factors of\nlength $n$ contain $n$ distinct nonempty palindromic factors. In 2020, Currie,\nMol, and Rampersad proved a conjecture of Baranwal and Shallit that the\nrepetition threshold for binary rich words is $2 + \\sqrt{2}/2$. In this paper,\nwe prove a structure theorem for $16/7$-power-free ternary rich words. Using\nthe structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich\nwords is $1 + 1/(3 - \\mu) \\approx 2.25876324$, where $\\mu$ is the unique real\nroot of the polynomial $x^3 - 2x^2 - 1$.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12068v1) |\n| Fitting Multilevel Factor Models | Tetiana Parshakova, Trevor Hastie, Stephen Boyd |   We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance\ngiven by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~\\cite{parshakova2023factor}. We\ndevelop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM)\nalgorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of\nthe observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and\nmaintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved\nthrough a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive\ndefinite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of an invertible PSD MLR matrix\nis also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the\nrecursive Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of\nthe inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky\nfactorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities,\nyielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement. This paper is\naccompanied by an open-source package that implements the proposed methods.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12067v1) |\n| Drifts of the sub-stellar points of the TRAPPIST-1 planets | Revol Alexandre, \u00c9meline Bolmont, Mariana Sastre, Gabriel Tobie, Anne-Sophie Libert, Mathilde Kervazo, Sergi Blanco-Cuaresma |   Accurate modeling of tidal interactions is crucial for interpreting recent\nJWST observations of the thermal emissions of TRAPPIST-1~b and c and for\ncharacterizing the surface conditions and potential habitability of the other\nplanets in the system. Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by\ntidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to\ntheir proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the\nTRAPPIST-1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In\nthis work, we present the recent implementation of the co-planar tidal torque\nand forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N-body code\nPosidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using\na tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of\neach planet by taking into account their multi-layer internal structure\ncomputed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets\nare not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state.\nPlanet-planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and\ntides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a\nresult, the sub-stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and\nlong-timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with\nperiods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12065v1) |\n| Quantum Magic and Multi-Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei | Florian Br\u00f6kemeier, S. Momme Hengstenberg, James W. T. Keeble, Caroline E. P. Robin, Federico Rocco, Martin J. Savage |   Motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the\nquantum complexity of $p$-shell and $sd$-shell nuclei. Valence-space nuclear\nshell-model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit\nregisters using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$-shell and 24\nqubits for the $sd$-shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement\n($n$-tangles) and magic (non-stabilizerness) are determined. While exact\nevaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of\nactive nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex\nnuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique\nis introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed\nnuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\\sim 8$ for some\nnuclei. Significant multi-nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$-shell,\ndominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of\nmagic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on\nthe path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion.\nThese results indicate that quantum-computing resources will accelerate\nprecision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12064v1) |\n| Post-Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a\n  massive, rotating object | Lorenzo Iorio |   The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the\ngeneral relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring\ncomponents of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are\nanalytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level. To the Newtonian\norder, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as\nwell. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation\nin space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the\nprimary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first\nto 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system\nalong an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred\nclose to the Sun's flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due\nto the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of\nmicroarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for\nthe post-Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)\nspacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of\nthe latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current\n(formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would\nbring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the\npredicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not\nchanged by any of the post--Keplerian accelerations considered. The\ncalculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any\nalternative models of gravity as well.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12063v1) |\n| Generalized Robot Learning Framework | Jiahuan Yan, Zhouyang Hong, Yu Zhao, Yu Tian, Yunxin Liu, Travis Davies, Luhui Hu |   Imitation based robot learning has recently gained significant attention in\nthe robotics field due to its theoretical potential for transferability and\ngeneralizability. However, it remains notoriously costly, both in terms of\nhardware and data collection, and deploying it in real-world environments\ndemands meticulous setup of robots and precise experimental conditions. In this\npaper, we present a low-cost robot learning framework that is both easily\nreproducible and transferable to various robots and environments. We\ndemonstrate that deployable imitation learning can be successfully applied even\nto industrial-grade robots, not just expensive collaborative robotic arms.\nFurthermore, our results show that multi-task robot learning is achievable with\nsimple network architectures and fewer demonstrations than previously thought\nnecessary. As the current evaluating method is almost subjective when it comes\nto real-world manipulation tasks, we propose Voting Positive Rate (VPR) - a\nnovel evaluation strategy that provides a more objective assessment of\nperformance. We conduct an extensive comparison of success rates across various\nself-designed tasks to validate our approach. To foster collaboration and\nsupport the robot learning community, we have open-sourced all relevant\ndatasets and model checkpoints, available at huggingface.co/ZhiChengAI.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12061v1) |\n| PARAPHRASUS : A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Paraphrase\n  Detection Models | Andrianos Michail, Simon Clematide, Juri Opitz |   The task of determining whether two texts are paraphrases has long been a\nchallenge in NLP. However, the prevailing notion of paraphrase is often quite\nsimplistic, offering only a limited view of the vast spectrum of paraphrase\nphenomena. Indeed, we find that evaluating models in a paraphrase dataset can\nleave uncertainty about their true semantic understanding. To alleviate this,\nwe release paraphrasus, a benchmark designed for multi-dimensional assessment\nof paraphrase detection models and finer model selection. We find that\nparaphrase detection models under a fine-grained evaluation lens exhibit\ntrade-offs that cannot be captured through a single classification dataset.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12060v1) |\n| Dual-Layer Training and Decoding of Large Language Model with\n  Simultaneously Thinking and Speaking | Ningyuan Xi, Xiaoyu Wang, Yetao Wu, Teng Chen, Qingqing Gu, Jinxian Qu, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong Chen, Luo Ji |   Large Language Model can reasonably understand and generate human expressions\nbut may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have\nbeen several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but\nmost of them are not data-driven or training-based. In this paper, we are\nmotivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel\nmodel architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts\nand then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines\nto annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt-response samples, then\nadd language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We\ntrain the language model by the thoughts-augmented data and successfully let\nthe thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally\noutput more reasonable responses. Both qualitative examples and quantitative\nresults validate the effectiveness and performance of TaS.

Using this\nframework and through experiments, explanations on the response of a neural\nnetwork are given by pointing out the output classes that are easily reachable\nfrom a given input.

To address these\nconcerns, recent research has focused on developing zero-knowledge machine\nlearning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of\nML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have\nsubstantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily\noptimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the\nsubstantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the\nmodel and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new\nCommit-and-Prove SNARK (CP-SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that\neffectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML\npipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white-box use of the\nunderlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic\npolynomial commitment and only makes black-box use of the proof system. As a\nresult, Artemis is compatible with state-of-the-art proof systems without\ntrusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP-SNARKs, evaluate\ntheir performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial\nimprovements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover\ncosts and maintaining efficiency even for large-scale models. For example, for\nthe VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from\n11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML\ntowards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and\ncomplex ML models.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12055v1) |\n| MMP for Enriques pairs and singular Enriques varieties | Francesco Antonio Denisi, \u00c1ngel David R\u00edos Ortiz, Nikolaos Tsakanikas, Zhixin Xie |   We introduce and study the class of primitive Enriques varieties, whose\nsmooth members are Enriques manifolds. We provide several examples and we\ndemonstrate that this class is stable under the operations of the Minimal Model\nProgram (MMP). In particular, given an Enriques manifold $Y$ and an effective\n$\\mathbb{R}$-divisor $B_Y$ on $Y$ such that the pair $(Y,B_Y)$ is log\ncanonical, we prove that any $(K_Y+B_Y)$-MMP terminates with a minimal model\n$(Y',B_{Y'})$ of $(Y,B_Y)$, where $Y'$ is a $\\mathbb{Q}$-factorial primitive\nEnriques variety with canonical singularities. Finally, we investigate the\nasymptotic theory of Enriques manifolds.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12054v1) |\n| Numerical renormalization group calculations for magnetic impurity\n  systems with spin-orbit coupling and crystal-field effects | Aitor Calvo-Fern\u00e1ndez, Mar\u00eda Blanco-Rey, Asier Eiguren |   Exploiting symmetries in the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method\nsignificantly enhances performance by improving accuracy, increasing\ncomputational speed, and optimizing memory efficiency. Published codes focus on\ncontinuous rotations and unitary groups, which generally are not applicable to\nsystems with strong crystal-field effects. The PointGroupNRG code implements\nsymmetries related to discrete rotation groups, which are defined by the user\nin terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, together with particle conservation\nand spin rotation symmetries. In this paper we present a new version of the\ncode that extends the available finite groups, previously limited to simply\nreducible point groups, in a way that all point and double groups become\naccessible. It also includes the full spin-orbital rotation group. Moreover, to\nimprove the code's flexibility for impurities with complex interactions, this\nnew version allows to choose between a standard Anderson Hamiltonian for the\nimpurity or, as another novel feature, an ionic model that requires only the\nspectrum and the impurity Lehmann amplitudes.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12050v1) |\n| Quantum-like nonlinear interferometry with frequency-engineered\n  classical light | Romain Dalidet, Anthony Martin, Gr\u00e9gory Sauder, Laurent Labont\u00e9, S\u00e9bastien Tanzilli |   Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic\nentanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits. Nonlinear\noptics has served as a workhorse for the generation of entangled photon pairs,\nensuring both energy and phase conservation, but at the cost of limited rate\nand degraded signal-to-noise ratio compared to laser-based interferometry\napproaches. We present a \"quantum-like\" nonlinear optical method that reaches\nsuper-resolution in single-photon detection regime. This is achieved by\nreplacing photon-pairs by coherent states of light, mimicking quantum\nproperties through classical nonlinear optics processes. Our scheme utilizes\ntwo high-brightness lasers. This results in a substantially greater\nsignal-to-noise ratio compared to its quantum counterpart. Such an approach\npaves the way to significantly reduced acquisition times, providing a pathway\nto explore signals across a broader range of bandwidth. The need to increase\nthe frequency bandwidth of the quantum sensor significantly motivates the\npotential applications of this pathway.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12049v1) |\n| A Survey-Based Quantitative Analysis of Stress Factors and Their Impacts\n  Among Cybersecurity Professionals | Sunil Arora, John D. Hastings |   This study investigates the prevalence and underlying causes of work-related\nstress and burnout among cybersecurity professionals using a quantitative\nsurvey approach guided by the Job Demands-Resources model. Analysis of\nresponses from 50 cybersecurity practitioners reveals an alarming reality: 44%\nreport experiencing severe work-related stress and burnout, while an additional\n28% are uncertain about their condition. The demanding nature of cybersecurity\nroles, unrealistic expectations, and unsupportive organizational cultures\nemerge as primary factors fueling this crisis. Notably, 66% of respondents\nperceive cybersecurity jobs as more stressful than other IT positions, with 84%\nfacing additional challenges due to the pandemic and recent high-profile\nbreaches. The study finds that most cybersecurity experts are reluctant to\nreport their struggles to management, perpetuating a cycle of silence and\nneglect. To address this critical issue, the paper recommends that\norganizations foster supportive work environments, implement mindfulness\nprograms, and address systemic challenges. By prioritizing the mental health of\ncybersecurity professionals, organizations can cultivate a more resilient and\neffective workforce to protect against an ever-evolving threat landscape.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12047v1) |\n| Using Large Language Models to Generate Clinical Trial Tables and\n  Figures | Yumeng Yang, Peter Krusche, Kristyn Pantoja, Cheng Shi, Ethan Ludmir, Kirk Roberts, Gen Zhu |   Tables, figures, and listings (TFLs) are essential tools for summarizing\nclinical trial data.

While most approaches in the Safe\nReinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and\nrobot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them\nin complex real-world settings. Instead, model-based approaches that\nincorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning\nframework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on\nthe real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot\ndynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task-specific and hard\nto obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to\ncompute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long-term safety\nrequirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe\nexploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus\non ensuring long-term safety and handling of uncertainty.

Martins, Federico Carollo, Kay Brandner, Igor Lesanovsky |   Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by\nfast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an\nequilibrium-like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet-Magnus\nHamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi's golden rule, we show\nthat such Floquet-Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated\nRydberg atomic systems, whose lab-frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function\nof time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the\nsystem, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which\nis necessary to uphold high-lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To\ncorroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five\ninteracting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate\nnumerically that the second-order Floquet-Gibbs state of this system is\nessentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding\nRedfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently\nlarge.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12044v1) |\n| Understanding the Effects of the Baidu-ULTR Logging Policy on Two-Tower\n  Models | Morris de Haan, Philipp Hager |   Despite the popularity of the two-tower model for unbiased learning to rank\n(ULTR) tasks, recent work suggests that it suffers from a major limitation that\ncould lead to its collapse in industry applications: the problem of logging\npolicy confounding.

This paper bridges the gap between\ntheory and practice by investigating the confounding problem on the largest\nreal-world dataset, Baidu-ULTR. Our main contributions are threefold: 1) we\nshow that the conditions for the confounding problem are given on Baidu-ULTR,\n2) the confounding problem bears no significant effect on the two-tower model,\nand 3) we point to a potential mismatch between expert annotations, the golden\nstandard in ULTR, and user click behavior.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12043v1) |\n| ASR Benchmarking: Need for a More Representative Conversational Dataset | Gaurav Maheshwari, Dmitry Ivanov, Th\u00e9o Johannet, Kevin El Haddad |   Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable\nperformance on widely used benchmarks such as LibriSpeech and Fleurs.

This will allow users to easily access the original papers for further reading and verification. Consider adding a column for the URL in the markdown table.\n\n2. **Keyword Specification:**\n   - The plan mentions using \"relevant keywords\" for searching papers. It would be beneficial to specify which keywords will be used to ensure a focused search. For example, keywords like \"Large Language Models,\" \"GPT,\" \"transformers,\" etc., could be included.\n\n3. **Domain Categorization:**\n   - While the plan mentions categorizing papers by domain, it would be helpful to define the specific domains that will be included in the table. This will provide clarity and ensure consistency in categorization.\n\n4. **Data Extraction Details:**\n   - The plan could benefit from specifying how the scientist will determine the domain of application for each paper. Will this be based on the abstract, keywords, or another method? Providing clarity on this process will enhance the reliability of the categorization.\n\n5. **Review Process:**\n   - The review process is a good step, but it might be useful to include a checklist of criteria for the scientist to use when reviewing the markdown table. This could include checking for completeness, accuracy of information, and proper formatting.\n\n6. **Timeline:**\n   - Consider adding a timeline for each step of the process.

However, current methods often require hundreds to\nthousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual\nobservations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual\nrepresentations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or\ntrained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present\nDynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual\nrepresentations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a\nlatent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of\nimage embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without\naugmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.\nImportantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet\ndatasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real\nenvironments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly\nimprove downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised\nlearning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo\nhold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,\nand nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and\nmeasure its impact on downstream policy performance.

Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,\nwhich enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions\ninto different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to\ngenerate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning\nwith human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary\nPosition Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional\ninformation across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for\nprocessing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception\ncapabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL\ninvestigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By\nscaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the\namount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive\nperformance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to\nleading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal\nbenchmarks, outperforming other generalist models.

BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses\nand 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance\nof deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to\nintegrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and\nperformance. However, widely-used C++-based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,\ng$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries\nlike PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of\ndebugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we\nintroduce an eager-mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,\nproviding PyTorch-compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach\nincludes GPU-accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for\n2nd-order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear\nsolvers.

Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby\npeople can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene-aware social\ntransformer model (SAST) to forecast long-term (10s) human motion motion.\nUnlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely\nvarying numbers of people and objects in a scene.

Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon |   Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a\nperfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from\nfundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\\mu$-distortion) to late-time\nbaryonic feedback processes (y-distortion). While the y-distortion can be\ndetected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the\n$\\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude\nsmaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a\nserious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\\mu$\narises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the\nprimordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \\approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here,\nwe present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly\ndetecting $\\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but\nwith an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we\noptimize the instrument's configuration to target $\\mu$ while robustly\nmarginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike\nFourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their\nindividual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing\nsignificant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the\n$\\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\\mu$-distortion at $\\approx 5\\sigma$ (10$\\sigma$)\nassuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission\nduration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized\nconfiguration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular\nresolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally\nmeasure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic\ncorrection at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total\nthermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12188v1) |\n| Exoplanet accretion monitoring spectroscopic survey (ENTROPY) I.\n  Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary-mass\n  object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C.

We obtained the first high-resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target\nwith VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near-UV to visible wavelengths (3200-6800\nAA). We report resolved H3-H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.\nBased on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+-1\nkm/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR\nexcess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of\nthe parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+-63 K and radius to 1.5+-0.1\nRj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet-surface shock model\nimplies a pre-shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,-40) km/s and a pre-shock\ndensity of log(n0/cm^-3)=14(+0,-5). Pre-shock velocity points to a mass of\n6(+8,-4) Mj for the target.

Xu |   The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our\nlocal solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions\nit exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong\ndynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).\nConsequently, it is likely that there are large-scale physical structures\nwithin the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we\npresent new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\n(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a\nmulti-wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the\nM0.8$-$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring-like morphology. We\nestimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring to be 79\"\nand 154\", respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre\ndistance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $> 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, a\nmass of $\\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\\odot$, and an expansion speed of $\\sim$ 20 km\ns$^{-1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($> 10^{51}$ erg) and\nmomentum ($> 10^7$ M$_\\odot$ km s$^{-1}$). We discuss several possible causes\nfor the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback\nand large-scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the\nM0.8$-$0.2 ring is a single high-energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain\nthe observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have\ntaken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which\nwe now see as the M0.8$-$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an\nextreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12185v1) |\n| To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic\n  reasoning | Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett |   Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting\nreasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of\ntasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted\na quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own\nevaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives\nstrong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with\nmuch smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the\nanswer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the\nquestion or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic\noperations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of\nCoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing\nagainst tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic\nexecution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our\nresults indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance\nwhile saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond\nprompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation\nacross the whole range of LLM applications.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183v1) |\n| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs | Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T. Chiu, Siyu Ren, Fei Yuan, Wenting Zhao, Zhiyong Wu, Alexander M. Rush |   Broad textual understanding and in-context learning require language models\nthat utilize full document contexts. Due to the implementation challenges\nassociated with directly training long-context models, many methods have been\nproposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to\ndifferences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these\napproaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long-context\nperformance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a\ncontrolled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation,\nutilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several\ninsights into long-context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of\nperplexity as a general-purpose performance indicator even in longer-context\ntasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods\nsystematically underperform across long-context tasks.

Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate\ninformation that conflicts with real-world facts, and their persuasive style\ncan make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result,\nend-users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with\nthe accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all\noutputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore\nsupervised finetuning on uncertainty-augmented predictions as a method to\ndevelop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty.\nSpecifically, we measure the calibration of pre-trained models and then\nfine-tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of\nuncertainty. Through experiments on various question-answering datasets, we\ndemonstrate that LLMs are well-calibrated in assessing their predictions, and\nsupervised finetuning based on the model's own confidence leads to\nwell-calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single-claim\nanswers.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12180v1) |\n| Computational Dynamical Systems | Jordan Cotler, Semon Rezchikov |   We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite-dimensional\ndynamical systems.

Subsequently, we\nshow that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable\none-dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and\nmoreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt.\nMore broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one 'machine' to simulate\nanother, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low-complexity 'encoders' and\n'decoders' to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system\nbeing simulated.

PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering\na fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of\npartially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL\nis the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large\nimprovement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,\nbased on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.\n(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should\nuse PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence\nalso reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a\nshortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that\nthe comparison of log-likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al. (2023) is\nflawed because their PAL calculations were carried out using a dataset scaled\ndifferently from the previous study. If PAL and the particle filter are applied\nto the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears. On simulations\nwhere the model is correctly specified, the particle filter outperforms PAL.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12173v1) |\n| You Only Read Once (YORO): Learning to Internalize Database Knowledge\n  for Text-to-SQL | Hideo Kobayashi, Wuwei Lan, Peng Shi, Shuaichen Chang, Jiang Guo, Henghui Zhu, Zhiguo Wang, Patrick Ng |   While significant progress has been made on the text-to-SQL task, recent\nsolutions repeatedly encode the same database schema for every question,\nresulting in unnecessary high inference cost and often overlooking crucial\ndatabase knowledge. To address these issues, we propose You Only Read Once\n(YORO), a novel paradigm that directly internalizes database knowledge into the\nparametric knowledge of a text-to-SQL model during training and eliminates the\nneed for schema encoding during inference. YORO significantly reduces the input\ntoken length by 66%-98%. Despite its shorter inputs, our empirical results\ndemonstrate YORO's competitive performances with traditional systems on three\nbenchmarks as well as its significant outperformance on large databases.\nFurthermore, YORO excels in handling questions with challenging value\nretrievals such as abbreviation.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12172v1) |\n| Ergodic properties of infinite extension of symmetric interval exchange\n  transformations | Przemys\u0142aw Berk, Frank Trujillo, Hao Wu |   We prove that skew products with the cocycle given by the function\n$f(x)=a(x-1/2)$ with $a\\neq 0$ are ergodic for every ergodic symmetric IET in\nthe base, thus giving the full characterization of ergodic extensions in this\nfamily.

However,\ndue to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across\ndifferent MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In\nthis study, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework, multiPI-TransBTS,\nwhich integrates multi-physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.\nThe model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi-modal\nimaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor\ncharacteristics. The multiPI-TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an\nAdaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi-source, multi-scale feature\ndecoder. The encoder incorporates a multi-branch architecture to separately\nextract modality-specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module\nfuses information from multiple sources using channel-wise and element-wise\nattention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both\ncommon and task-specific features through a Task-Specific Feature Introduction\n(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),\nTumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on\nthe BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nmultiPI-TransBTS over the state-of-the-art methods. The model consistently\nachieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,\nhighlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results\nalso indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision\nand recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a\nsignificant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving\nclinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12167v1) |\n| Synchrotron self-Compton in a radiative-adiabatic fireball scenario:\n  Modelling the multiwavelength observations in some Fermi/LAT bursts | Nissim Fraija, P. Veres, B. Betancourt Kamenetskaia, A. Galvan-Gamez, M. G. Dainotti, Simone Dichiara, R. L. Becerra |   Energetic GeV photons expected from the closest and the most energetic\nGamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provide an unique opportunity to study the\nvery-high-energy emission as well as the possible correlations with lower\nenergy bands in realistic GRB afterglow models. In the standard GRB afterglow\nmodel, the relativistic homogeneous shock is usually considered to be fully\nadiabatic, however, it could be partially radiative. Based on the external\nforward-shock scenario in both stellar wind and constant-density medium. We\npresent a radiative-adiabatic analytical model of the synchrotron self-Compton\n(SSC) and synchrotron processes considering an electron energy distribution\nwith a power-law index of 1 < p < 2 and 2 $\\leq$ p. We show that the SSC\nscenario plays a relevant role in the radiative parameter $\\epsilon$, leading\nto a prolonged evolution during the slow cooling regime. In a particular case,\nwe derive the Fermi/LAT light curves together with the photons with energies\n$\\geq$ 100 MeV in a sample of nine bursts from the second Fermi/LAT GRB catalog\nthat exhibited temporal and spectral indices with $\\geq$ 1.5 and $\\approx$ 2,\nrespectively. These events can hardly be described with closure relations of\nthe standard synchrotron afterglow model, and also exhibit energetic photons\nabove the synchrotron limit. We have modeled the multi-wavelength observations\nof our sample to constrain the microphysical parameters, the circumburst\ndensity, the bulk Lorentz factor and the mechanism responsible for explaining\nthe energetic GeV photons.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12166v1) |\n| Blind Deconvolution on Graphs: Exact and Stable Recovery | Chang Ye, Gonzalo Mateos |   We study a blind deconvolution problem on graphs, which arises in the context\nof localizing a few sources that diffuse over networks. While the observations\nare bilinear functions of the unknown graph filter coefficients and sparse\ninput signals, a mild requirement on invertibility of the diffusion filter\nenables an efficient convex relaxation leading to a linear programming\nformulation that can be tackled with off-the-shelf solvers. Under the\nBernoulli-Gaussian model for the inputs, we derive sufficient exact recovery\nconditions in the noise-free setting. A stable recovery result is then\nestablished, ensuring the estimation error remains manageable even when the\nobservations are corrupted by a small amount of noise. Numerical tests with\nsynthetic and real-world network data illustrate the merits of the proposed\nalgorithm, its robustness to noise as well as the benefits of leveraging\nmultiple signals to aid the (blind) localization of sources of diffusion. At a\nfundamental level, the results presented here broaden the scope of classical\nblind deconvolution of (spatio-)temporal signals to irregular graph domains.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12164v1) |\n| Generalized compression and compressive search of large datasets | Morgan E. Prior, Thomas Howard III, Emily Light, Najib Ishaq, Noah M. Daniels |   The Big Data explosion has necessitated the development of search algorithms\nthat scale sub-linearly in time and memory.\n  While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently,\nfew algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain-specific.\n  We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to\nperform $k$-NN and $\\rho$-NN search on compressed data while only decompressing\na small, relevant, portion of the data.\n  panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low-dimensional\nstructure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.\n  panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between\ntwo points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in\nterms of the other.\n  This property holds for many widely-used distance functions, e.g. string edit\ndistances (Levenshtein, Needleman-Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures\n(Jaccard, Dice, etc.).\n  We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic,\nand set data.\n  We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the\ncompressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.\n  panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering\nsub-linear time performance for $k$-NN and $\\rho$-NN search.\n  We conclude that panCAKES is an efficient, general-purpose algorithm for\nexact compressive search on large datasets that obey the manifold hypothesis.\n  We provide an open-source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming\nlanguage.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12161v1) |\n| WeHelp: A Shared Autonomy System for Wheelchair Users | Abulikemu Abuduweili, Alice Wu, Tianhao Wei, Weiye Zhao |   There is a large population of wheelchair users. Most of the wheelchair users\nneed help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs\nare not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this\nproject, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair\nusers. A robot with a WeHelp system has three modes, following mode, remote\ncontrol mode and tele-operation mode. In the following mode, the robot follows\nthe wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can\nask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the\nwheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech\nrecognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode.\nIn the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy\nstick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs,\nsuch as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high\nshelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant\ntakes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks\nfor their needs. Our evaluation shows that the pipeline is useful and practical\nfor wheelchair users.

These IFSs\nexhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are\ntopologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the\nBlonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave\nsuperconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients\nincluding thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and\nexamine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage\nand temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of\n$d$-wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the\nnormal-superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric\nresponse. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in\nSeebeck coefficient ($\\sim 200\\,\\mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($\\sim 3.5$) due to the\ngeneration of the IFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for\ndevice applications.

Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker\nidentity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a NeRF-based network. Since we train our network on\nmonocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn\ndisentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio\nfeatures in a self-supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects.\nBy incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned\naudio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle\nmotion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer-based architecture\nthat learns expression features, capturing long-range facial expressions and\ndisentangling them from the speech-specific mouth movements. Through\nquantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can\nsynthesize high-fidelity talking face videos, achieving state-of-the-art facial\nexpression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12156v1) |\n| Autopet III challenge: Incorporating anatomical knowledge into nnUNet\n  for lesion segmentation in PET/CT | Hamza Kalisch, Fabian H\u00f6rst, Ken Herrmann, Jens Kleesiek, Constantin Seibold |   Lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging is essential for precise tumor\ncharacterization, which supports personalized treatment planning and enhances\ndiagnostic precision in oncology. However, accurate manual segmentation of\nlesions is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. Given the\nrising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods,\nparticularly deep-learning-based approaches, have become increasingly more\nrelevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation\nof tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting,\naddressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable\nsolutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET\nchallenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers\n(FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers. To this extent, we developed a\nclassifier that identifies the tracer of the given PET/CT based on the Maximum\nIntensity Projection of the PET scan. We trained two individual\nnnUNet-ensembles for each tracer where anatomical labels are included as a\nmulti-label task to enhance the model's performance.

However, a\nrobot's ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if\nnaively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach-avoid\ndynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a\nsafety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human's behavior\nas goal-driven but conditioned on the robot's plan, enabling us to capture\ninfluence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical\nand belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in\nhuman behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE\n(Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high-dimensional\n(39-D) simulated human-robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline\ngame-theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust\nbaseline that treats the human as a worst-case adversary, a safety controller\nthat does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy-function-based\nsafety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage\nthe influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing\nthe robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate\nduring task execution.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12153v1) |\n| Decoding Style: Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Image-Guided Outfit\n  Recommendation with Preference | Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan |   Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding\nboth fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper\npresents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their \"black box\" and static\nnature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item\nvisual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a\nMultimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style\nand color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis\nfor personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the\nopen-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability\nto recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative\nexamples is employed to enhance the LLM's decision-making process. This creates\na self-enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in\nline with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore\ndataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill-in-the-blank,\nand complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework's\nability to generate stylish, trend-aligned outfit suggestions, continuously\nimproving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our\nproposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more\ncohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the\nproposed framework's potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate\nsuggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit\ngeneration.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12150v1) |\n| Mechanical Wannier-Stark Ladder of Diamond Spin-Mechanical Lamb Wave\n  Resonators | Philip Andrango, Hailin Wang |   We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier-Stark ladders of\ndiamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with\nultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin\nproperties. Three nearest-neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric\nconfigurations and a large range of coupling rates have been explored for the\nrealization of Wannier-Stark ladders of LWRs, potentially enabling long-range\nconnectivity between spin qubits through their interactions with mechanical\nvibrations.

While these improve performance, they often reach a\nsaturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated\nfeedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key\nchallenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can\nover-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and\naddress errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to\nidentify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding\nhow many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too\nsoon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose\nMAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty\nas easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard\nones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error\nlocalization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores.\nMoreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with\nthree agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on\nstep-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure\nsufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating\nfurther rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5\nand show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of\nMAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by\n4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with\nbaselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our\nablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe's RMs and multi-agent\ncommunication.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147v1) |\n| Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka |   Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string\nprocessing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into\nblocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence\nof a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another\noccurrence earlier in $T$. Due to numerous applications, LZ77 factorization is\none of the most studied problems on strings. In the 47 years since its\ninception, several algorithms were developed for different models of\ncomputation, including parallel, GPU, external-memory, and quantum. Remarkably,\nhowever, the complexity of the most basic variant is still not settled: All\nexisting algorithms in the RAM model run in $\\Omega(n)$ time, which is a\n$\\Theta(\\log n)$ factor away from the lower bound of $\\Omega(n/\\log n)$\n(following from the necessity to read the input, which takes $\\Theta(n/\\log n)$\nspace for $T\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}$).\n  We present the first $o(n)$-time algorithm for LZ77 factorization, breaking\nthe linear-time barrier present for nearly 50 years. For $T\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}$, our\nalgorithm runs in $\\mathcal{O}(n/\\sqrt{\\log n})=o(n)$ time and uses the optimal\n$\\mathcal{O}(n/\\log n)$ working space. Our algorithm generalizes to\n$\\Sigma=[0..\\sigma)$, where $\\sigma=n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The runtime and\nworking space then become $\\mathcal{O}((n\\log\\sigma)/\\sqrt{\\log n})$ and\n$\\mathcal{O}(n/\\log_{\\sigma} n)$. To obtain our algorithm, we prove a more\ngeneral result: For any constant $\\epsilon\\in(0,1)$ and $T\\in[0..\\sigma)^{n}$,\nin $\\mathcal{O}((n\\log\\sigma)/\\sqrt{\\log n})$ time and using\n$\\mathcal{O}(n/\\log_{\\sigma}n)$ space, we can construct an\n$\\mathcal{O}(n/\\log_{\\sigma}n)$-size index that, given any $P=T[j..j+\\ell)$\n(represented as $(j,\\ell)$), computes the leftmost occurrence of $P$ in $T$ in\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log^{\\epsilon}n)$ time.

An emerging and\npromising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractive\nsummarization methods. Despite the plethora of studies in this domain, research\non the combined methodology remains scarce, particularly in the context of\nVietnamese language processing. This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDS\nframework leveraging a two-component pipeline architecture that integrates\nextractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs an\nextractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This is\nachieved by a modification of the pre-trained BERT network, which derives\nsemantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet network\nstructures. The second component utilizes the VBD-LLaMA2-7B-50b model for\nabstractive summarization, ultimately generating the final summary document.\nOur proposed framework demonstrates a positive performance, attaining ROUGE-2\nscores of 39.6% on the VN-MDS dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art\nbaselines.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12134v1) |\n| Einstein-dilaton-four-Maxwell Holographic Anisotropic Models | Irina Ya. Aref'eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov |   In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the\nfive-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell models has played a crucial role.\nTypically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while\nadditional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A\nmore general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field\nrepresents spatial longitudinal-transverse anisotropy, while the third and\nfourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We\nconsider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero\ntemperature and five functions at non-zero temperature. Maxwell field related\nto the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,\nwhereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.\nWe demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of\nthe seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations -- either the\ndilaton or the vector potential equation -- follows from the Einstein equations\nand the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi\nidentity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress-energy\ntensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is\nprovided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to\nthree Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis\nshows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein\nequations and the equation for the vector potential\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12131v1) |\n| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components\n  for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco-Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram |   Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data\ntogether with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal\ncomponents used. It is therefore important to determine the number of\nsignificant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a\nvariational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for\nestimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of\nsamples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This\neliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of\nprincipal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.\nThis framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows\nand columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),\nand with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data\nwith arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as\ncultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our\nmethod on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may\nunderestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the\nsynthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical\ndataset. These results suggest that it is broadly applicable across the life\nsciences.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12129v1) |\n| Linguini: A benchmark for language-agnostic linguistic reasoning | Eduardo S\u00e1nchez, Belen Alastruey, Christophe Ropers, Pontus Stenetorp, Mikel Artetxe, Marta R. Costa-juss\u00e0 |   We propose a new benchmark to measure a language model's linguistic reasoning\nskills without relying on pre-existing language-specific knowledge. The test\ncovers 894 questions grouped in 160 problems across 75 (mostly) extremely\nlow-resource languages, extracted from the International Linguistic Olympiad\ncorpus. To attain high accuracy on this benchmark, models don't need previous\nknowledge of the tested language, as all the information needed to solve the\nlinguistic puzzle is presented in the context. We find that, while all analyzed\nmodels rank below 25% accuracy, there is a significant gap between open and\nclosed models, with the best-performing proprietary model at 24.05% and the\nbest-performing open model at 8.84%.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12126v1) |\n| From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the\n  primordial black hole reheating scenario | Guillem Dom\u00e8nech, Jan Tr\u00e4nkle |   We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs\noriginate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight\nPBHs with masses $M\\lesssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat\nit via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate\nwhether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH\nreheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the\ninitial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer\nfunctions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and\nisocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation\nof state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH\ndominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the\nspectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive\nto $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density\nfluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance\nas a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\nobservations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the\ninitial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we\nfind that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several\nfuture GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas,\nespecially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any\nearly matter-dominated universe scenario.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12125v1) |\n| Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules | Anqi Zhang, Wilson S. Geisler |   Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We\ninvestigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented\ndisplays having well-separated potential target-object locations. Performance\nwas compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption\nthat the information from the different potential target locations is\nstatistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than\noptimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the\nimplausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show\nthat three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical\nresults. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near\noptimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the\ncentral potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise\ncauses search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These\nfindings have far-reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks\nand other identification tasks in humans and other animals.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12124v1) |\n| Far-from-equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann\n  approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows\n  $v_n$ | Vincenzo Nugara, Vincenzo Greco, Salvatore Plumari |   We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal\nsystem in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution\nfunction and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system\nsizes $R$ and interaction strength $\\eta/s$ and identify universality classes\nbased upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each\nof this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $\\hat\n\\gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results\nhighlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum\nmoments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to\na 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of\ndifferent sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a\nsimilar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse\nflow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system\nsize and $\\eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and\ntheir response functions, along with the impact of the $\\eta/s$ and the system\ntransverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in\nmomentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow\n$v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of\nlarge opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems\nevolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play\nin this process.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12123v1) |\n| Qwen2.5-Math Technical Report: Toward Mathematical Expert Model via\n  Self-Improvement | An Yang, Beichen Zhang, Binyuan Hui, Bofei Gao, Bowen Yu, Chengpeng Li, Dayiheng Liu, Jianhong Tu, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin, Keming Lu, Mingfeng Xue, Runji Lin, Tianyu Liu, Xingzhang Ren, Zhenru Zhang |   In this report, we present a series of math-specific large language models:\nQwen2.5-Math and Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct-1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the\nQwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self-improvement\nthroughout the entire pipeline, from pre-training and post-training to\ninference: (1) During the pre-training phase, Qwen2-Math-Instruct is utilized\nto generate large-scale, high-quality mathematical data. (2) In the\npost-training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive\nsampling from Qwen2-Math-Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative\nevolution of data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model,\nit's possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the\nnext round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the\nultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct.\n(3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling,\noptimizing the model's performance.\n  Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced\nmathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and\nTool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics\ndatasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and\nAIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math\ncompetition problems.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12122v1) |\n| Computing the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two-Dimensional\n  Strongly-Correlated Systems | Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn |   We show that the two-dimensional $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time-reversal\ninvariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary-condition\ndependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non-interacting and\nstrongly-correlated insulators. By introducing a family of quasi-single\nparticle states associated to the many-body ground state of an insulator, we\nshow that the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant can be expressed as the integral of a\ncertain Berry connection over half the space of boundary conditions, providing\nan alternative expression to the formulations that appear in [Lee et al., Phys.\nRev.

We show the equivalence of the\ndifferent many-body formulations of the invariant, and show how they reduce to\nknown band-theoretic results for Slater determinant ground states. Finally, we\napply our results to analytically calculate the invariant for the Kane-Mele\nmodel with nonlocal (orbital) Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) interactions. This\nrigorously establishes the topological nontriviality of the Kane-Mele model\nwith HK interactions, and represents one of the few exact calculations of the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a strongly-interacting system.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12120v1) |\n| Weak Lensing analysis of Abell 2390 using short exposures | A.

Sembroski |   We present a weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 2390 at z =\n0.23 using second moment shape measurements made in 411 short 60s exposures.\nThe exposures are obtained in three broadband photometric filters (g, r, i)\nusing WIYN-ODI. Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a\nmoment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching\nalgorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The\nmeasurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight\nto obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim\nsimulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find\nthe mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We\nalso find the E-Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic\nstructures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical\nand X-Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to\nmap large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of\nthe cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the\npeaks are similar to X-Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster\nand show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12119v1) |\n| Low Frame-rate Speech Codec: a Codec Designed for Fast High-quality\n  Speech LLM Training and Inference | Edresson Casanova, Ryan Langman, Paarth Neekhara, Shehzeen Hussain, Jason Li, Subhankar Ghosh, Ante Juki\u0107, Sang-gil Lee |   Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing\nthrough audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the\napplication of language modeling techniques to audio data.

Through a series of case studies,\nwe find that the common practice of omitting baselines or comparing against a\nweak baseline model (e.g. a linear model with no optimization) obscures the\nvalue of ML methods proposed in the research literature. Using these insights,\nwe propose some best practices that will enable practitioners to more\neffectively study and deploy ML models in clinical settings.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12116v1) |\n| Revisiting Dark Photon Constraints from CMB Spectral Distortions | Jens Chluba, Bryce Cyr, Matthew C. Johnson |   Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide\nstringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post-BBN (Big\nBang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models\nwith COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.\nHere, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark\nphoton conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous\nworks only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the\nchange to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon\ndistortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the\ndistortion has an opposite sign and a $\\simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We\nfurthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover\nthe redshift range $\\simeq 2\\times 10^6-4\\times 10^7$ between the $\\mu$-era and\nthe end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints\nfor dark photon masses in the range $10^{-4}\\,{\\rm eV}\\lesssim m_{\\rm\ndp}\\lesssim 10^{-3}\\,{\\rm eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We\ndemonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon\nto dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $\\mu$-type distortion\nindependent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study\ndark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with\nCMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12115v1) |\n| Bi-objective trail-planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous\n  environment | Cory M. Simon, Jeffrey Richley, Lucas Overbey, Darleen Perez-Lavin |   Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in\nresource delivery, patrolling, information-gathering, agriculture, forest fire\nfighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and\nsearch-and-rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments -- with e.g.\nrough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or\ncapturing robots -- should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of\nrisks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should\ntake the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the\nteam-level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward\nfrom visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider\nbi-objective trail-planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a\nhazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed\ngraph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of\nsurvival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a\nrobot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for\nthe Pareto-optimal robot-team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team\nobjectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive\nthe mission. A human decision-maker can then select trail plans that balance,\naccording to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony\noptimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto-optimal set of\nrobot team trail plans.

We demonstrate that strategic\ndata reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing\nbandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies\nMinimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource-constrained\nenvironments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient\npractices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and\noverprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for\noptimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data\nrepresentation. An experimental methodology demonstrates effective acoustic\ndata characterization after downsampling, quantization, and truncation to\nsimulate reduced-fidelity sensors and network and storage constraints; results\nshows that performance can be maintained up to 95\\% with sample rates reduced\nby 75\\% and bit depths and clip length reduced by 50\\% which translates into\nsubstantial cost and resource reduction. These findings have implications on\nthe design and development of constrained systems.

Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a\npowerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,\ncomplex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in\nperformance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and\nits innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer\nknowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact\nand efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application\nacross various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and\nhistorical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are\nhighlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational\nefficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical\ndeployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of\nKD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the\nbreadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case\nstudies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,\nsuch as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review\ndiscusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical\nconstraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive\noverview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS. Through this\norganization, the paper not only elucidates the current state of research in KD\nbut also sets the stage for future research opportunities, thereby contributing\nsignificantly to both academic research and real-world applications.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12111v1) |\n| It depends: Varieties of defining growth dependence | Anja Janischewski, Katharina Bohnenberger, Matthias Kranke, Tobias Vogel, Riwan Driouich, Tobias Froese, Stefanie Gerold, Raphael Kaufmann, Lorenz Key\u00dfer, Jannis Niethammer, Christopher Olk, Matthias Schmelzer, Asl\u0131 Y\u00fcr\u00fck, Steffen Lange |   Many socio-economic systems require positive economic growth rates to\nfunction properly. Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing\nevidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,\nthese growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,\nmore and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth-dependent systems\nand develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of\n'growth dependence' still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,\nwhich impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article\nproposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the\nconcept of 'growth dependence' across socio-economic systems. We provide a\ngeneral definition consisting of four components that can be specified for\ndifferent empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of\nmeasurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions\nor properties of the system under investigation. According to our general\ndefinition, a socio-economic system is growth-dependent if it requires a\nlong-term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to\nmaintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen\nnormative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to\nthree areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:\nemployment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies\ndemonstrate that whether or not a system is growth-dependent hinges not only on\nthe empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of\nthe concept of growth dependence.

Computer-assisted Surgery systems\nhave played a crucial role in improving the precision and safety of ESD\nprocedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognition\nof surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesion\ncharacteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real-time\nsurgical phase recognition algorithms. Existing surgical phase recognition\nalgorithms struggle to efficiently capture temporal contexts in video-based\nscenarios, leading to insufficient performance. To address these issues, we\npropose SPRMamba, a novel Mamba-based framework for ESD surgical phase\nrecognition. SPRMamba leverages the strengths of Mamba for long-term temporal\nmodeling while introducing the Scaled Residual TranMamba block to enhance the\ncapture of fine-grained details, overcoming the limitations of traditional\ntemporal models like Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformers.\nMoreover, a Temporal Sample Strategy is introduced to accelerate the\nprocessing, which is essential for real-time phase recognition in clinical\nsettings.

Then, extending GPV to LLM\nvalue measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometric\nmethodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free-form\noutputs, enabling context-specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis of\nmeasurement paradigms, indicating response biases of prior methods; and 3) an\nattempt to bridge LLM values and their safety, revealing the predictive power\nof different value systems and the impacts of various values on LLM safety.\nThrough interdisciplinary efforts, we aim to leverage AI for next-generation\npsychometrics and psychometrics for value-aligned AI.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12106v1) |\n| FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated\n  Long-Tailed Learning | Xiuhua Lu, Peng Li, Xuefeng Jiang |   Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy\nin distributed machine learning. However, datasets distributed across each\nclient in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can\nbe globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly\naffects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated\nlearning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it\nfails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data.\nThis results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting\nthe equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a\nmethodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,\nwe propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the\nlocal training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred\noptimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state-of-the-art\nmethods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed\ndistribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10-LT and\nCIFAR-100-LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of\nmodel performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long-tailed\ndistribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12105v1) |\n| Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error\n  Detection | Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia |   Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications.

However,\nachieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require\nfault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant\nimplementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection\ncode. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the\nalgorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with\nup to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we\npropose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance, and use it\nto characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance\nto future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our\nmodel can be used to determine necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform\nGoemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware. Our results demonstrate the\nlargest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially\nfault-tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date,\npaving the way towards solving real-world applications with quantum computers.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12104v1) |\n| Cyclicity Analysis of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process | Vivek Kaushik |   In this thesis, we consider an $N$-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)\nprocess satisfying the linear stochastic differential equation $d\\mathbf x(t) =\n- \\mathbf B\\mathbf x(t) dt + \\boldsymbol \\Sigma d \\mathbf w(t).$ Here, $\\mathbf\nB$ is a fixed $N \\times N$ circulant friction matrix whose eigenvalues have\npositive real parts, $\\boldsymbol \\Sigma$ is a fixed $N \\times M$ matrix. We\nconsider a signal propagation model governed by this OU process. In this model,\nan underlying signal propagates throughout a network consisting of $N$ linked\nsensors located in space. We interpret the $n$-th component of the OU process\nas the measurement of the propagating effect made by the $n$-th sensor. The\nmatrix $\\mathbf B$ represents the sensor network structure: if $\\mathbf B$ has\nfirst row $(b_1 \\ , \\ \\dots \\ , \\ b_N),$ where $b_1>0$ and $b_2 \\ , \\ \\dots \\\n,\\ b_N \\le 0,$ then the magnitude of $b_p$ quantifies how receptive the $n$-th\nsensor is to activity within the $(n+p-1)$-th sensor. Finally, the $(m,n)$-th\nentry of the matrix $\\mathbf D = \\frac{\\boldsymbol \\Sigma \\boldsymbol\n\\Sigma^\\text T}{2}$ is the covariance of the component noises injected into the\n$m$-th and $n$-th sensors. For different choices of $\\mathbf B$ and\n$\\boldsymbol \\Sigma,$ we investigate whether Cyclicity Analysis enables us to\nrecover the structure of network. Roughly speaking, Cyclicity Analysis studies\nthe lead-lag dynamics pertaining to the components of a multivariate signal. We\nspecifically consider an $N \\times N$ skew-symmetric matrix $\\mathbf Q,$ known\nas the lead matrix, in which the sign of its $(m,n)$-th entry captures the\nlead-lag relationship between the $m$-th and $n$-th component OU processes. We\ninvestigate whether the structure of the leading eigenvector of $\\mathbf Q,$\nthe eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of $\\mathbf Q$ in\nmodulus, reflects the network structure induced by $\\mathbf B.$\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12102v1) |\n| Symmetry-Enriched Learning: A Category-Theoretic Framework for Robust\n  Machine Learning Models | Ronald Katende |   This manuscript presents a novel framework that integrates higher-order\nsymmetries and category theory into machine learning.

Recently, this\ncuriosity has motivated the fMRI-to-image reconstruction task; given the fMRI\ndata from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual\nstimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent\nDiffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex\nvisual stimuli such as high-resolution natural images from vision datasets.\nDespite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often\nlack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.\nConsequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere\nvisuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs\neffectively incorporate multi-modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,\nand image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image\ngenerations. Specifically, inspired by the two-streams hypothesis suggesting\nthat perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain\nregions, our framework, Brain-Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain\nregions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from\nsemantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information\nregions, Brain-Streams provides accurate multi-modal guidance to LDMs. We\nvalidate the reconstruction ability of Brain-Streams both quantitatively and\nqualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI\ndata.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12099v1) |\n| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal\n  execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huy\u00ean Pham |   Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and\nconstraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity\nmarkets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general\npropagator model under linear functional inequality constraints. The optimal\ncontrol is given explicitly in terms of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers\nand their conditional expectations, as a solution to a linear stochastic\nFredholm equation. We propose a stochastic version of the Uzawa algorithm on\nthe dual problem to construct the stochastic Lagrange multipliers numerically\nvia a stochastic projected gradient ascent, combined with a least-squares Monte\nCarlo regression step to approximate their conditional expectations. We\nillustrate our findings on two different practical applications with stochastic\nsignals: (i) an optimal execution problem with an exponential or a power law\ndecaying transient impact, with either a `no-shorting' constraint in the\npresence of a `sell' signal, a `no-buying' constraint in the presence of a\n`buy' signal or a stochastic `stop-trading' constraint whenever the exogenous\nprice drops below a specified reference level; (ii) a battery storage problem\nwith instantaneous operating costs, seasonal signals and fixed constraints on\nboth the charging power and the load capacity of the battery.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12098v1) |\n| Skill matching at scale: freelancer-project alignment for efficient\n  multilingual candidate retrieval | Warren Jouanneau, Marc Palyart, Emma Jouffroy |   Finding the perfect match between a job proposal and a set of freelancers is\nnot an easy task to perform at scale, especially in multiple languages. In this\npaper, we propose a novel neural retriever architecture that tackles this\nproblem in a multilingual setting.

The\nlatter are used as backbone for a custom transformer architecture that aims to\nkeep the structure of the profiles and project. This model is trained with a\ncontrastive loss on historical data.

The task of\nnext-best-view (NBV) planning is to infer the pose of the next viewpoint based\non the current data, and gradually realize the complete three-dimensional\nreconstruction. Many existing algorithms, however, suffer a large computational\nburden due to the use of ray-casting. To address this, this paper proposes a\nprojection-based NBV planning framework. It can select the next best view at an\nextremely fast speed while ensuring the complete scanning of the object.\nSpecifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into\nellipsoids based on the voxel structure.Then, the next best view is selected\nfrom the candidate views using a projection-based viewpoint quality evaluation\nfunction in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy. This process\nreplaces the ray-casting in voxel structures, significantly improving the\ncomputational efficiency. Comparative experiments with other algorithms in a\nsimulation environment show that the framework proposed in this paper can\nachieve 10 times efficiency improvement on the basis of capturing roughly the\nsame coverage. The real-world experimental results also prove the efficiency\nand feasibility of the framework.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12096v1) |\n| Undersampling effects on observed periods of coronal oscillations | Daye Lim, Tom Van Doorsselaere, Valery M. Nakariakov, Dmitrii Y. Kolotkov, Yuhang Gao, David Berghmans |   Context. Recent observations of decayless transverse oscillations have shown\ntwo branches in the relationship between periods and loop lengths. One is a\nlinear relationship, interpreted as a standing mode. The other shows almost no\ncorrelation and has not yet been interpreted conclusively. Aims. We\ninvestigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless\noscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely\nfollow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations\nare standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations\nwhere the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase\nare randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal\nby considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of\ntelescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast\nFourier transform. Results. When the sampling cadence is getting closer to the\nactual oscillation period, a tendency for overestimating periods in short loops\nis enhanced. The relationship between loop lengths and periods of the sampled\nsignals shows the two branches as in the observation. Conclusions. We find that\nlong periods of decayless oscillations occurring in short loops could be the\nresult of undersampling.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12095v1) |\n| Enwrapped Perylene Bisimide Enables Room Temperature Polariton Lasing\n  and Photonic Lattices | Dominik Horneber, Johannes D\u00fcreth, Tim Schembri, Simon Betzold, Matthias Stolte, Sven H\u00f6fling, Frank W\u00fcrthner, Sebastian Klembt |   Perylene bisimides (PBIs) are organic dyes with photoluminescence quantum\nyields (PLQY) close to unity in solution and great thermal and photo-chemical\nstability. These features alongside the tunability of their solid-state packing\narrangement via chemical functionalization make this material class an\nexcellent candidate for exciton-polariton lasing at room temperature. Polariton\nlasing is well understood in III-V semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures,\nhowever, the search for emitter materials for robust and versatile room\ntemperature applications is ongoing. While e.g. perovskites and several organic\nmaterials have been identified to support polariton lasing, many of these\nmaterials lack tunability and long-term stability under ambient conditions.\nHere, we fabricate optical microcavities using a strongly enwrapped PBI\nchromophore with prevailing monomer-like absorption and emission properties in\nthe solid state. Voluminous bay-substituents prevent stacking induced\nPLQY-quenching, thereby enabling polariton lasing at room temperature.\nAdditionally, photonic confinement in single hemispheric resonators is\ndemonstrated leading to localized polaritonic modes with discrete energies, as\nwell as optical lattices revealing distinct polaritonic band-structures. Due to\nthe possibility of tunable properties by the precise control of the solid-state\npacking arrangement of PBI emitters, our results pave the way for\npolarization-dependent light-matter coupling, including topological photonic\neffects within oriented crystalline thin-film microcavity structures.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12093v1) |\n| IMRL: Integrating Visual, Physical, Temporal, and Geometric\n  Representations for Enhanced Food Acquisition | Rui Liu, Zahiruddin Mahammad, Amisha Bhaskar, Pratap Tokekar |   Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality\nof life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse\nfood items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents\nunique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric\ninformation (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g.,\ncolor, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially\nwhen foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance.\nWe employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition.\nExisting methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy\nbased on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, such\nrepresentations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse\nacquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\napproach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which\nintegrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance\nthe robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach\ncaptures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular,\nliquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and\nintroduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and\nassess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies\nbased on context, improving the robot's capability to handle diverse food\nacquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach's\nrobustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations,\nincluding zero-shot generalization to unseen settings.

Motivated by recent experiments which achieved\nunprecedented fast growth of large-size high-quality 2D crystals on liquid\nsubstrates, we uncover novel effects of liquid surfaces on microstructural\nordering. We find that substrate fluctuations generate short-ranged noise that\nspeeds up crystallization and grain growth of the overlayer, surpassing that of\nfree-standing system. Coupling to the liquid substrate fluctuations can also\nmodulate local randomness, leading to intriguing disordered structures with\nhidden spatial order, i.e., disordered hyperuniformity. These results reveal\nthe physical mechanisms underlying the fast growth of 2D crystals on liquid\nsurfaces and demonstrate a novel strategy for synthesizing disordered\nhyperuniform thin film structures.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12090v1) |\n| The Impact of Element Ordering on LM Agent Performance | Wayne Chi, Ameet Talwalkar, Chris Donahue |   There has been a surge of interest in language model agents that can navigate\nvirtual environments such as the web or desktop. To navigate such environments,\nagents benefit from information on the various elements (e.g., buttons, text,\nor images) present. It remains unclear which element attributes have the\ngreatest impact on agent performance, especially in environments that only\nprovide a graphical representation (i.e., pixels). Here we find that the\nordering in which elements are presented to the language model is surprisingly\nimpactful--randomizing element ordering in a webpage degrades agent performance\ncomparably to removing all visible text from an agent's state representation.\nWhile a webpage provides a hierarchical ordering of elements, there is no such\nordering when parsing elements directly from pixels. Moreover, as tasks become\nmore challenging and models more sophisticated, our experiments suggest that\nthe impact of ordering increases. Finding an effective ordering is non-trivial.\nWe investigate the impact of various element ordering methods in web and\ndesktop environments. We find that dimensionality reduction provides a viable\nordering for pixel-only environments. We train a UI element detection model to\nderive elements from pixels and apply our findings to an agent\nbenchmark--OmniACT--where we only have access to pixels.

At zero temperature for baryon chemical potentials below\nthe mass of the Lambda baryon, only nucleons contribute to the quark density.\nThis is different at finite temperature, where all baryons, mesons and their\nresonances can be excited and thus add quarks to the phase space. The\nprobability density to find a quark inside a hadron is determined using the\nYukawa ansatz of the IdylliQ model of Quarkyonic Matter. We estimate separately\nthe magnitude of the various contributions of nucleons, Delta baryons, pions as\nwell as further hadrons and resonances. The uncertainty in the parametrization\nof the probability density to find a quark inside a nucleon is spanned by\nassuming that at zero temperature the transition density to Quarkyonic Matter\nis between one and three times that of nuclear matter. Various predictions for\na possible critical point associated with the chiral phase transition are found\nclose to a triple point at which the line of the deconfinement transition and\nthe curve associated with the transition to Quarkyonic Matter intersect.

Agyeman, Jinfeng Liu, Sirish L. Shah |   Efficient water management in agriculture is important for mitigating the\ngrowing freshwater scarcity crisis. Mixed-integer Model Predictive Control\n(MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex\nscheduling problems in agricultural irrigation. However, the computational\ncomplexity of mixed-integer MPC still poses a significant challenge,\nparticularly in large-scale applications. This study proposes an approach to\nenhance the computational efficiency of mixed-integer MPC-based irrigation\nschedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture\ndynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed-integer linear\nrepresentation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the\nmixed-integer MPC-based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a\nmixed-integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed-integer\nnonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global\noptimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated\nthrough comparative studies conducted on a large-scale agricultural field\nacross two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models,\nspecifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used\ntriggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU-based approach significantly\nreduces solution times -- by up to 99.5\\% -- while achieving comparable\nperformance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water\nUse Efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, the ReLU-based approach maintains enhanced\nperformance in terms of total prescribed irrigation and IWUE compared to the\nwidely-used triggered irrigation scheduling method.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12082v1) |\n| Design of Ligand-Binding Proteins with Atomic Flow Matching | Junqi Liu, Shaoning Li, Chence Shi, Zhi Yang, Jian Tang |   Designing novel proteins that bind to small molecules is a long-standing\nchallenge in computational biology, with applications in developing catalysts,\nbiosensors, and more. Current computational methods rely on the assumption that\nthe binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible,\nas conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon\nbinding. In this work, we formulate proteins and molecules as unified\nbiotokens, and present AtomFlow, a novel deep generative model under the\nflow-matching framework for the design of ligand-binding proteins from the 2D\ntarget molecular graph alone. Operating on representative atoms of biotokens,\nAtomFlow captures the flexibility of ligands and generates ligand conformations\nand protein backbone structures iteratively.

Existing defense mechanisms\ntypically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and\ninvolve retraining an auxiliary model or fine-tuning the entire victim model.\nHowever, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always\nfeasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and\nlightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD-FT, that does not require an\nadditional clean dataset and fine-tunes only a very small part of the model to\ndisinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a\nsimple data purification process to identify and select the most-likely clean\ndata from the poisoned training dataset. The self-purified clean dataset is\nthen used for activation clipping and fine-tuning only the last classification\nlayer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation\nclipping, and classifier fine-tuning, our mechanism PAD-FT demonstrates\nsuperior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as\nconfirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12072v1) |\n| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing\n  data in Irish sagas | P. MacCarron |   For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts\nin order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify\nsimilarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the\nsignificance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture\nrequires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and\noften impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the\nnetwork of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that\nthe top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent\nwith central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has\nbeen lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust\nto a large random removal of edges.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12071v1) |\n| The repetition threshold for ternary rich words | James D. Currie, Lucas Mol, Jarkko Peltom\u00e4ki |   In 2014, Vesti proposed the problem of determining the repetition threshold\nfor infinite rich words, i.e., for infinite words in which all factors of\nlength $n$ contain $n$ distinct nonempty palindromic factors. In 2020, Currie,\nMol, and Rampersad proved a conjecture of Baranwal and Shallit that the\nrepetition threshold for binary rich words is $2 + \\sqrt{2}/2$. In this paper,\nwe prove a structure theorem for $16/7$-power-free ternary rich words. Using\nthe structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich\nwords is $1 + 1/(3 - \\mu) \\approx 2.25876324$, where $\\mu$ is the unique real\nroot of the polynomial $x^3 - 2x^2 - 1$.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12068v1) |\n| Fitting Multilevel Factor Models | Tetiana Parshakova, Trevor Hastie, Stephen Boyd |   We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance\ngiven by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~\\cite{parshakova2023factor}. We\ndevelop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM)\nalgorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of\nthe observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and\nmaintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved\nthrough a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive\ndefinite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of an invertible PSD MLR matrix\nis also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the\nrecursive Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of\nthe inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky\nfactorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities,\nyielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement.

Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by\ntidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to\ntheir proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the\nTRAPPIST-1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In\nthis work, we present the recent implementation of the co-planar tidal torque\nand forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N-body code\nPosidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using\na tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of\neach planet by taking into account their multi-layer internal structure\ncomputed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets\nare not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state.\nPlanet-planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and\ntides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a\nresult, the sub-stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and\nlong-timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with\nperiods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12065v1) |\n| Quantum Magic and Multi-Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei | Florian Br\u00f6kemeier, S. Momme Hengstenberg, James W. T. Keeble, Caroline E. P. Robin, Federico Rocco, Martin J. Savage |   Motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the\nquantum complexity of $p$-shell and $sd$-shell nuclei. Valence-space nuclear\nshell-model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit\nregisters using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$-shell and 24\nqubits for the $sd$-shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement\n($n$-tangles) and magic (non-stabilizerness) are determined. While exact\nevaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of\nactive nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex\nnuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique\nis introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed\nnuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\\sim 8$ for some\nnuclei. Significant multi-nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$-shell,\ndominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of\nmagic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on\nthe path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion.\nThese results indicate that quantum-computing resources will accelerate\nprecision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12064v1) |\n| Post-Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a\n  massive, rotating object | Lorenzo Iorio |   The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the\ngeneral relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring\ncomponents of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are\nanalytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level. To the Newtonian\norder, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as\nwell. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation\nin space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the\nprimary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first\nto 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system\nalong an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred\nclose to the Sun's flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due\nto the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of\nmicroarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for\nthe post-Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)\nspacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of\nthe latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current\n(formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would\nbring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the\npredicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not\nchanged by any of the post--Keplerian accelerations considered. The\ncalculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any\nalternative models of gravity as well.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12063v1) |\n| Generalized Robot Learning Framework | Jiahuan Yan, Zhouyang Hong, Yu Zhao, Yu Tian, Yunxin Liu, Travis Davies, Luhui Hu |   Imitation based robot learning has recently gained significant attention in\nthe robotics field due to its theoretical potential for transferability and\ngeneralizability. However, it remains notoriously costly, both in terms of\nhardware and data collection, and deploying it in real-world environments\ndemands meticulous setup of robots and precise experimental conditions. In this\npaper, we present a low-cost robot learning framework that is both easily\nreproducible and transferable to various robots and environments. We\ndemonstrate that deployable imitation learning can be successfully applied even\nto industrial-grade robots, not just expensive collaborative robotic arms.\nFurthermore, our results show that multi-task robot learning is achievable with\nsimple network architectures and fewer demonstrations than previously thought\nnecessary. As the current evaluating method is almost subjective when it comes\nto real-world manipulation tasks, we propose Voting Positive Rate (VPR) - a\nnovel evaluation strategy that provides a more objective assessment of\nperformance. We conduct an extensive comparison of success rates across various\nself-designed tasks to validate our approach. To foster collaboration and\nsupport the robot learning community, we have open-sourced all relevant\ndatasets and model checkpoints, available at huggingface.co/ZhiChengAI.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12061v1) |\n| PARAPHRASUS : A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Paraphrase\n  Detection Models | Andrianos Michail, Simon Clematide, Juri Opitz |   The task of determining whether two texts are paraphrases has long been a\nchallenge in NLP. However, the prevailing notion of paraphrase is often quite\nsimplistic, offering only a limited view of the vast spectrum of paraphrase\nphenomena. Indeed, we find that evaluating models in a paraphrase dataset can\nleave uncertainty about their true semantic understanding. To alleviate this,\nwe release paraphrasus, a benchmark designed for multi-dimensional assessment\nof paraphrase detection models and finer model selection. We find that\nparaphrase detection models under a fine-grained evaluation lens exhibit\ntrade-offs that cannot be captured through a single classification dataset.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12060v1) |\n| Dual-Layer Training and Decoding of Large Language Model with\n  Simultaneously Thinking and Speaking | Ningyuan Xi, Xiaoyu Wang, Yetao Wu, Teng Chen, Qingqing Gu, Jinxian Qu, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong Chen, Luo Ji |   Large Language Model can reasonably understand and generate human expressions\nbut may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have\nbeen several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but\nmost of them are not data-driven or training-based. In this paper, we are\nmotivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel\nmodel architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts\nand then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines\nto annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt-response samples, then\nadd language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We\ntrain the language model by the thoughts-augmented data and successfully let\nthe thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally\noutput more reasonable responses. Both qualitative examples and quantitative\nresults validate the effectiveness and performance of TaS.

Using this\nframework and through experiments, explanations on the response of a neural\nnetwork are given by pointing out the output classes that are easily reachable\nfrom a given input.

To address these\nconcerns, recent research has focused on developing zero-knowledge machine\nlearning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of\nML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have\nsubstantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily\noptimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the\nsubstantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the\nmodel and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new\nCommit-and-Prove SNARK (CP-SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that\neffectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML\npipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white-box use of the\nunderlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic\npolynomial commitment and only makes black-box use of the proof system. As a\nresult, Artemis is compatible with state-of-the-art proof systems without\ntrusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP-SNARKs, evaluate\ntheir performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial\nimprovements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover\ncosts and maintaining efficiency even for large-scale models. For example, for\nthe VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from\n11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML\ntowards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and\ncomplex ML models.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12055v1) |\n| MMP for Enriques pairs and singular Enriques varieties | Francesco Antonio Denisi, \u00c1ngel David R\u00edos Ortiz, Nikolaos Tsakanikas, Zhixin Xie |   We introduce and study the class of primitive Enriques varieties, whose\nsmooth members are Enriques manifolds. We provide several examples and we\ndemonstrate that this class is stable under the operations of the Minimal Model\nProgram (MMP). In particular, given an Enriques manifold $Y$ and an effective\n$\\mathbb{R}$-divisor $B_Y$ on $Y$ such that the pair $(Y,B_Y)$ is log\ncanonical, we prove that any $(K_Y+B_Y)$-MMP terminates with a minimal model\n$(Y',B_{Y'})$ of $(Y,B_Y)$, where $Y'$ is a $\\mathbb{Q}$-factorial primitive\nEnriques variety with canonical singularities. Finally, we investigate the\nasymptotic theory of Enriques manifolds.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12054v1) |\n| Numerical renormalization group calculations for magnetic impurity\n  systems with spin-orbit coupling and crystal-field effects | Aitor Calvo-Fern\u00e1ndez, Mar\u00eda Blanco-Rey, Asier Eiguren |   Exploiting symmetries in the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method\nsignificantly enhances performance by improving accuracy, increasing\ncomputational speed, and optimizing memory efficiency. Published codes focus on\ncontinuous rotations and unitary groups, which generally are not applicable to\nsystems with strong crystal-field effects. The PointGroupNRG code implements\nsymmetries related to discrete rotation groups, which are defined by the user\nin terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, together with particle conservation\nand spin rotation symmetries. In this paper we present a new version of the\ncode that extends the available finite groups, previously limited to simply\nreducible point groups, in a way that all point and double groups become\naccessible. It also includes the full spin-orbital rotation group. Moreover, to\nimprove the code's flexibility for impurities with complex interactions, this\nnew version allows to choose between a standard Anderson Hamiltonian for the\nimpurity or, as another novel feature, an ionic model that requires only the\nspectrum and the impurity Lehmann amplitudes.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12050v1) |\n| Quantum-like nonlinear interferometry with frequency-engineered\n  classical light | Romain Dalidet, Anthony Martin, Gr\u00e9gory Sauder, Laurent Labont\u00e9, S\u00e9bastien Tanzilli |   Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic\nentanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits. Nonlinear\noptics has served as a workhorse for the generation of entangled photon pairs,\nensuring both energy and phase conservation, but at the cost of limited rate\nand degraded signal-to-noise ratio compared to laser-based interferometry\napproaches. We present a \"quantum-like\" nonlinear optical method that reaches\nsuper-resolution in single-photon detection regime. This is achieved by\nreplacing photon-pairs by coherent states of light, mimicking quantum\nproperties through classical nonlinear optics processes. Our scheme utilizes\ntwo high-brightness lasers. This results in a substantially greater\nsignal-to-noise ratio compared to its quantum counterpart. Such an approach\npaves the way to significantly reduced acquisition times, providing a pathway\nto explore signals across a broader range of bandwidth. The need to increase\nthe frequency bandwidth of the quantum sensor significantly motivates the\npotential applications of this pathway.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12049v1) |\n| A Survey-Based Quantitative Analysis of Stress Factors and Their Impacts\n  Among Cybersecurity Professionals | Sunil Arora, John D. Hastings |   This study investigates the prevalence and underlying causes of work-related\nstress and burnout among cybersecurity professionals using a quantitative\nsurvey approach guided by the Job Demands-Resources model. Analysis of\nresponses from 50 cybersecurity practitioners reveals an alarming reality: 44%\nreport experiencing severe work-related stress and burnout, while an additional\n28% are uncertain about their condition. The demanding nature of cybersecurity\nroles, unrealistic expectations, and unsupportive organizational cultures\nemerge as primary factors fueling this crisis. Notably, 66% of respondents\nperceive cybersecurity jobs as more stressful than other IT positions, with 84%\nfacing additional challenges due to the pandemic and recent high-profile\nbreaches. The study finds that most cybersecurity experts are reluctant to\nreport their struggles to management, perpetuating a cycle of silence and\nneglect. To address this critical issue, the paper recommends that\norganizations foster supportive work environments, implement mindfulness\nprograms, and address systemic challenges. By prioritizing the mental health of\ncybersecurity professionals, organizations can cultivate a more resilient and\neffective workforce to protect against an ever-evolving threat landscape.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12047v1) |\n| Using Large Language Models to Generate Clinical Trial Tables and\n  Figures | Yumeng Yang, Peter Krusche, Kristyn Pantoja, Cheng Shi, Ethan Ludmir, Kirk Roberts, Gen Zhu |   Tables, figures, and listings (TFLs) are essential tools for summarizing\nclinical trial data. Creation of TFLs for reporting activities is often a\ntime-consuming task encountered routinely during the execution of clinical\ntrials. This study explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate\nthe generation of TFLs through prompt engineering and few-shot transfer\nlearning. Using public clinical trial data in ADaM format, our results\ndemonstrated that LLMs can efficiently generate TFLs with prompt instructions,\nshowcasing their potential in this domain.

While most approaches in the Safe\nReinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and\nrobot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them\nin complex real-world settings. Instead, model-based approaches that\nincorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning\nframework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on\nthe real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot\ndynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task-specific and hard\nto obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to\ncompute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long-term safety\nrequirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe\nexploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus\non ensuring long-term safety and handling of uncertainty. Our approach is\ncompetitive or superior to state-of-the-art methods in final performance while\nmaintaining safer behavior during training.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12045v1) |\n| Quasiperiodic Floquet-Gibbs states in Rydberg atomic systems | Wilson S. Martins, Federico Carollo, Kay Brandner, Igor Lesanovsky |   Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by\nfast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an\nequilibrium-like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet-Magnus\nHamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi's golden rule, we show\nthat such Floquet-Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated\nRydberg atomic systems, whose lab-frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function\nof time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the\nsystem, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which\nis necessary to uphold high-lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To\ncorroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five\ninteracting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate\nnumerically that the second-order Floquet-Gibbs state of this system is\nessentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding\nRedfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently\nlarge.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12044v1) |\n| Understanding the Effects of the Baidu-ULTR Logging Policy on Two-Tower\n  Models | Morris de Haan, Philipp Hager |   Despite the popularity of the two-tower model for unbiased learning to rank\n(ULTR) tasks, recent work suggests that it suffers from a major limitation that\ncould lead to its collapse in industry applications: the problem of logging\npolicy confounding. Several potential solutions have even been proposed;\nhowever, the evaluation of these methods was mostly conducted using\nsemi-synthetic simulation experiments. This paper bridges the gap between\ntheory and practice by investigating the confounding problem on the largest\nreal-world dataset, Baidu-ULTR. Our main contributions are threefold: 1) we\nshow that the conditions for the confounding problem are given on Baidu-ULTR,\n2) the confounding problem bears no significant effect on the two-tower model,\nand 3) we point to a potential mismatch between expert annotations, the golden\nstandard in ULTR, and user click behavior.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12043v1) |\n| ASR Benchmarking: Need for a More Representative Conversational Dataset | Gaurav Maheshwari, Dmitry Ivanov, Th\u00e9o Johannet, Kevin El Haddad |   Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable\nperformance on widely used benchmarks such as LibriSpeech and Fleurs.

Furthermore, we observe a correlation\nbetween Word Error Rate and the presence of speech disfluencies, highlighting\nthe critical need for more realistic, conversational ASR benchmarks.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12042v1) |\n\n", "role": "user", "name": "Executor"}, {"content": "Summarise", "role": "user", "name": "Admin"}, {"content": "### Summary of Recent Papers on LLM Applications from arXiv\n\nThe following table summarizes recent papers related to Large Language Model (LLM) applications, categorized by their respective domains.
