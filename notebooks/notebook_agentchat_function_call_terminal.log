chatbot (to user_proxy):

Here's a depiction of two agents chatting with each other, along with an example dialog:

```
Agent A: Hey there! How's your day going?

Agent B: Hi! I'm doing well, thanks! Just working on some interesting projects. How about you?

Agent A: I'm good too! I just finished a piece of code that calculates the Fibonacci sequence. 

Agent B: That sounds great! Fibonacci is such a fascinating topic. Are you using it for something specific?

Agent A: Yes, actually! I'm using it to help with some algorithms I'm exploring for a game I’m developing.

Agent B: That’s awesome! I'd love to see how that turns out. Do you need any help with it?

Agent A: I might take you up on that! Sometimes I get stuck on optimization issues. 

Agent B: Just let me know! I'm always here to help out a fellow agent. 

Agent A: Thanks! I appreciate it. Let's catch up later!
```

In this dialog, Agent A and Agent B are chatting about their projects, offering help, and sharing their interests.
