search_query = "gpt-4"
max_results = 1

# Construct the query
query = f"search_query=all:{search_query}&start=0&max_results={max_results}&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=descending"

# Make the request to the arXiv API
response = requests.get(arxiv_url + query)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Latest paper on GPT-4:")
    print(response.text)
else:
    print("Error fetching data from arXiv.")

    <title>Human-like Affective Cognition in Foundation Models</title>
    <summary>  Understanding emotions is fundamental to human interaction and experience.
Humans easily infer emotions from situations or facial expressions, situations
from emotions, and do a variety of other affective cognition. How adept is
modern AI at these inferences? We introduce an evaluation framework for testing
affective cognition in foundation models. Starting from psychological theory,
we generate 1,280 diverse scenarios exploring relationships between appraisals,
emotions, expressions, and outcomes. We evaluate the abilities of foundation
models (GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini-1.5-Pro) and humans (N = 567) across carefully
selected conditions. Our results show foundation models tend to agree with
human intuitions, matching or exceeding interparticipant agreement. In some
conditions, models are ``superhuman'' -- they better predict modal human
judgements than the average human. All models benefit from chain-of-thought
reasoning. This suggests foundation models have acquired a human-like
understanding of emotions and their influence on beliefs and behavior.

**Latest Paper on GPT-4:**

- **Title:** Human-like Affective Cognition in Foundation Models
- **Authors:** Kanishk Gandhi, Zoe Lynch, Jan-Philipp Fränken, Kayla Patterson, Sharon Wambu, Tobias Gerstenberg, Desmond C. Ong, Noah D. Goodman
- **Published Date:** September 18, 2024
- **Link to Paper:** [Read the paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11733v2)
- **PDF Link:** [Download PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11733v2)

**Abstract Summary:**
The paper discusses the evaluation of affective cognition in foundation models, including GPT-4. It introduces a framework for testing how well these models understand emotions and their implications in human interactions. The study involves generating diverse scenarios to assess the models' abilities to infer emotions and situations, comparing their performance to that of humans. The results indicate that foundation models can match or exceed human intuitions in some cases, suggesting they have developed a human-like understanding of emotions.

**Potential Applications in Software:**

1. **Emotion Recognition Systems:**
   - GPT-4 can be integrated into applications that require understanding user emotions, such as customer support chatbots or mental health apps, enhancing user interaction by responding appropriately to emotional cues.

2. **Enhanced User Interfaces:**
   - Software can leverage GPT-4's understanding of emotions to create more intuitive user interfaces that adapt based on user sentiment, improving user experience.

3. **Content Generation:**
   - Applications in content creation (e.g., marketing, storytelling) can utilize GPT-4 to generate emotionally resonant narratives or advertisements that align with target audience sentiments.

4. **Personalized Learning:**
   - In educational software, GPT-4 can tailor learning experiences based on the emotional state of students, providing support or challenges as needed to enhance engagement and learning outcomes.

5. **Game Development:**
   - In gaming, GPT-4 can be used to create more immersive experiences by generating dynamic narratives that respond to player emotions, making gameplay more engaging.

6. **Social Robotics:**
   - Robots equipped with GPT-4 can better interact with humans by understanding and responding to emotional cues, making them more effective in roles such as companionship or assistance.
