We find the dEs exhibit a&#10;diversity in ages with the younger dEs being less enhanced than the older,&#10;suggesting a complex star formation history for those dEs that recently entered&#10;Virgo while others have been quenched shortly after reionization.&#10;Orbit&#45;superposition modeling allowed us to recover viewing angles, stellar&#10;mass&#45;to&#45;light ratios (with gradients), as well as the intrinsic orbit&#10;structure. We find that the angular momentum of the dEs is strongly suppressed&#10;compared to ordinary early&#45;type galaxies and correlates with the environment.&#10;Flattened dEs are so because of a suppressed kinetic energy perpendicular to&#10;their equatorial plane. Combining population and dynamical modeling results, we&#10;find an age&#45;dependent stellar initial mass function (IMF) or, alternatively,&#10;evidence for a more extended star formation history for those galaxies that&#10;have had higher initial mass and/or inhabited lower density environments. dEs&#10;appear to have a spatially homogeneous stellar structure but the state they&#10;were `frozen&#39; in as they stopped forming stars varies dramatically according to&#10;their initial conditions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10518v1) |&#10;| RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long&#45;Context LLM Inference via Vector&#10; &#160;Retrieval | Di Liu, Meng Chen, Baotong Lu, Huiqiang Jiang, Zhenhua Han, Qianxi Zhang, Qi Chen, Chengruidong Zhang, Bailu Ding, Kai Zhang, Chen Chen, Fan Yang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu | &#160;&#160;Transformer&#45;based large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly important&#10;in various domains. However, the quadratic time complexity of attention&#10;operation poses a significant challenge for scaling to longer contexts due to&#10;the extremely high inference latency and GPU memory consumption for caching&#10;key&#45;value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training&#45;free&#10;approach to accelerate attention computation. To leverage the dynamic sparse&#10;property of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor&#10;search (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most&#10;relevant ones via vector search during generation. Due to the&#10;out&#45;of&#45;distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors, off&#45;the&#45;shelf&#10;ANNS indexes still need to scan O(N) (usually 30% of all keys) data for&#10;accurate retrieval, which fails to exploit the high sparsity.&#10;RetrievalAttention first identifies the OOD challenge of ANNS&#45;based attention,&#10;and addresses it via an attention&#45;aware vector search algorithm that can adapt&#10;to queries and only access 1&#45;&#45;3% of data, thus achieving a sub&#45;linear time&#10;complexity. RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of&#10;long&#45;context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the&#10;model accuracy. Especially, RetrievalAttention only needs 16GB GPU memory for&#10;serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating&#10;one token in 0.188 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB).&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516v1) |&#10;| An Efficient Self&#45;Learning Framework For Interactive Spoken Dialog&#10; &#160;Systems | Hitesh Tulsiani, David M. Chan, Shalini Ghosh, Garima Lalwani, Prabhat Pandey, Ankish Bansal, Sri Garimella, Ariya Rastrow, Björn Hoffmeister | &#160;&#160;Dialog systems, such as voice assistants, are expected to engage with users&#10;in complex, evolving conversations. Unfortunately, traditional automatic speech&#10;recognition (ASR) systems deployed in such applications are usually trained to&#10;recognize each turn independently and lack the ability to adapt to the&#10;conversational context or incorporate user feedback. In this work, we introduce&#10;a general framework for ASR in dialog systems that can go beyond learning from&#10;single&#45;turn utterances and learn over time how to adapt to both explicit&#10;supervision and implicit user feedback present in multi&#45;turn conversations. We&#10;accomplish that by leveraging advances in student&#45;teacher learning and&#10;context&#45;aware dialog processing, and designing contrastive self&#45;supervision&#10;approaches with Ohm, a new online hard&#45;negative mining approach. We show that&#10;leveraging our new framework compared to traditional training leads to relative&#10;WER reductions of close to 10% in real&#45;world dialog systems, and up to 26% on&#10;public synthetic data.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10515v1) |&#10;| Constraints on axions from patchy screening of the cosmic microwave&#10; &#160;background | Samuel Goldstein, Fiona McCarthy, Cristina Mondino, J. Colin Hill, Junwu Huang, Matthew C. Johnson | &#160;&#160;The resonant conversion of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons into&#10;axions within large&#45;scale structure induces an anisotropic spectral distortion&#10;in CMB temperature maps. Applying state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art foreground cleaning&#10;techniques to $textit{Planck}$ CMB observations, we construct maps of&#10;axion&#45;induced &quot;patchy screening&quot; of the CMB. We cross&#45;correlate these maps with&#10;data from the $textit{unWISE}$ galaxy survey and find no evidence of axions.&#10;We constrain the axion&#45;photon coupling, $g_{agammagamma} &#10;esssim 2 times&#10;10^{&#45;12}~{&#13;m GeV}^{&#45;1}$, at the 95% confidence level for axion masses in the&#10;range $10^{&#45;13}~{&#13;m eV} &#10;esssim m_a &#10;esssim 10^{&#45;12}~{&#13;m eV}$. These&#10;constraints are competitive with the tightest astrophysical axion limits in&#10;this mass range and are inferred from robust population&#45;level statistics, which&#10;makes them complementary to existing searches that rely on modeling of&#10;individual systems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10514v1) |&#10;| Weak Superimposed Codes of Improved Asymptotic Rate and Their Randomized&#10; &#160;Construction | Yu Tsunoda, Yuichiro Fujiwara | &#160;&#160;Weak superimposed codes are combinatorial structures related closely to&#10;generalized cover&#45;free families, superimposed codes, and disjunct matrices in&#10;that they are only required to satisfy similar but less stringent conditions.&#10;This class of codes may also be seen as a stricter variant of what are known as&#10;locally thin families in combinatorics. Originally, weak superimposed codes&#10;were introduced in the context of multimedia content protection against illegal&#10;distribution of copies under the assumption that a coalition of malicious users&#10;may employ the averaging attack with adversarial noise. As in many other kinds&#10;of codes in information theory, it is of interest and importance in the study&#10;of weak superimposed codes to find the highest achievable rate in the&#10;asymptotic regime and give an efficient construction that produces an infinite&#10;sequence of codes that achieve it. Here, we prove a tighter lower bound than&#10;the sharpest known one on the rate of optimal weak superimposed codes and give&#10;a polynomial&#45;time randomized construction algorithm for codes that&#10;asymptotically attain our improved bound with high probability. Our&#10;probabilistic approach is versatile and applicable to many other related codes&#10;and arrays.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10511v1) |&#10;| Pennsieve &#45; A Collaborative Platform for Translational Neuroscience and&#10; &#160;Beyond | Zack Goldblum, Zhongchuan Xu, Haoer Shi, Patryk Orzechowski, Jamaal Spence, Kathryn A Davis, Brian Litt, Nishant Sinha, Joost Wagenaar | &#160;&#160;The exponential growth of neuroscientific data necessitates platforms that&#10;facilitate data management and multidisciplinary collaboration.

Pennsieve supports complex multimodal&#10;datasets and provides tools for data visualization and analyses. It takes a&#10;comprehensive approach to data integration, enabling researchers to define&#10;custom metadata schemas and utilize advanced tools to filter and query their&#10;data. Pennsieve&#39;s modular architecture allows external applications to extend&#10;its capabilities, and collaborative workspaces with peer&#45;reviewed data&#10;publishing mechanisms promote high&#45;quality datasets optimized for downstream&#10;analysis, both in the cloud and on&#45;premises.&#10; &#160;Pennsieve forms the core for major neuroscience research programs including&#10;the NIH SPARC Initiative, NIH HEAL Initiative&#39;s PRECISION Human Pain Network,&#10;and NIH HEAL RE&#45;JOIN Initiative. It serves more than 80 research groups&#10;worldwide, along with several large&#45;scale, inter&#45;institutional projects at&#10;clinical sites through the University of Pennsylvania.

Specifically, we investigate the role of resistivity&#10;in the dynamical evolution of neutron stars over a period of up to 100 ms and&#10;its effects on their quasi&#45;equilibrium configurations. Our results demonstrate&#10;that resistivity can significantly influence the development of&#10;magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, resulting in markedly different magnetic&#10;field geometries. Additionally, resistivity suppresses the growth of these&#10;instabilities, leading to a reduction in the amplitude of emitted gravitational&#10;waves. Despite the variations in magnetic field geometries, the ratio of&#10;poloidal to toroidal field energies remains consistently 9:1 throughout the&#10;simulations, for the models we investigated.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10508v1) |&#10;| Beth&#45;Uhlenbeck equation for the thermodynamics of fluctuations in a&#10; &#160;generalised 2+1D Gross&#45;Neveu model | Biplab Mahato, David Blaschke, Dietmar Ebert | &#160;&#160;We study a generalised version of Gross&#45;Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions. The&#10;model is inspired from graphene which shows a linear dispersion relation near&#10;the Dirac points. The phase structure and the thermodynamic properties in the&#10;mean field approximation have been studied before. Here we go beyond the mean&#10;field level by deriving a Beth&#45;Uhlenbeck equation for Gaussian fluctuations,&#10;solutions of which we explore numerically, for the first time including their&#10;momentum dependence. We discuss the excitonic mass, fluctuation pressure and&#10;phase shifts. We also perform a comparison with the NJL model in 3+1 dimension&#10;and discuss its implication for graphene.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10507v1) |&#10;| Context&#45;aware Code Segmentation for C&#45;to&#45;Rust Translation using Large&#10; &#160;Language Models | Momoko Shiraishi, Takahiro Shinagawa | &#160;&#160;There is strong motivation to translate C code into Rust code due to the&#10;continuing threat of memory safety vulnerabilities in existing C programs and&#10;the significant attention paid to Rust as an alternative to the C language.&#10;While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating this translation&#10;by generating more natural and safer code than rule&#45;based methods, previous&#10;studies have shown that LLM&#45;generated Rust code often fails to compile, even&#10;for relatively small C programs, due to significant differences between the two&#10;languages and context window limitations. We propose an LLM&#45;based translation&#10;scheme that improves the success rate of translating large&#45;scale C code into&#10;compilable Rust code. Our approach involves three key techniques: (1)&#10;pre&#45;processing the C code to better align its structure and expressions with&#10;Rust, (2) segmenting the code into optimally sized translation units to avoid&#10;exceeding the LLM&#39;s context window limits, and (3) iteratively compiling and&#10;repairing errors while maintaining consistency between translation units using&#10;context&#45;supplementing prompts. Compilation success is an essential first step&#10;in achieving functional equivalence, as only compilable code can be further&#10;tested. In experiments with 20 benchmark C programs, including those exceeding&#10;4 kilo lines of code, we successfully translated all programs into compilable&#10;Rust code without losing corresponding parts of the original code.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10506v1) |&#10;| Machine Learning Optimization of non&#45;Kasha Behavior and of Transient&#10; &#160;Dynamics in Model Retinal Isomerization | Davinder Singh, Chern Chuang, Paul Brumer | &#160;&#160;Designing a model of retinal isomerization in Rhodopsin, the first step in&#10;vision, that accounts for both experimental transient and stationary state&#10;observables is challenging. Here, multi&#45;objective Bayesian optimization is&#10;employed to refine the parameters of a minimal two&#45;state&#45;two&#45;mode (TM) model&#10;describing the photoisomerization of retinal in Rhodopsin. With an appropriate&#10;selection of objectives, the optimized retinal model predicts excitation&#10;wavelength&#45;dependent fluorescence spectra that closely align with&#10;experimentally observed non&#45;Kasha behavior in the non&#45;equilibrium steady state.&#10;Further, adjustments to the potential energy surface within the TM model reduce&#10;the discrepancies across the time domain. Overall, agreement with experimental&#10;data is excellent.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10505v1) |&#10;| DILA: Dictionary Label Attention for Mechanistic Interpretability in&#10; &#160;High&#45;dimensional Multi&#45;label Medical Coding Prediction | John Wu, David Wu, Jimeng Sun | &#160;&#160;Predicting high&#45;dimensional or extreme multilabels, such as in medical&#10;coding, requires both accuracy and interpretability. Existing works often rely&#10;on local interpretability methods, failing to provide comprehensive&#10;explanations of the overall mechanism behind each label prediction within a&#10;multilabel set. We propose a mechanistic interpretability module called&#10;DIctionary Label Attention (method) that disentangles uninterpretable dense&#10;embeddings into a sparse embedding space, where each nonzero element (a&#10;dictionary feature) represents a globally learned medical concept. Through&#10;human evaluations, we show that our sparse embeddings are more human&#10;understandable than its dense counterparts by at least 50 percent. Our&#10;automated dictionary feature identification pipeline, leveraging large language&#10;models (LLMs), uncovers thousands of learned medical concepts by examining and&#10;summarizing the highest activating tokens for each dictionary feature. We&#10;represent the relationships between dictionary features and medical codes&#10;through a sparse interpretable matrix, enhancing the mechanistic and global&#10;understanding of the model&#39;s predictions while maintaining competitive&#10;performance and scalability without extensive human annotation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10504v1) |&#10;| Causal Language Modeling Can Elicit Search and Reasoning Capabilities on&#10; &#160;Logic Puzzles | Kulin Shah, Nishanth Dikkala, Xin Wang, Rina Panigrahy | &#160;&#160;Causal language modeling using the Transformer architecture has yielded&#10;remarkable capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) over the last few&#10;years. However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning&#10;capabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this&#10;work, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as&#10;solving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to&#10;search over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then&#10;apply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the&#10;application of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in&#10;a cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases,&#10;multiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We&#10;observe that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn&#10;to solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21%$ of the puzzles fully correctly)&#10;when trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that&#10;training Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and&#10;without such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis&#10;to Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves&#10;$92.04 %$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal&#10;representations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear&#10;probing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any&#10;given cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine&#10;implicit in the Transformer weights.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10502v1) |&#10;| Alignment with nonlinear velocity couplings: collision&#45;avoidance and&#10; &#160;micro&#45;to&#45;macro mean&#45;field limits | Young&#45;Pil Choi, Michał Fabisiak, Jan Peszek | &#160;&#160;We investigate the pressureless fractional Euler&#45;alignment system with&#10;nonlinear velocity couplings, referred to as the $p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system.&#10;This model features a nonlinear velocity alignment force, interpreted as a&#10;density&#45;weighted fractional $p$&#45;Laplacian when the singularity parameter&#10;$alpha$ exceeds the spatial dimension $d$. Our primary goal is to establish&#10;the existence of solutions for strongly singular interactions ($alpha ge d$)&#10;and compactly supported initial conditions. We construct solutions as&#10;mean&#45;field limits of empirical measures from a kinetic variant of the&#10;$p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system. Specifically, we show that a sequence of empirical&#10;measures converges to a finite Radon measure, whose local density and velocity&#10;satisfy the $p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system. Our results are the first to prove the&#10;existence of solutions to this system in multi&#45;dimensional settings without&#10;significant initial data restrictions, covering both nonlinear ($p&gt;2$) and&#10;linear ($p=2$) cases. Additionally, we establish global existence, uniqueness,&#10;and collision avoidance for the corresponding particle ODE system under&#10;non&#45;collisional initial conditions, extending previous results for $1 &#10;e p &#10;e&#10;alpha + 2$. This analysis supports our mean&#45;field limit argument and&#10;contributes to understanding alignment models with singular communication.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10501v1) |&#10;| Focus diverse phase retrieval test results on broadband continuous&#10; &#160;wavefront sensing in space telescope applications | Hyukmo Kang, Kyle Van Gorkom, Meghdoot Biswas, Daewook Kim, Ewan S. Douglas | &#160;&#160;Continuous wavefront sensing benefits space observatories in on&#45;orbit optical&#10;performance maintenance. To measure the phase of a wavefront, phase retrieval&#10;is an attractive technique as it uses multiple point spread function (PSF)&#10;images that are acquired by the telescope itself without extra metrology&#10;systems nor complicated calibration. The focus diverse phase retrieval utilizes&#10;PSFs from predetermined defocused positions to enhance the dynamic range of the&#10;algorithm. We describe an updated visible light active optics testbed with the&#10;addition of a linear motorized focus stage. The performance of the phase&#10;retrieval algorithm in broadband is tested under various cases. While broadband&#10;pass filters have advantages in higher signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio (SNR), the&#10;performance of phase retrieval can be restricted due to blurred image caused by&#10;diffraction and increased computing cost. We used multiple bandpass filters (10&#10;nm, 88 nm, and 150 nm) and investigated effects of bandwidth on the accuracy&#10;and required image acquisition conditions such as SNR, reaching accuracies&#10;below 20 nm RMS wavefront error at the widest bandwidth. We also investigated&#10;the dynamic range of the phase retrieval algorithm depending on the bandwidth&#10;and required amount of defocus to expand dynamic range. Finally, we simulated&#10;the continuous wavefront sensing and correction loop with a range of&#10;statistically generated representative telescope disturbance time series to&#10;test for edge cases.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10500v1) |&#10;| The role of higher&#45;order terms in trapped&#45;ion quantum computing with&#10; &#160;magnetic gradient induced coupling | Sebastian Nagies, Kevin T. Geier, Javed Akram, Junichi Okamoto, Dimitris Badounas, Christof Wunderlich, Michael Johanning, Philipp Hauke | &#160;&#160;Trapped&#45;ion hardware based on the Magnetic Gradient Induced Coupling (MAGIC)&#10;scheme is emerging as a promising platform for quantum computing. Nevertheless,&#10;in this (as in any other) quantum&#45;computing platform, many technical questions&#10;still have to be resolved before large&#45;scale and error&#45;tolerant applications&#10;are possible. In this work, we present a thorough discussion of the&#10;contribution of higher&#45;order terms to the MAGIC setup, which can occur due to&#10;anharmonicities in the external potential of the ion crystal (e.g., through&#10;Coulomb repulsion) or through curvature of the applied magnetic field. These&#10;terms take the form of three&#45;spin couplings as well as diverse terms that&#10;couple spins to phonons. We find that most of these are negligible in realistic&#10;situations, with only two contributions that need careful attention. First,&#10;there are parasitic longitudinal fields whose strength increases with chain&#10;length, but which can easily be compensated by a microwave detuning. Second,&#10;anharmonicities of the Coulomb interaction can lead to well&#45;known two&#45;to&#45;one&#10;conversions of phonon excitations, which can be avoided if the phonons are&#10;ground&#45;state cooled. Our detailed analysis constitutes an important&#10;contribution on the way of making magnetic&#45;gradient trapped&#45;ion quantum&#10;technology fit for large&#45;scale applications, and it may inspire new ways to&#10;purposefully design interaction terms.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10498v1) |&#10;| MusicLIME: Explainable Multimodal Music Understanding | Theodoros Sotirou, Vassilis Lyberatos, Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Stamou | &#160;&#160;Multimodal models are critical for music understanding tasks, as they capture&#10;the complex interplay between audio and lyrics.

In this paper, we introduce MusicLIME, a model&#45;agnostic&#10;feature importance explanation method designed for multimodal music models.&#10;Unlike traditional unimodal methods, which analyze each modality separately&#10;without considering the interaction between them, often leading to incomplete&#10;or misleading explanations, MusicLIME reveals how audio and lyrical features&#10;interact and contribute to predictions, providing a holistic view of the&#10;model&#39;s decision&#45;making. Additionally, we enhance local explanations by&#10;aggregating them into global explanations, giving users a broader perspective&#10;of model behavior.

Most current recommender systems provide&#10;recommendations using conventional methods such as collaborative or&#10;content&#45;based filtering. Diffusion is a new approach to generative AI that&#10;improves on previous generative AI approaches such as Variational Autoencoders&#10;(VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We incorporate diffusion in&#10;a recommender system that mirrors the sequence users take when browsing and&#10;rating items. Although a few current recommender systems incorporate diffusion,&#10;they do not incorporate classifier&#45;free guidance, a new innovation in diffusion&#10;models as a whole. In this paper, we present a diffusion recommender system&#10;that augments the underlying recommender system model for improved performance&#10;and also incorporates classifier&#45;free guidance. Our findings show improvements&#10;over state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art recommender systems for most metrics for several&#10;recommendation tasks on a variety of datasets.

We&#10;find that for the same parameter count, the STU and its variants outperform the&#10;Transformer as well as other leading state space models across various&#10;modalities.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10489v1) |&#10;| Do Pre&#45;trained Vision&#45;Language Models Encode Object States? | Kaleb Newman, Shijie Wang, Yuan Zang, David Heffren, Chen Sun | &#160;&#160;For a vision&#45;language model (VLM) to understand the physical world, such as&#10;cause and effect, a first step is to capture the temporal dynamics of the&#10;visual world, for example how the physical states of objects evolve over time&#10;(e.g. a whole apple into a sliced apple). Our paper aims to investigate if VLMs&#10;pre&#45;trained on web&#45;scale data learn to encode object states, which can be&#10;extracted with zero&#45;shot text prompts. We curate an object state recognition&#10;dataset ChangeIt&#45;Frames, and evaluate nine open&#45;source VLMs, including models&#10;trained with contrastive and generative objectives. We observe that while these&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art vision&#45;language models can reliably perform object&#10;recognition, they consistently fail to accurately distinguish the objects&#39;&#10;physical states. Through extensive experiments, we identify three areas for&#10;improvements for VLMs to better encode object states, namely the quality of&#10;object localization, the architecture to bind concepts to objects, and the&#10;objective to learn discriminative visual and language encoders on object&#10;states. Data and code are released.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10488v1) |&#10;| A Host Galaxy Morphology Link Between Quasi&#45;Periodic Eruptions and Tidal&#10; &#160;Disruption Events | Olivier Gilbert, John J. Ruan, Michael Eracleous, Daryl Haggard, Jessie C. Runnoe | &#160;&#160;The physical processes that produce X&#45;ray Quasi&#45;Periodic Eruptions (QPEs)&#10;recently discovered from the nuclei of several low&#45;redshift galaxies are&#10;mysterious. Several pieces of observational evidence strongly suggest a link&#10;between QPEs and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE). Previous studies also reveal&#10;that the morphologies of TDE host galaxies are highly concentrated, with high&#10;Sersic indicies, bulge&#45;to&#45;total light (B/T) ratios, and stellar surface mass&#10;densities relative to the broader galaxy population. We use these distinctive&#10;properties to test the link between QPEs and TDEs, by comparing these&#10;parameters of QPE host galaxies to TDE host galaxies. We employ archival Legacy&#10;Survey images of a sample of 9 QPE host galaxies and a sample of 13 TDE host&#10;galaxies, and model their surface brightness profiles. We show that QPE host&#10;galaxies have high Sersic indices of ~3, high B/T ratios of ~0.5, and high&#10;surface mass densities of ~10^10 Msun kpc^&#45;2. These properties are similar to&#10;TDE host galaxies, but are in strong contrast to a mass&#45; and redshift&#45;matched&#10;control sample of galaxies. We also find tentative evidence that the central&#10;black holes in both QPE and TDE host galaxies are undermassive relative to&#10;their stellar mass. The morphological similarities between QPE and TDE host&#10;galaxies at the population level add to the mounting evidence of a physical&#10;link between these phenomena, and favor QPE models that also invoke TDEs.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10486v1) |&#10;| Tuning the Rate of Tightly Packed Systems To Produce Planet Occurrence&#10; &#160;Trends with Galactic Height | Sarah Ballard | &#160;&#160;The formation of planetary systems has historically been considered in&#10;isolation, decoupled from processes on galactic scales. Recent findings&#10;employing data from ESA&#39;s Gaia mission challenge this narrative, identifying&#10;trends in planet occurrence with galactic kinematics and stellar age. The&#10;findings indicate changes in planet occurrence over and above the predicted&#10;changes from metallicity variation within the Milky Way, so that changes to&#10;stellar metallicity alone (long understood to be deterministic in planet&#10;outcomes) cannot explain the trends entirely. The scope of potential factors&#10;influencing planet formation has grown progressively wider, with accompanying&#10;theoretical support for galactic&#45;scale influences upon planet formation. In&#10;this manuscript, we investigate specifically how changes to the rate of Systems&#10;of Tightly&#45;packed Inner Planets (STIPs) could manifest as a trend in planet&#10;occurrence with galactic height. We focus our study upon M dwarf planetary&#10;systems for two reasons: first, they host STIPs at high rates, and secondly,&#10;their longevity makes them useful probes for kinematic trends over Gyr. We&#10;consider two models for a varying STIP rate: one in which STIP likelihood is&#10;determined by stellar age alone, irrespective of galactic time, and another in&#10;which the STIP likelihood suddenly increased in recent galactic history. Both&#10;models, which impose a higher STIP likelihood among younger stars, produce a&#10;negative gradient in planet occurrence with increasing height from the galactic&#10;midplane. We find that a step function model in which STIP likelihood increased&#10;by a factor of several ~a few Gyr ago resembles an observed trend among FGK&#10;dwarfs. We consider plausible physical mechanisms that could mimic the&#10;hypothesized model, given known links between STIP occurrence and other stellar&#10;and planetary properties.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10485v1) |&#10;| XLM for Autonomous Driving Systems: A Comprehensive Review | Sonda Fourati, Wael Jaafar, Noura Baccar, Safwan Alfattani | &#160;&#160;Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable proficiency in various&#10;information&#45;processing tasks. These tasks span from extracting data and&#10;summarizing literature to generating content, predictive modeling,&#10;decision&#45;making, and system controls. Moreover, Vision Large Models (VLMs) and&#10;Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which represent the next generation of language&#10;models, a.k.a., XLMs, can combine and integrate many data modalities with the&#10;strength of language understanding, thus advancing several information&#45;based&#10;systems, such as Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). Indeed, by combining&#10;language communication with multimodal sensory inputs, e.g., panoramic images&#10;and LiDAR or radar data, accurate driving actions can be taken. In this&#10;context, we provide in this survey paper a comprehensive overview of the&#10;potential of XLMs towards achieving autonomous driving. Specifically, we review&#10;the relevant literature on ADS and XLMs, including their architectures, tools,&#10;and frameworks. Then, we detail the proposed approaches to deploy XLMs for&#10;autonomous driving solutions. Finally, we provide the related challenges to XLM&#10;deployment for ADS and point to future research directions aiming to enable XLM&#10;adoption in future ADS frameworks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10484v1) |&#10;| Efficient polarizable QM/MM using the direct reaction field Hamiltonian&#10; &#160;with electrostatic potential fitted multipole operators | Thomas P. Fay, Nicolas Ferré, Miquel Huix&#45;Rotllant | &#160;&#160;Electronic polarization and dispersion are decisive actors in determining&#10;interaction energies between molecules. These interactions have a particularly&#10;profound effect on excitation energies of molecules in complex environments,&#10;especially when the excitation involves a significant degree of charge&#10;reorganisation. The direct reaction field (DRF) approach, which has seen a&#10;recent revival of interest, provides a powerful framework for describing these&#10;interactions in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models of&#10;systems, where a small subsystem of interest is described using quantum&#10;chemical methods and the remainder is treated with a simple MM force field. In&#10;this paper we show how the DRF approach can be combined with the electrostatic&#10;potential fitted (ESPF) multipole operator description of the QM region charge&#10;density, which reduces the scaling $mathcal{O}(N_mathrm{MM}^3)$ of the method&#10;with MM system to $mathcal{O}(N_mathrm{MM}^2)$. We also show how the DRF&#10;approach can be combined with fluctuating charge descriptions of the&#10;polarizable environment, as well as previously used atom&#45;centred&#10;dipole&#45;polarizability based models. We further show that the ESPF&#45;DRF method&#10;provides an accurate description of molecular interactions in both ground and&#10;excited electronic states of the QM system and apply it to predict the gas to&#10;aqueous solution solvatochromic shifts in the UV/visible absorption spectrum of&#10;acrolein.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10483v1) |&#10;| Schrodinger&#39;s Memory: Large Language Models | Wei Wang, Qing Li | &#160;&#160;Memory is the foundation of LLMs&#39; functionality, yet past research has lacked&#10;an in&#45;depth exploration of their memory capabilities and underlying theory. In&#10;this paper, we apply UAT theory to explain the memory mechanism of LLMs and&#10;propose a new approach for evaluating LLM performance by comparing the memory&#10;capacities of different models. Through extensive experiments, we validate our&#10;theory and the memory abilities of LLMs. Finally, we compare the capabilities&#10;of the human brain and LLMs, highlighting both their similarities and&#10;differences in terms of working mechanisms.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10482v1) |&#10;| Exploring 3D Face Reconstruction and Fusion Methods for Face&#10; &#160;Verification: A Case&#45;Study in Video Surveillance | Simone Maurizio La Cava, Sara Concas, Ruben Tolosana, Roberto Casula, Giulia Orrù, Martin Drahansky, Julian Fierrez, Gian Luca Marcialis | &#160;&#160;3D face reconstruction (3DFR) algorithms are based on specific assumptions&#10;tailored to distinct application scenarios. These assumptions limit their use&#10;when acquisition conditions, such as the subject&#39;s distance from the camera or&#10;the camera&#39;s characteristics, are different than expected, as typically happens&#10;in video surveillance. Additionally, 3DFR algorithms follow various strategies&#10;to address the reconstruction of a 3D shape from 2D data, such as statistical&#10;model fitting, photometric stereo, or deep learning. In the present study, we&#10;explore the application of three 3DFR algorithms representative of the SOTA,&#10;employing each one as the template set generator for a face verification&#10;system. The scores provided by each system are combined by score&#45;level fusion.&#10;We show that the complementarity induced by different 3DFR algorithms improves&#10;performance when tests are conducted at never&#45;seen&#45;before distances from the&#10;camera and camera characteristics (cross&#45;distance and cross&#45;camera settings),&#10;thus encouraging further investigations on multiple 3DFR&#45;based approaches.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10481v1) |&#10;| Addressing misspecification in contextual optimization | Omar Bennouna, Jiawei Zhang, Saurabh Amin, Asuman Ozdaglar | &#160;&#160;We study a linear contextual optimization problem where a decision maker has&#10;access to historical data and contextual features to learn a cost prediction&#10;model aimed at minimizing decision error. We adopt the predict&#45;then&#45;optimize&#10;framework for this analysis. Given that perfect model alignment with reality is&#10;often unrealistic in practice, we focus on scenarios where the chosen&#10;hypothesis set is misspecified. In this context, it remains unclear whether&#10;current contextual optimization approaches can effectively address such model&#10;misspecification. In this paper, we present a novel integrated learning and&#10;optimization approach designed to tackle model misspecification in contextual&#10;optimization. This approach offers theoretical generalizability, tractability,&#10;and optimality guarantees, along with strong practical performance. Our method&#10;involves minimizing a tractable surrogate loss that aligns with the performance&#10;value from cost vector predictions, regardless of whether the model&#10;misspecified or not, and can be optimized in reasonable time. To our knowledge,&#10;no previous work has provided an approach with such guarantees in the context&#10;of model misspecification.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10479v1) |&#10;| Local SGD for Near&#45;Quadratic Problems: Improving Convergence under&#10; &#160;Unconstrained Noise Conditions | Andrey Sadchikov, Savelii Chezhegov, Aleksandr Beznosikov, Alexander Gasnikov | &#160;&#160;Distributed optimization plays an important role in modern large&#45;scale&#10;machine learning and data processing systems by optimizing the utilization of&#10;computational resources. One of the classical and popular approaches is Local&#10;Stochastic Gradient Descent (Local SGD), characterized by multiple local&#10;updates before averaging, which is particularly useful in distributed&#10;environments to reduce communication bottlenecks and improve scalability. A&#10;typical feature of this method is the dependence on the frequency of&#10;communications. But in the case of a quadratic target function with homogeneous&#10;data distribution over all devices, the influence of frequency of&#10;communications vanishes. As a natural consequence, subsequent studies include&#10;the assumption of a Lipschitz Hessian, as this indicates the similarity of the&#10;optimized function to a quadratic one to some extent. However, in order to&#10;extend the completeness of the Local SGD theory and unlock its potential, in&#10;this paper we abandon the Lipschitz Hessian assumption by introducing a new&#10;concept of $textit{approximate quadraticity}$. This assumption gives a new&#10;perspective on problems that have near quadratic properties. In addition,&#10;existing theoretical analyses of Local SGD often assume bounded variance. We,&#10;in turn, consider the unbounded noise condition, which allows us to broaden the&#10;class of studied problems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10478v1) |&#10;| SimInversion: A Simple Framework for Inversion&#45;Based Text&#45;to&#45;Image&#10; &#160;Editing | Qi Qian, Haiyang Xu, Ming Yan, Juhua Hu | &#160;&#160;Diffusion models demonstrate impressive image generation performance with&#10;text guidance. Inspired by the learning process of diffusion, existing images&#10;can be edited according to text by DDIM inversion. However, the vanilla DDIM&#10;inversion is not optimized for classifier&#45;free guidance and the accumulated&#10;error will result in the undesired performance. While many algorithms are&#10;developed to improve the framework of DDIM inversion for editing, in this work,&#10;we investigate the approximation error in DDIM inversion and propose to&#10;disentangle the guidance scale for the source and target branches to reduce the&#10;error while keeping the original framework. Moreover, a better guidance scale&#10;(i.e., 0.5) than default settings can be derived theoretically. Experiments on&#10;PIE&#45;Bench show that our proposal can improve the performance of DDIM inversion&#10;dramatically without sacrificing efficiency.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10476v1) |&#10;| Leadership and Engagement Dynamics in Legislative Twitter Networks:&#10; &#160;Statistical Analysis and Modeling | Carolina Luque, Juan Sosa | &#160;&#160;In this manuscript, we analyze the interaction network on Twitter among&#10;members of the 117th U.S. Congress to assess the visibility of political&#10;leaders and explore how systemic properties and node attributes influence the&#10;formation of legislative connections. We employ descriptive social network&#10;statistical methods, the exponential random graph model (ERGM), and the&#10;stochastic block model (SBM) to evaluate the relative impact of network&#10;systemic properties, as well as institutional and personal traits, on the&#10;generation of online relationships among legislators. Our findings reveal that&#10;legislative networks on social media platforms like Twitter tend to reinforce&#10;the leadership of dominant political actors rather than diminishing their&#10;influence. However, we identify that these leadership roles can manifest in&#10;various forms. Additionally, we highlight that online connections within&#10;legislative networks are influenced by both the systemic properties of the&#10;network and institutional characteristics.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10475v1) |&#10;| MacDiff: Unified Skeleton Modeling with Masked Conditional Diffusion | Lehong Wu, Lilang Lin, Jiahang Zhang, Yiyang Ma, Jiaying Liu | &#160;&#160;Self&#45;supervised learning has proved effective for skeleton&#45;based human action&#10;understanding. However, previous works either rely on contrastive learning that&#10;suffers false negative problems or are based on reconstruction that learns too&#10;much unessential low&#45;level clues, leading to limited representations for&#10;downstream tasks. Recently, great advances have been made in generative&#10;learning, which is naturally a challenging yet meaningful pretext task to model&#10;the general underlying data distributions. However, the representation learning&#10;capacity of generative models is under&#45;explored, especially for the skeletons&#10;with spacial sparsity and temporal redundancy. To this end, we propose Masked&#10;Conditional Diffusion (MacDiff) as a unified framework for human skeleton&#10;modeling. For the first time, we leverage diffusion models as effective&#10;skeleton representation learners. Specifically, we train a diffusion decoder&#10;conditioned on the representations extracted by a semantic encoder. Random&#10;masking is applied to encoder inputs to introduce a information bottleneck and&#10;remove redundancy of skeletons. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that&#10;our generative objective involves the contrastive learning objective which&#10;aligns the masked and noisy views. Meanwhile, it also enforces the&#10;representation to complement for the noisy view, leading to better&#10;generalization performance. MacDiff achieves state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art performance on&#10;representation learning benchmarks while maintaining the competence for&#10;generative tasks. Moreover, we leverage the diffusion model for data&#10;augmentation, significantly enhancing the fine&#45;tuning performance in scenarios&#10;with scarce labeled data.

Hassan | &#160;&#160;The proliferation of open Pre&#45;trained Language Models (PTLMs) on model&#10;registry platforms like Hugging Face (HF) presents both opportunities and&#10;challenges for companies building products around them. Similar to traditional&#10;software dependencies, PTLMs continue to evolve after a release. However, the&#10;current state of release practices of PTLMs on model registry platforms are&#10;plagued by a variety of inconsistencies, such as ambiguous naming conventions&#10;and inaccessible model training documentation. Given the knowledge gap on&#10;current PTLM release practices, our empirical study uses a mixed&#45;methods&#10;approach to analyze the releases of 52,227 PTLMs on the most well&#45;known model&#10;registry, HF. Our results reveal 148 different naming practices for PTLM&#10;releases, with 40.87% of changes to model weight files not represented in the&#10;adopted name&#45;based versioning practice or their documentation. In addition, we&#10;identified that the 52,227 PTLMs are derived from only 299 different base&#10;models (the modified original models used to create 52,227 PTLMs), with&#10;Fine&#45;tuning and Quantization being the most prevalent modification methods&#10;applied to these base models. Significant gaps in release transparency, in&#10;terms of training dataset specifications and model card availability, still&#10;exist, highlighting the need for standardized documentation. While we&#10;identified a model naming practice explicitly differentiating between major and&#10;minor PTLM releases, we did not find any significant difference in the types of&#10;changes that went into either type of releases, suggesting that major/minor&#10;version numbers for PTLMs often are chosen arbitrarily. Our findings provide&#10;valuable insights to improve PTLM release practices, nudging the field towards&#10;more formal semantic versioning practices.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10472v1) |&#10;| Real&#45;Time Whole&#45;Body Control of Legged Robots with Model&#45;Predictive Path&#10; &#160;Integral Control | Juan Alvarez&#45;Padilla, John Z.

F. Lizarraga, Flavia M. D. Marquitti, Marcus A. M. de Aguiar | &#160;&#160;We investigate the role of assortative mating in speciation using the&#10;sympatric model of Derrida and Higgs. The model explores the idea that genetic&#10;differences create incompatibilities between individuals, preventing mating if&#10;the number of such differences is too large. Speciation, however, only happens&#10;in this mating system if the number of genes is large. Here we show that&#10;speciation with small genome sizes can occur if assortative mating is&#10;introduced. In our model individuals are represented by three chromosomes: one&#10;responsible for reproductive compatibility, one for coding the trait on which&#10;assortativity will operate, and a neutral chromosome. Reproduction is possible&#10;if individuals are genetically similar with respect to the first chromosome,&#10;but among these compatible mating partners, the one with the most similar trait&#10;coded by the second chromosome is selected. We show that this type of&#10;assortativity facilitates speciation, which can happen with a small number of&#10;genes in the first chromosome. Species, classified according to reproductive&#10;isolation, dictated by the first chromosome, can display different traits&#10;values, as measured by the second and the third chromosomes. Therefore, species&#10;can also be identified based on similarity of the neutral trait, which works as&#10;a proxy for reproductive isolation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10466v1) |&#10;| A stabilized total pressure&#45;formulation of the Biot&#39;s poroelasticity&#10; &#160;equations in frequency domain: numerical analysis and applications | Cristian Cárcamo, Alfonso Caiazzo, Felipe Galarce, Joaquín Mura | &#160;&#160;This work focuses on the numerical solution of the dynamics of a poroelastic&#10;material in the frequency domain. We provide a detailed stability analysis&#10;based on the application of the Fredholm alternative in the continuous case,&#10;considering a total pressure formulation of the Biot&#39;s equations. In the&#10;discrete setting, we propose a stabilized equal order finite element method&#10;complemented by an additional pressure stabilization to enhance the robustness&#10;of the numerical scheme with respect to the fluid permeability. Utilizing the&#10;Fredholm alternative, we extend the well&#45;posedness results to the discrete&#10;setting, obtaining theoretical optimal convergence for the case of linear&#10;finite elements. We present different numerical experiments to validate the&#10;proposed method. First, we consider model problems with known analytic&#10;solutions in two and three dimensions. As next, we show that the method is&#10;robust for a wide range of permeabilities, including the case of discontinuous&#10;coefficients. Lastly, we show the application for the simulation of brain&#10;elastography on a realistic brain geometry obtained from medical imaging.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10465v1) |&#10;| New Direct Sum Tests | Alek Westover, Edward Yu, Kai Zheng | &#160;&#160;A function $f:[n]^{d} to mathbb{F}_2$ is a defn{direct sum} if there are&#10;functions $L_i:[n]to mathbb{F}_2$ such that ${f(x) = sum_{i}L_i(x_i)}$. In&#10;this work we give multiple results related to the property testing of direct&#10;sums.&#10; &#160;Our first result concerns a test proposed by Dinur and Golubev in 2019. We&#10;call their test the Diamond test and show that it is indeed a direct sum&#10;tester. More specifically, we show that if a function $f$ is $epsilon$&#45;far&#10;from being a direct sum function, then the Diamond test rejects $f$ with&#10;probability at least $Omega_{n,epsilon}(1)$. Even in the case of $n = 2$, the&#10;Diamond test is, to the best of our knowledge, novel and yields a new tester&#10;for the classic property of affinity.&#10; &#160;Apart from the Diamond test, we also analyze a broad family of direct sum&#10;tests, which at a high level, run an arbitrary affinity test on the restriction&#10;of $f$ to a random hypercube inside of $[n]^d$. This family of tests includes&#10;the direct sum test analyzed in cite{di19}, but does not include the Diamond&#10;test. As an application of our result, we obtain a direct sum test which works&#10;in the online adversary model of cite{KRV}.&#10; &#160;Finally, we also discuss a Fourier analytic interpretation of the diamond&#10;tester in the $n=2$ case, as well as prove local correction results for direct&#10;sum as conjectured by Dinur and Golubev.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10464v1) |&#10;| Kolmogorov&#45;Arnold Networks in Low&#45;Data Regimes: A Comparative Study with&#10; &#160;Multilayer Perceptrons | Farhad Pourkamali&#45;Anaraki | &#160;&#160;Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) have long been a cornerstone in deep learning,&#10;known for their capacity to model complex relationships. Recently,&#10;Kolmogorov&#45;Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a compelling alternative,&#10;utilizing highly flexible learnable activation functions directly on network&#10;edges, a departure from the neuron&#45;centric approach of MLPs. However, KANs&#10;significantly increase the number of learnable parameters, raising concerns&#10;about their effectiveness in data&#45;scarce environments. This paper presents a&#10;comprehensive comparative study of MLPs and KANs from both algorithmic and&#10;experimental perspectives, with a focus on low&#45;data regimes. We introduce an&#10;effective technique for designing MLPs with unique, parameterized activation&#10;functions for each neuron, enabling a more balanced comparison with KANs. Using&#10;empirical evaluations on simulated data and two real&#45;world data sets from&#10;medicine and engineering, we explore the trade&#45;offs between model complexity&#10;and accuracy, with particular attention to the role of network depth. Our&#10;findings show that MLPs with individualized activation functions achieve&#10;significantly higher predictive accuracy with only a modest increase in&#10;parameters, especially when the sample size is limited to around one hundred.&#10;For example, in a three&#45;class classification problem within additive&#10;manufacturing, MLPs achieve a median accuracy of 0.91, significantly&#10;outperforming KANs, which only reach a median accuracy of 0.53 with default&#10;hyperparameters. These results offer valuable insights into the impact of&#10;activation function selection in neural networks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10463v1) |&#10;| Effects of synapse location, delay and background stochastic activity on&#10; &#160;synchronising hippocampal CA1 neurons | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore | &#160;&#160;We study the synchronisation of neurons in a realistic model under the&#10;Hodgkin&#45;Huxley dynamics. To focus on the role of the different locations of the&#10;excitatory synapses, we use two identical neurons where the set of input&#10;signals is grouped at two different distances from the soma. The system is&#10;intended to represent a CA1 hippocampal neuron in which the synapses arriving&#10;from the CA3 neurons of the trisynaptic pathway appear to be localised in the&#10;apical dendritic region and are, in principle, either proximal or distal to the&#10;soma. Synchronisation is studied using a specifically defined spiking&#10;correlation function as a function of various parameters such as the distance&#10;from the soma of one of the synaptic groups, the inhibition weight and the&#10;associated activation delay. We found that the neurons&#39; spiking activity&#10;depends nonmonotonically on the relative dendritic location of the synapses and&#10;their inhibitory weight, whereas the synchronisation measure always decreases&#10;with inhibition, and strongly depends on its activation time delay. The&#10;background activity on the somas results essentially independent on the&#10;fluctuation intensity and strongly support the importance of the balance&#10;between inhibition and excitation for neuronal synchronization.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10460v1) |&#10;| Efficiently Crowdsourcing Visual Importance with Punch&#45;Hole Annotation | Minsuk Chang, Soohyun Lee, Aeri Cho, Hyeon Jeon, Seokhyeon Park, Cindy Xiong Bearfield, Jinwook Seo | &#160;&#160;We introduce a novel crowdsourcing method for identifying important areas in&#10;graphical images through punch&#45;hole labeling. Traditional methods, such as gaze&#10;trackers and mouse&#45;based annotations, which generate continuous data, can be&#10;impractical in crowdsourcing scenarios. They require many participants, and the&#10;outcome data can be noisy. In contrast, our method first segments the graphical&#10;image with a grid and drops a portion of the patches (punch holes). Then, we&#10;iteratively ask the labeler to validate each annotation with holes, narrowing&#10;down the annotation only having the most important area. This approach aims to&#10;reduce annotation noise in crowdsourcing by standardizing the annotations while&#10;enhancing labeling efficiency and reliability. Preliminary findings from&#10;fundamental charts demonstrate that punch&#45;hole labeling can effectively&#10;pinpoint critical regions. This also highlights its potential for broader&#10;application in visualization research, particularly in studying large&#45;scale&#10;users&#39; graphical perception. Our future work aims to enhance the algorithm to&#10;achieve faster labeling speed and prove its utility through large&#45;scale&#10;experiments.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10459v1) |&#10;| Full distribution of local observables in an exactly solvable current&#10; &#160;carrying steady states of a driven XXZ chain | Sandipan Manna, G J Sreejith | &#160;&#160;Current carrying steady states of interacting spins chains exhibit rich&#10;structures generated through an interplay of current induced correlations and&#10;energetic constraints from the Hamiltonian. The XXZ spin chain when coupled to&#10;maximally polarizing Lindblad terms admits an exact solution in a matrix&#10;product state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations&#10;and distributions of simple local spin observables in the non equilibrium&#10;steady state (NESS). We present exact expressions for spin correlators, entropy&#10;per site, cumulant generating functions for distributions of local observables&#10;in the XX limit (Ising anisotropy $Delta=0$). Further, we use the exact MPS&#10;solution in systems with $Delta&gt;0$, to numerically exactly calculate the&#10;entropy, correlations, as well as distributions of spin observables in blocks&#10;as large as $nsim 200$ sites allowing an estimation of the rate functions. The&#10;$z$ magnetization distribution is consistant with short range spin correlations&#10;in the $z$ direction while the $x$&#45;magnetization shows a double peak structure&#10;at larger $Delta$ suggesting short range ferromagnetic ordering. We find that&#10;the distribution of $z$&#45;magnetization sharpens for parameters where the current&#10;is maximized.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10458v1) |&#10;| Mean Residual Life Ageing Intensity Function | Ashutosh Singh, Ishapathik Das, Asok Kumar Nanda, Sumen Sen | &#160;&#160;The ageing intensity function is a powerful analytical tool that provides&#10;valuable insights into the ageing process across diverse domains such as&#10;reliability engineering, actuarial science, and healthcare. Its applications&#10;continue to expand as researchers delve deeper into understanding the complex&#10;dynamics of ageing and its implications for society. One common approach to&#10;defining the ageing intensity function is through the hazard rate or failure&#10;rate function, extensively explored in scholarly literature. Equally&#10;significant to the hazard rate function is the mean residual life function,&#10;which plays a crucial role in analyzing the ageing patterns exhibited by units&#10;or components. This article introduces the mean residual life ageing intensity&#10;(MRLAI) function to delve into component ageing behaviours across various&#10;distributions. Additionally, we scrutinize the closure properties of the MRLAI&#10;function across different reliability operations. Furthermore, a new order&#10;termed the mean residual life ageing intensity order is defined to analyze the&#10;ageing behaviour of a system, and the closure property of this order under&#10;various reliability operations is discussed.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10456v1) |&#10;| Quantile Fourier regressions for decision making under uncertainty | Arash Khojaste, Geoffrey Pritchard, Golbon Zakeri | &#160;&#160;Weconsider Markov decision processes arising from a Markov model of an&#10;underlying natural phenomenon. Such phenomena are usually periodic (e.g.&#10;annual) in time, and so the Markov processes modelling them must be&#10;time&#45;inhomogeneous, with cyclostationary rather than stationary behaviour. We&#10;describe a technique for constructing such processes that allows for periodic&#10;variations both in the values taken by the process and in the serial dependence&#10;structure. We include two illustrative numerical examples: a hydropower&#10;scheduling problem and a model of offshore wind power integration.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10455v1) |&#10;| The Debiased Near&#45;Earth Object Population from ATLAS Telescopes | Rogerio Deienno, Larry Denneau, David Nesvorný, David Vokrouhlický, William F. Bottke, Robert Jedicke, Shantanu Naidu, Steven R. Chesley, Davide Farnocchia, Paul W. Chodas | &#160;&#160;This work is dedicated to debias the Near&#45;Earth Objects (NEO) population&#10;based on observations from the Asteroid Terrestrial&#45;impact Last Alert System&#10;(ATLAS) telescopes. We have applied similar methods used to develop the&#10;recently released NEO model generator (NEOMOD), once debiasing the NEO&#10;population using data from Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) G96 telescope. ATLAS is&#10;composed of four different telescopes. We first analyzed observational data&#10;from each of all four telescopes separately and later combined them. Our&#10;results highlight main differences between CSS and ATLAS, e.g., sky coverage&#10;and survey power at debiasing the NEO population. ATLAS has a much larger sky&#10;coverage than CSS, allowing it to find bright NEOs that would be constantly&#10;&quot;hiding&quot; from CSS. Consequently, ATLAS is more powerful than CSS at debiasing&#10;the NEO population for H $&#10;esssim$ 19. With its intrinsically greater&#10;sensitivity and emphasis on observing near opposition, CSS excels in the&#10;debiasing of smaller objects. ATLAS, as an all sky survey designed to find&#10;imminent hazardous objects, necessarily spends a significant fraction of time&#10;looking at places on the sky where objects do not appear, reducing its power&#10;for debiasing the population of small objects. We estimate a NEO population&#10;completeness of $approx$ 88%$^{+3%}_{&#45;2%}$ for H $&lt;$ 17.75 and $approx$&#10;36%$^{+1%}_{&#45;1%}$ for H $&lt;$ 22.25. Those numbers are similar to previous&#10;estimates (within error bars for H $&lt;$ 17.75) from CSS, yet, around 3% and 8%&#10;smaller at their face values, respectively. We also confirm previous finding&#10;that the $&#10;u_6$ secular resonance is the main source of small and faint NEOs&#10;at H = 28, whereas the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter dominates for&#10;larger and brighter NEOs at H = 15.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10453v1) |&#10;| Signed Graph Autoencoder for Explainable and Polarization&#45;Aware Network&#10; &#160;Embeddings | Nikolaos Nakis, Chrysoula Kosma, Giannis Nikolentzos, Michalis Chatzianastasis, Iakovos Evdaimon, Michalis Vazirgiannis | &#160;&#160;Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant&#10;attention in recent years for their ability to extract informative latent&#10;representations, characterizing the structure of complex topologies, such as&#10;graphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited&#10;focus on developing and evaluating explainable neural&#45;based graph generative&#10;models specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we&#10;propose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE&#10;extracts node&#45;level representations that express node memberships over distinct&#10;extreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is&#10;achieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its&#10;polarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for&#10;analyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with&#10;relational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation&#10;demonstrates the SGAAEs&#39; capability to successfully infer node memberships over&#10;the different underlying latent structures while extracting competing&#10;communities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the&#10;network. Additionally, we introduce the 2&#45;level network polarization problem&#10;and show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model&#10;achieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across&#10;four real&#45;world datasets, outperforming several baseline models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10452v1) |&#10;| Why you should also use OLS estimation of tail exponents | Thiago Trafane Oliveira Santos, Daniel Oliveira Cajueiro | &#160;&#160;Even though practitioners often estimate Pareto exponents running OLS&#10;rank&#45;size regressions, the usual recommendation is to use the Hill MLE with a&#10;small&#45;sample correction instead, due to its unbiasedness and efficiency. In&#10;this paper, we advocate that you should also apply OLS in empirical&#10;applications. On the one hand, we demonstrate that, with a small&#45;sample&#10;correction, the OLS estimator is also unbiased. On the other hand, we show that&#10;the MLE assigns significantly greater weight to smaller observations. This&#10;suggests that the OLS estimator may outperform the MLE in cases where the&#10;distribution is (i) strictly Pareto but only in the upper tail or (ii)&#10;regularly varying rather than strictly Pareto. We substantiate our theoretical&#10;findings with Monte Carlo simulations and real&#45;world applications,&#10;demonstrating the practical relevance of the OLS method in estimating tail&#10;exponents.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10448v1) |&#10;| Hydrodynamic hovering of swimming bacteria above surfaces | Pyae Hein Htet, Debasish Das, Eric Lauga | &#160;&#160;Flagellated bacteria are hydrodynamically attracted to rigid walls, yet past&#10;work shows a &#39;hovering&#39; state where they swim stably at a finite height above&#10;surfaces. We use numerics and theory to reveal the physical origin of hovering.&#10;Simulations first show that hovering requires an elongated cell body and&#10;results from a tilt away from the wall. Theoretical models then identify two&#10;essential asymmetries: the response of width&#45;asymmetric cells to active flows&#10;created by length&#45;asymmetric cells. A minimal model reconciles near and&#10;far&#45;field hydrodynamics, capturing all key features of hovering.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10447v1) |&#10;| KoroT&#45;3E: A Personalized Musical Mnemonics Tool for Enhancing Memory&#10; &#160;Retention of Complex Computer Science Concepts | Xiangzhe Yuan, Jiajun Wang, Siying Hu, Andrew Cheung, Zhicong Lu | &#160;&#160;As the demand for computer science (CS) skills grows, mastering foundational&#10;concepts is crucial yet challenging for novice learners. To address this&#10;challenge, we present KoroT&#45;3E, an AI&#45;based system that creates personalized&#10;musical mnemonics to enhance both memory retention and understanding of&#10;concepts in CS. KoroT&#45;3E enables users to transform complex concepts into&#10;memorable lyrics and compose melodies that suit their musical preferences. We&#10;conducted semi&#45;structured interviews (n=12) to investigate why novice learners&#10;find it challenging to memorize and understand CS concepts. The findings,&#10;combined with constructivist learning theory, established our initial design,&#10;which was then refined following consultations with CS education experts. An&#10;empirical experiment(n=36) showed that those using KoroT&#45;3E (n=18)&#10;significantly outperformed the control group (n=18), with improved memory&#10;efficiency, increased motivation, and a positive learning experience. These&#10;findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating multimodal generative AI&#10;into CS education to create personalized and interactive learning experiences.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10446v1) |&#10;| Deep&#45;Wide Learning Assistance for Insect Pest Classification | Toan Nguyen, Huy Nguyen, Huy Ung, Hieu Ung, Binh Nguyen | &#160;&#160;Accurate insect pest recognition plays a critical role in agriculture. It is&#10;a challenging problem due to the intricate characteristics of insects. In this&#10;paper, we present DeWi, novel learning assistance for insect pest&#10;classification. With a one&#45;stage and alternating training strategy, DeWi&#10;simultaneously improves several Convolutional Neural Networks in two&#10;perspectives: discrimination (by optimizing a triplet margin loss in a&#10;supervised training manner) and generalization (via data augmentation). From&#10;that, DeWi can learn discriminative and in&#45;depth features of insect pests&#10;(deep) yet still generalize well to a large number of insect categories (wide).&#10;Experimental results show that DeWi achieves the highest performances on two&#10;insect pest classification benchmarks (76.44% accuracy on the IP102 dataset&#10;and 99.79% accuracy on the D0 dataset, respectively). In addition, extensive&#10;evaluations and ablation studies are conducted to thoroughly investigate our&#10;DeWi and demonstrate its superiority.

Behavior trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robot&#10;task planning for their modularity and flexibility, but manually designing them&#10;can be effort&#45;intensive. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been&#10;applied in robotic task planning for generating action sequences, but their&#10;ability to generate BTs has not been fully investigated. To this end, We&#10;propose LLM as BT&#45;planner, a novel framework to leverage LLMs for BT generation&#10;in robotic assembly task planning and execution. Four in&#45;context learning&#10;methods are introduced to utilize the natural language processing and inference&#10;capabilities of LLMs to produce task plans in BT format, reducing manual effort&#10;and ensuring robustness and comprehensibility. We also evaluate the performance&#10;of fine&#45;tuned, fewer&#45;parameter LLMs on the same tasks. Experiments in simulated&#10;and real&#45;world settings show that our framework enhances LLMs&#39; performance in&#10;BT generation, improving success rates in BT generation through in&#45;context&#10;learning and supervised fine&#45;tuning.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10444v1) |&#10;| The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration. II.&#10; &#160;Mid&#45;Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy | Karl D. Gordon, G. C. Sloan, Macarena Garcia Marin, Mattia Libralato, George Rieke, Jonathan A. Aguilar, Ralph Bohlin, Misty Cracraft, Marjorie Decleir, Andras Gaspar, David R. Law, Alberto Noriega&#45;Crespo, Michael Regan | &#160;&#160;The absolute flux calibration of the Mid&#45;Infrared Instrument Imaging and&#10;Coronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first&#10;2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the&#10;flux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays,&#10;and different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining&#10;observed aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions&#10;based on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of&#10;these observations were combined with model point&#45;spread&#45;functions to measure&#10;the corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with&#10;time, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time,&#10;rate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations&#10;were with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately&#10;every month revealed a modest time&#45;dependent response loss seen mainly at the&#10;longest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential&#10;with a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the&#10;band&#45;dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was&#10;found to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different&#10;subarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting&#10;for the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors&#10;measured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The&#10;formal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are&#10;0.3 to 1.0%, with longer&#45;wavelength bands generally having larger&#10;uncertainties.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10443v1) |&#10;| CtRNet&#45;X: Camera&#45;to&#45;Robot Pose Estimation in Real&#45;world Conditions Using&#10; &#160;a Single Camera | Jingpei Lu, Zekai Liang, Tristin Xie, Florian Ritcher, Shan Lin, Sainan Liu, Michael C. Yip | &#160;&#160;Camera&#45;to&#45;robot calibration is crucial for vision&#45;based robot control and&#10;requires effort to make it accurate. Recent advancements in markerless pose&#10;estimation methods have eliminated the need for time&#45;consuming physical setups&#10;for camera&#45;to&#45;robot calibration. While the existing markerless pose estimation&#10;methods have demonstrated impressive accuracy without the need for cumbersome&#10;setups, they rely on the assumption that all the robot joints are visible&#10;within the camera&#39;s field of view. However, in practice, robots usually move in&#10;and out of view, and some portion of the robot may stay out&#45;of&#45;frame during the&#10;whole manipulation task due to real&#45;world constraints, leading to a lack of&#10;sufficient visual features and subsequent failure of these approaches. To&#10;address this challenge and enhance the applicability to vision&#45;based robot&#10;control, we propose a novel framework capable of estimating the robot pose with&#10;partially visible robot manipulators. Our approach leverages the&#10;Vision&#45;Language Models for fine&#45;grained robot components detection, and&#10;integrates it into a keypoint&#45;based pose estimation network, which enables more&#10;robust performance in varied operational conditions. The framework is evaluated&#10;on both public robot datasets and self&#45;collected partial&#45;view datasets to&#10;demonstrate our robustness and generalizability. As a result, this method is&#10;effective for robot pose estimation in a wider range of real&#45;world manipulation&#10;scenarios.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10441v1) |&#10;| Successive topological phase transitions in two distinct spin&#45;flop&#10; &#160;phases on the honeycomb lattice | Xudong Li, Jize Zhao, Jinbin Li, Qiang Luo | &#160;&#160;The Kitaev magnets with bond&#45;dependent interactions have garnered&#10;considerable attention in recent years for their ability to harbor exotic&#10;phases and nontrivial excitations. The topological magnons, which are indicated&#10;by nonzero Chern number and thermal Hall conductivity, are proposed to&#10;partially explain thermal Hall measurements in real materials. Hitherto,&#10;topological magnons have been extensively explored when the magnetic field is&#10;normal to the honeycomb plane, but their topological characteristics are less&#10;studied in the presence of in&#45;plane magnetic field. Here, we study two distinct&#10;in&#45;plane field induced spin&#45;flop phases in the $Gamma$&#45;$Gamma&#39;$ model, both&#10;of which are off&#45;diagonal couplings that have intimate relation to the Kitaev&#10;interaction. The two spin&#45;flop phases are distinguished by their out&#45;of&#45;plane&#10;spin components which can be either antiparallel or parallel, thus dubbing&#10;antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) spin&#45;flop phases, respectively.&#10;We map out topological phase diagrams for both phases, revealing a rich pattern&#10;of the Chern number over exchange parameters and magnetic field. We&#10;analytically calculate the boundaries of topological phase transitions when the&#10;magnetic field is along the $a$ and $b$ directions. We find that the thermal&#10;Hall conductivity and its derivative display contrasting behaviors when&#10;crossing different topological phase transitions. The striking difference of&#10;the two phases lies in that when the magnetic field is along the $b$ direction,&#10;topological magnons are totally absent in the AFM spin&#45;flop phase, while they&#10;can survive in the FM analogue in certain parameter regions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10439v1) |&#10;| A functorial approach to $n$&#45;abelian categories | Vitor Gulisz | &#160;&#160;We develop a functorial approach to the study of $n$&#45;abelian categories by&#10;reformulating their axioms in terms of their categories of finitely presented&#10;functors. Such an approach allows the use of classical homological algebra and&#10;representation theory techniques to understand higher homological algebra.

We also specialize our results to modules&#10;over rings, thereby describing when the category of finitely generated&#10;projective modules over a ring is $n$&#45;abelian. Moreover, we establish a&#10;correspondence for $n$&#45;abelian categories with additive generators, which&#10;extends the higher Auslander correspondence.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10438v1) |&#10;| Color symmetry breaking in the Potts spin glass | Jean&#45;Christophe Mourrat | &#160;&#160;The Potts spin glass is an analogue of the Sherrington&#45;Kirkpatrick model in&#10;which each spin can take one of $kappa$ possible values, which we interpret as&#10;colors.

The vast majority of&#10;energy&#45;preserving reduced&#45;order methods use symplectic Galerkin projection to&#10;construct reduced&#45;order Hamiltonian models by projecting the full models onto a&#10;symplectic subspace. However, symplectic projection requires the existence of&#10;fully discrete operators, and in many cases, such as black&#45;box PDE solvers,&#10;these operators are inaccessible. In this work, we propose an energy&#45;preserving&#10;machine learning method that can infer the dynamics of the given PDE using data&#10;only, so that the proposed framework does not depend on the fully discrete&#10;operators. In this context, the proposed method is non&#45;intrusive. The proposed&#10;method is grey box in the sense that it requires only some basic knowledge of&#10;the multi&#45;symplectic model at the partial differential equation level. We prove&#10;that the proposed method satisfies spatially discrete local energy conservation&#10;and preserves the multi&#45;symplectic conservation laws. We test our method on the&#10;linear wave equation, the Korteweg&#45;de Vries equation, and the&#10;Zakharov&#45;Kuznetsov equation.

To&#10;focus on the role of different excitatory positions, we use two copies of the&#10;same neuron whose synapses are located at different distances from the soma and&#10;are exposed to identical Poissonian distributed current pulses. The&#10;synchronization is investigated through a specifically defined spiking&#10;correlation function, and its behavior is analyzed as a function of several&#10;parameters: inhibition weight, distance from the soma of one synaptic group,&#10;excitatory inactivation delay, and weight of the excitatory synapses.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10431v1) |&#10;| Meta&#45;Whisper: Speech&#45;Based Meta&#45;ICL for ASR on Low&#45;Resource Languages | Ming&#45;Hao Hsu, Kuan Po Huang, Hung&#45;yi Lee | &#160;&#160;This paper presents Meta&#45;Whisper, a novel approach to improve automatic&#10;speech recognition (ASR) for low&#45;resource languages using the Whisper model. By&#10;leveraging Meta In&#45;Context Learning (Meta&#45;ICL) and a k&#45;Nearest Neighbors (KNN)&#10;algorithm for sample selection, Meta&#45;Whisper enhances Whisper&#39;s ability to&#10;recognize speech in unfamiliar languages without extensive fine&#45;tuning.&#10;Experiments on the ML&#45;SUPERB dataset show that Meta&#45;Whisper significantly&#10;reduces the Character Error Rate (CER) for low&#45;resource languages compared to&#10;the original Whisper model. This method offers a promising solution for&#10;developing more adaptable multilingual ASR systems, particularly for languages&#10;with limited resources.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10429v1) |&#10;| User&#45;Authenticated Device&#45;Independent Quantum Secure Direct&#10; &#160;Communication Protocol | Nayana Das, Saikat Basu, Goutam Paul, Vijay S. Rao | &#160;&#160;Device&#45;Independent Quantum Secure Direct Communication (DI&#45;QSDC) enhances&#10;quantum cryptography by enabling secure message transmission without relying on&#10;the trustworthiness of the devices involved. This approach mitigates risks&#10;associated with compromised or untrusted devices, common in traditional quantum&#10;communication.&#10; &#160;In this paper, we propose the first of its kind DI&#45;QSDC protocol with user&#10;identity authentication. This ensures the authenticity of both the sender and&#10;receiver prior to message exchange. We then discuss the security of the&#10;proposed protocol against common attacks, demonstrating that no eavesdropper&#10;gains any information from either the quantum or the classical channel. Next,&#10;we implement the protocol on IBM&#39;s quantum hardware and evaluate its&#10;performance in a realistic noisy environment. Additionally, by simulating&#10;common attack models, we showcase that the protocol is secure against any&#10;eavesdropper in the channel. These findings highlight the protocol&#39;s robust&#10;security and practical feasibility for real&#45;world secure quantum communication.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10427v1) |&#10;| Role of kinematic constraints in the time reversal symmetry breaking of&#10; &#160;a model active matter | Soumen Das, Shankar Ghosh, Tridib Sadhu, Juliane U Klamser | &#160;&#160;Active&#45;matter systems are inherently out&#45;of&#45;equilibrium and perform&#10;mechanical work by utilizing their internal energy sources. Breakdown of&#10;time&#45;reversal symmetry (BTRS) is a hallmark of such dissipative non&#45;equilibrium&#10;dynamics. We introduce a robust, experimentally accessible, noninvasive,&#10;quantitative measure of BTRS in terms of the Kullback&#45;Leibler divergence in&#10;collision events, demonstrated in our novel artificial active matter, comprised&#10;of battery&#45;powered spherical rolling robots whose energetics in different modes&#10;of motion can be measured with high precision. Our dimensionless measure&#10;characterizes how dissipation and internal energetics are influenced by&#10;kinematic constraints from interactions with the environment. We propose this&#10;measure of BTRS as an empirical estimate of the distance from equilibrium. An&#10;energetic insight into this departure of active matter from equilibrium comes&#10;from our demonstration of a non&#45;trivial fluctuation symmetry, which reveals a&#10;potentially universal thermodynamic characteristic of active energetics. As a&#10;many&#45;body consequence of BTRS in our experimental active system, we demonstrate&#10;the emergence of activity&#45;induced herding, which has no equilibrium analogue.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10425v1) |&#10;| Unveiling V Modes: Enhancing CMB Sensitivity to BSM Physics with a&#10; &#160;Non&#45;Ideal Half&#45;Wave Plate | N. Raffuzzi, M. Lembo, S. Giardiello, M. Gerbino, M. Lattanzi, P. Natoli, L. Pagano | &#160;&#160;V&#45;mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background is expected to be&#10;vanishingly small in the $Lambda$CDM model and, hence, usually ignored.&#10;Nonetheless, several astrophysical effects, as well as beyond standard model&#10;physics could produce it at a detectable level. A realistic half&#45;wave plate &#45;&#10;an optical element commonly used in CMB experiments to modulate the polarized&#10;signal &#45; can provide sensitivity to V modes without significantly spoiling that&#10;to linear polarization. We assess this sensitivity for some new&#45;generation CMB&#10;experiments, such as the LiteBIRD satellite, the ground&#45;based Simons&#10;Observatory and a CMB&#45;S4&#45;like experiment. We forecast the efficiency of these&#10;experiments to constrain the phenomenology of certain classes of BSM models&#10;inducing mixing of linear polarization states and generation of V modes in the&#10;CMB. We find that new&#45;generation experiments can improve current limits by&#10;1&#45;to&#45;3 orders of magnitude, depending on the data combination. The inclusion of&#10;V&#45;mode information dramatically boosts the sensitivity to these BSM models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10424v1) |&#10;| Initial data for a deformed isolated horizon | Aleš Flandera, David Kofroň, Tomáš Ledvinka | &#160;&#160;Within the isolated horizon formalism, we investigate a static axisymmetric&#10;space&#45;time of a black hole influenced by matter in its neighborhood. To&#10;illustrate the role of ingredients and assumptions in this formalism, we first&#10;show how, in spherical symmetry, the field equations and gauge conditions imply&#10;the isolated horizon initial data leading to the Schwarzschild space&#45;time.&#10;Then, we construct the initial data for a static axisymmetric isolated horizon&#10;representing a deformed black hole. The space&#45;time description in the&#10;Bondi&#45;like coordinates is then found as a series expansion in the vicinity of&#10;the horizon. To graphically illustrate this construction, we also find a&#10;numerical solution for a black hole deformed by a particular analytic model of&#10;a thin accretion disk. We also discuss how an accretion disk affects the&#10;analytical properties of the horizon geometry.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10423v1) |&#10;| Learning Semi&#45;Supervised Medical Image Segmentation from Spatial&#10; &#160;Registration | Qianying Liu, Paul Henderson, Xiao Gu, Hang Dai, Fani Deligianni | &#160;&#160;Semi&#45;supervised medical image segmentation has shown promise in training&#10;models with limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. However,&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methods ignore a potentially valuable source of unsupervised&#10;semantic information &#45;&#45; spatial registration transforms between image volumes.&#10;To address this, we propose CCT&#45;R, a contrastive cross&#45;teaching framework&#10;incorporating registration information. To leverage the semantic information&#10;available in registrations between volume pairs, CCT&#45;R incorporates two&#10;proposed modules: Registration Supervision Loss (RSL) and Registration&#45;Enhanced&#10;Positive Sampling (REPS). The RSL leverages segmentation knowledge derived from&#10;transforms between labeled and unlabeled volume pairs, providing an additional&#10;source of pseudo&#45;labels. REPS enhances contrastive learning by identifying&#10;anatomically&#45;corresponding positives across volumes using registration&#10;transforms. Experimental results on two challenging medical segmentation&#10;benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CCT&#45;R across&#10;various semi&#45;supervised settings, with as few as one labeled case.

A number of recent methods have shown&#10;how to perform high&#45;dimensional, unbinned unfolding using machine learning.&#10;However, one of the assumptions in all of these methods is that the detector&#10;response is accurately modeled in the Monte Carlo simulation. In practice, the&#10;detector response depends on a number of nuisance parameters that can be&#10;constrained with data. We propose a new algorithm called Profile OmniFold&#10;(POF), which works in a similar iterative manner as the OmniFold (OF) algorithm&#10;while being able to simultaneously profile the nuisance parameters. We&#10;illustrate the method with a Gaussian example as a proof of concept&#10;highlighting its promising capabilities.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10421v1) |&#10;| HiFi&#45;CS: Towards Open Vocabulary Visual Grounding For Robotic Grasping&#10; &#160;Using Vision&#45;Language Models | Vineet Bhat, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Ramesh Karri, Farshad Khorrami | &#160;&#160;Robots interacting with humans through natural language can unlock numerous&#10;applications such as Referring Grasp Synthesis (RGS). Given a text query, RGS&#10;determines a stable grasp pose to manipulate the referred object in the robot&#39;s&#10;workspace. RGS comprises two steps: visual grounding and grasp pose estimation.&#10;Recent studies leverage powerful Vision&#45;Language Models (VLMs) for visually&#10;grounding free&#45;flowing natural language in real&#45;world robotic execution.&#10;However, comparisons in complex, cluttered environments with multiple instances&#10;of the same object are lacking. This paper introduces HiFi&#45;CS, featuring&#10;hierarchical application of Featurewise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to fuse image&#10;and text embeddings, enhancing visual grounding for complex attribute rich text&#10;queries encountered in robotic grasping. Visual grounding associates an object&#10;in 2D/3D space with natural language input and is studied in two scenarios:&#10;Closed and Open Vocabulary. HiFi&#45;CS features a lightweight decoder combined&#10;with a frozen VLM and outperforms competitive baselines in closed vocabulary&#10;settings while being 100x smaller in size. Our model can effectively guide&#10;open&#45;set object detectors like GroundedSAM to enhance open&#45;vocabulary&#10;performance. We validate our approach through real&#45;world RGS experiments using&#10;a 7&#45;DOF robotic arm, achieving 90.33% visual grounding accuracy in 15 tabletop&#10;scenes.

Papoutsis, I. E. Papadakis, C. Panagiotou, M. Dovčiak, E. Kammoun | &#160;&#160;Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to be variable across all&#10;wavelengths. Significant observational efforts have been invested in the last&#10;decade in studying their ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability. Long and&#10;densely sampled, multi&#45;wavelength monitoring campaigns of numerous Seyfert&#10;galaxies have been conducted with the aim of determining the X&#45;ray/UV/optical&#10;continuum time lags. Time&#45;lag studies can be used to constrain theoretical&#10;models. The observed time lags can be explained by thermal reprocessing of the&#10;X&#45;rays illuminating the accretion disc (known as the X&#45;ray reverberation&#10;model). However, the observed light curves contain more information that can be&#10;used to further constrain physical models. Our primary objective is to&#10;investigate whether, in addition to time lags, the X&#45;ray reverberation model&#10;can also explain the UV/optical variability amplitude of nearby Seyferts. To do&#10;this, we measured the excess variance of four sources (namely Mrk 509, NGC&#10;4151, NGC 2617, and Mrk 142) as a function of wavelength using data from&#10;archival long, multi&#45;wavelength campaigns with Swift, and ground&#45;based&#10;telescopes. We also computed the model excess variance in the case of the X&#45;ray&#10;reverberation model by determining the disc&#39;s transfer function and assuming a&#10;bending power law for the X&#45;ray power spectrum. We tested the validity of the&#10;model by comparing the measured and model variances for a range of accretion&#10;rates and X&#45;ray source heights. We conclude that the X&#45;ray thermal&#10;reverberation model can fit both the continuum, UV/optical time lags, as well&#10;as the variance in these AGNs, for the same physical parameters. Our results&#10;suggest that the accretion disc is constant and that all the observed&#10;UV/optical variations, on timescales of days and up to a few weeks, can be&#10;fully explained by the variable X&#45;rays as they illuminate the accretion disc.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10417v1) |&#10;| Local central limit theorem for Mallows measure | Alexey Bufetov, Kailun Chen | &#160;&#160;We study the statistics of the Mallows measure on permutations in the limit&#10;pioneered by Starr (2009).

We also re&#45;derive versions of the law of large numbers&#10;and the large deviation principle, obtain the standard central limit theorem&#10;from the local one, and establish a multi&#45;point version of the local central&#10;limit theorem.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10415v1) |&#10;| On interactive anisotropic walks in two dimensions generated from a&#10; &#160;three state opinion dynamics model | Surajit Saha, Parongama Sen | &#160;&#160;A system of interacting walkers on a two&#45;dimensional space where the dynamics&#10;of each walker are governed by the opinions of agents of a three&#45;state opinion&#10;dynamics model are considered. Such walks, inspired by Ising&#45;like models and&#10;opinions dynamics models, are usually considered in one&#45;dimensional virtual&#10;spaces. Here, the mapping is done in such a way that the walk is directed along&#10;the $y$ axis while it can move either way along the $x$ axis. We explore the&#10;properties of such walks as the parameter representing the noise in the opinion&#10;dynamics model, responsible for a continuous phase transition, is varied. The&#10;walk features show marked differences as the system crosses the critical point.&#10;The bivariate distribution of the displacements below the critical point is a&#10;modified biased Gaussian function of x and y which is symmetric about the X&#10;axis.&#10; &#160;The marginal probability distributions can be extracted and the scaling forms&#10;of different quantities, showing power law behaviour, are obtained. The&#10;directed nature of the walk is reflected in the marginal distributions as well&#10;as in the exponents.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10413v1) |&#10;| A Large&#45;Scale Privacy Assessment of Android Third&#45;Party SDKs | Mark Huasong Meng, Chuan Yan, Yun Hao, Qing Zhang, Zeyu Wang, Kailong Wang, Sin Gee Teo, Guangdong Bai, Jin Song Dong | &#160;&#160;Third&#45;party Software Development Kits (SDKs) are widely adopted in Android&#10;app development, to effortlessly accelerate development pipelines and enhance&#10;app functionality. However, this convenience raises substantial concerns about&#10;unauthorized access to users&#39; privacy&#45;sensitive information, which could be&#10;further abused for illegitimate purposes like user tracking or monetization.&#10;Our study offers a targeted analysis of user privacy protection among Android&#10;third&#45;party SDKs, filling a critical gap in the Android software supply chain.&#10;It focuses on two aspects of their privacy practices, including data&#10;exfiltration and behavior&#45;policy compliance (or privacy compliance), utilizing&#10;techniques of taint analysis and large language models. It covers 158&#10;widely&#45;used SDKs from two key SDK release platforms, the official one and a&#10;large alternative one. From them, we identified 338 instances of privacy data&#10;exfiltration. On the privacy compliance, our study reveals that more than 30%&#10;of the examined SDKs fail to provide a privacy policy to disclose their data&#10;handling practices. Among those that provide privacy policies, 37% of them&#10;over&#45;collect user data, and 88% falsely claim access to sensitive data. We&#10;revisit the latest versions of the SDKs after 12 months. Our analysis&#10;demonstrates a persistent lack of improvement in these concerning trends. Based&#10;on our findings, we propose three actionable recommendations to mitigate the&#10;privacy leakage risks and enhance privacy protection for Android users. Our&#10;research not only serves as an urgent call for industry attention but also&#10;provides crucial insights for future regulatory interventions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10411v1) |&#10;| A point process approach for the classification of noisy calcium imaging&#10; &#160;data | Arianna Burzacchi, Nicoletta D&#39;Angelo, David Payares&#45;Garcia, Jorge Mateu | &#160;&#160;We study noisy calcium imaging data, with a focus on the classification of&#10;spike traces. As raw traces obscure the true temporal structure of neuron&#39;s&#10;activity, we performed a tuned filtering of the calcium concentration using two&#10;methods: a biophysical model and a kernel mapping. The former characterizes&#10;spike trains related to a particular triggering event, while the latter filters&#10;out the signal and refines the selection of the underlying neuronal response.&#10;Transitioning from traditional time series analysis to point process theory,&#10;the study explores spike&#45;time distance metrics and point pattern prototypes to&#10;describe repeated observations. We assume that the analyzed neuron&#39;s firing&#10;events, i.e. spike occurrences, are temporal point process events. In&#10;particular, the study aims to categorize 47 point patterns by depth, assuming&#10;the similarity of spike occurrences within specific depth categories. The&#10;results highlight the pivotal roles of depth and stimuli in discerning diverse&#10;temporal structures of neuron firing events, confirming the point process&#10;approach based on prototype analysis is largely useful in the classification of&#10;spike traces.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10409v1) |&#10;| Variational closures for composite homogenised fluid flows | Theo Diamantakis, Ruiao Hu | &#160;&#160;The Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport is a variational formulation of&#10;stochastic fluid dynamics introduced to model the effects of unresolved scales,&#10;whilst preserving the geometric structure of ideal fluid flows. In this work,&#10;we show that the SALT equations can arise from the decomposition of the fluid&#10;flow map into its mean and fluctuating components. The fluctuating component is&#10;realised as a prescribed stochastic diffeomorphism that introduces stochastic&#10;transport into the system and we construct it using homogenisation theory. The&#10;dynamics of the mean component are derived from a variational principle&#10;utilising particular forms of variations that preserve the composite structure&#10;of the flow. Using a new variational principle, we show that SALT equations can&#10;arise from random Lagrangians and are equivalent to random coefficient PDEs. We&#10;also demonstrate how to modify the composite flow and the associated&#10;variational principle to derive models inspired by the Lagrangian Averaged&#10;Euler&#45;Poincare (LAEP) theory.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10408v1) |&#10;| Bitcoin Transaction Behavior Modeling Based on Balance Data | Yu Zhang, Claudio Tessone | &#160;&#160;When analyzing Bitcoin users&#39; balance distribution, we observed that it&#10;follows a log&#45;normal pattern. Drawing parallels from the successful application&#10;of Gibrat&#39;s law of proportional growth in explaining city size and word&#10;frequency distributions, we tested whether the same principle could account for&#10;the log&#45;normal distribution in Bitcoin balances. However, our calculations&#10;revealed that the exponent parameters in both the drift and variance terms&#10;deviate slightly from one. This suggests that Gibrat&#39;s proportional growth rule&#10;alone does not fully explain the log&#45;normal distribution observed in Bitcoin&#10;users&#39; balances. During our exploration, we discovered an intriguing&#10;phenomenon: Bitcoin users tend to fall into two distinct categories based on&#10;their behavior, which we refer to as ``poor&quot; and ``wealthy&quot; users. Poor users,&#10;who initially purchase only a small amount of Bitcoin, tend to buy more&#10;bitcoins first and then sell out all their holdings gradually over time. The&#10;certainty of selling all their coins is higher and higher with time. In&#10;contrast, wealthy users, who acquire a large amount of Bitcoin from the start,&#10;tend to sell off their holdings over time. The speed at which they sell their&#10;bitcoins is lower and lower over time and they will hold at least a small part&#10;of their initial holdings at last. Interestingly, the wealthier the user, the&#10;larger the proportion of their balance and the higher the certainty they tend&#10;to sell. This research provided an interesting perspective to explore bitcoin&#10;users&#39; behaviors which may apply to other finance markets.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10407v1) |&#10;| Stochastic Data&#45;Driven Predictive Control: Chance&#45;Constraint&#10; &#160;Satisfaction with Identified Multi&#45;step Predictors | Haldun Balim, Andrea Carron, Melanie N. Zeilinger, Johannes Köhler | &#160;&#160;We propose a novel data&#45;driven stochastic model predictive control framework&#10;for uncertain linear systems with noisy output measurements. Our approach&#10;leverages multi&#45;step predictors to efficiently propagate uncertainty, ensuring&#10;chance constraint satisfaction with minimal conservatism. In particular, we&#10;present a strategy to identify multi&#45;step predictors and quantify the&#10;associated uncertainty using a surrogate (data&#45;driven) state space model. Then,&#10;we utilize the derived distribution to formulate a constraint tightening that&#10;ensures chance constraint satisfaction. A numerical example highlights the&#10;reduced conservatism of handling parametric uncertainty in the proposed method&#10;compared to state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art solutions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10405v1) |&#10;| A Knowledge&#45;Enhanced Disease Diagnosis Method Based on Prompt Learning&#10; &#160;and BERT Integration | Zhang Zheng | &#160;&#160;This paper proposes a knowledge&#45;enhanced disease diagnosis method based on a&#10;prompt learning framework. The method retrieves structured knowledge from&#10;external knowledge graphs related to clinical cases, encodes it, and injects it&#10;into the prompt templates to enhance the language model&#39;s understanding and&#10;reasoning capabilities for the task.We conducted experiments on three public&#10;datasets: CHIP&#45;CTC, IMCS&#45;V2&#45;NER, and KUAKE&#45;QTR. The results show that the&#10;proposed method significantly outperforms existing models across multiple&#10;evaluation metrics, with an F1 score improvement of 2.4% on the CHIP&#45;CTC&#10;dataset, 3.1% on the IMCS&#45;V2&#45;NER dataset,and 4.2% on the KUAKE&#45;QTR dataset.&#10;Additionally,ablation studies confirmed the critical role of the knowledge&#10;injection module,as the removal of this module resulted in a significant drop&#10;in F1 score. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not&#10;only effectively improves the accuracy of disease diagnosis but also enhances&#10;the interpretability of the predictions, providing more reliable support and&#10;evidence for clinical diagnosis.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10403v1) |&#10;| A Statistical Equilibrium Approach to Adam Smith&#39;s Labor Theory of Value | Ellis Scharfenaker, Bruno Theodosio, Duncan K.

In meiosis II mouse oocytes (developing egg cells) awaiting&#10;fertilisation, the spindle, which is the protein structure responsible for&#10;dividing genetic material in a cell, must maintain its position near the cell&#10;cortex (the thin actin network bound to the cell membrane) for many hours.&#10;However, the cytoplasmic streaming that accompanies this stable positioning&#10;would intuitively appear to destabilise the spindle position. Here, through a&#10;combination of numerical and analytical modelling, we reveal a new,&#10;hydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning beneath the cortical cap.&#10;We show that this stability depends critically on the spindle size and the&#10;active driving from the cortex, and demonstrate that stable spindle positioning&#10;can result purely from a hydrodynamic suction force exerted on the spindle by&#10;the cytoplasmic flow. Our findings show that local fluid dynamic forces can be&#10;sufficient to stabilise the spindle, explaining robustness against&#10;perturbations not only perpendicular but also parallel to the cortex. Our&#10;results shed light on the importance of cytoplasmic streaming in mammalian&#10;meiosis.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10401v1) |&#10;| Sherpa: An Open Source Python Fitting Package | Aneta Siemiginowska, Douglas Burke, Hans Moritz Günther, Nicholas P.

Dejrah | &#160;&#160;We focus on the inflationary predictions of $beta$&#45;exponential potential&#10;models, in which the inflaton is a representation of the field delineating the&#10;size of extra&#45;dimension. Since it offers a well&#45;motivated starting point for&#10;the study of physics at very high energies, we incorporate an $R^2$ term in the&#10;Palatini gravity. In addition, afterward the inflation, the inflaton oscillates&#10;about the minimum of the inflation potential, and reheats the universe. This&#10;occurs during the reheating phase, at which the inflaton decays into the&#10;standard model particles, which fill the universe. We extend our examination by&#10;considering the reheating effects on inflationary observables by employing the&#10;different scenarios of the reheat temperature. Supposing the standard thermal&#10;history after inflation, we display the inflationary predictions, $n_s, r,&#10;mathrm{d}n_s/mathrm{d}&#10;n k$ of $beta$&#45;exponential potential with minimal&#10;coupling in Palatini $R^2$ gravity. Also, different kinds of constraints from a&#10;variety of observations, such as BICEP/Keck, Planck 2018, as well as future&#10;possible detectable sensitivities that might be reached by CMB experiments:&#10;CMB&#45;S4 and LiteBIRD are taken into account in this work. We indicate that our&#10;results are consistent with both the latest data and the future sensitivity&#10;forecasts of LiteBIRD/Planck and CMB&#45;S4. Finally, the results in this study&#10;highlight the viability of our model even in the case of the existence of more&#10;stringent constraints expected from future achievable confidence level limits.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10398v1) |&#10;| Quantifying Observational Projection Effects with a Simulation&#45;based hot&#10; &#160;CGM model | Soumya Shreeram, Johan Comparat, Andrea Merloni, Yi Zhang, Gabriele Ponti, Kirpal Nandra, John ZuHone, Ilaria Marini, Stephan Vladutescu&#45;Zopp, Paola Popesso, Ruediger Pakmor, Riccardo Seppi, Celine Peroux, Daniele Sorini | &#160;&#160;The hot phase of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) allows us to probe the&#10;inflow and outflow of gas within a galaxy, which is responsible for dictating&#10;the evolution of the galaxy. Studying the hot CGM sheds light on a better&#10;understanding of gas physics, which is crucial to inform and constrain&#10;simulation models. With the recent advances in observational measurements&#10;probing the hot CGM in X&#45;rays and tSZ, we have a new avenue for widening our&#10;knowledge of gas physics and feedback by exploiting the information from&#10;current/future observations. In this paper, we use the TNG300 hydrodynamical&#10;simulations to build a fully self&#45;consistent forward model for the hot CGM. We&#10;construct a lightcone and generate mock X&#45;ray observations. We quantify the&#10;projection effects, namely the locally correlated large&#45;scale structure in&#10;X&#45;rays and the effect due to satellite galaxies misclassified as centrals which&#10;affects the measured hot CGM galactocentric profiles in stacking experiments.&#10;We present an analytical model that describes the intrinsic X&#45;ray surface&#10;brightness profile across the stellar and halo mass bins. The increasing&#10;stellar mass bins result in decreasing values of $beta$, the exponent&#10;quantifying the slope of the intrinsic galactocentric profiles. We carry&#10;forward the current state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art by also showing the impact of the locally&#10;correlated environment on the measured X&#45;ray surface brightness profiles. We&#10;also present, for the first time, the effect of misclassified centrals in&#10;stacking experiments for three stellar mass bins: $10^{10.5&#45;11} M_odot$,&#10;$10^{11&#45;11.2} M_odot$, and $10^{11.2&#45;11.5} M_odot$. We find that the&#10;contaminating effect of the misclassified centrals on the stacked profiles&#10;increases when the stellar mass decreases.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10397v1) |&#10;| MOST: MR reconstruction Optimization for multiple downStream Tasks via&#10; &#160;continual learning | Hwihun Jeong, Se Young Chun, Jongho Lee | &#160;&#160;Deep learning&#45;based Magnetic Resonance (MR) reconstruction methods have&#10;focused on generating high&#45;quality images but they often overlook the impact on&#10;downstream tasks (e.g., segmentation) that utilize the reconstructed images.&#10;Cascading separately trained reconstruction network and downstream task network&#10;has been shown to introduce performance degradation due to error propagation&#10;and domain gaps between training datasets. To mitigate this issue, downstream&#10;task&#45;oriented reconstruction optimization has been proposed for a single&#10;downstream task. Expanding this optimization to multi&#45;task scenarios is not&#10;straightforward. In this work, we extended this optimization to sequentially&#10;introduced multiple downstream tasks and demonstrated that a single MR&#10;reconstruction network can be optimized for multiple downstream tasks by&#10;deploying continual learning (MOST). MOST integrated techniques from&#10;replay&#45;based continual learning and image&#45;guided loss to overcome catastrophic&#10;forgetting. Comparative experiments demonstrated that MOST outperformed a&#10;reconstruction network without finetuning, a reconstruction network with&#10;na&quot;ive finetuning, and conventional continual learning methods. This&#10;advancement empowers the application of a single MR reconstruction network for&#10;multiple downstream tasks.

In particular, we analyse the task of&#10;textit{multicopy state teleportation}, where Alice has $k$ identical copies of&#10;an arbitrary unknown $d$&#45;dimensional qudit state $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to teleport&#10;a single copy of $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to Bob using a maximally entangled&#10;two&#45;qudit state shared between Alice and Bob without Bob&#39;s correction. Alice&#10;may perform a joint measurement on her half of the entangled state and the $k$&#10;copies of $vertpsi&#13;angle$. We prove that the maximal probability of success&#10;for teleporting the exact state $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to Bob is&#10;$p(d,k)=frac{k}{d(k&#45;1+d)}$ and present an explicit protocol to attain this&#10;performance. Then, by utilising $k$ copies of an arbitrary target state&#10;$vertpsi&#13;angle$, we show how the multicopy state teleportation protocol can&#10;be employed to enhance the success probability of storage and retrieval of&#10;quantum programs, which aims to universally retrieve the action of an arbitrary&#10;quantum channel that is stored in a state. Our proofs make use of group&#10;representation theory methods, which may find applications beyond the problems&#10;addressed in this work.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10393v1) |&#10;| TPFL: Tsetlin&#45;Personalized Federated Learning with Confidence&#45;Based&#10; &#160;Clustering | Rasoul Jafari Gohari, Laya Aliahmadipour, Ezat Valipour | &#160;&#160;The world of Machine Learning (ML) has witnessed rapid changes in terms of&#10;new models and ways to process users data. The majority of work that has been&#10;done is focused on Deep Learning (DL) based approaches. However, with the&#10;emergence of new algorithms such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm, there&#10;is growing interest in exploring alternative approaches that may offer unique&#10;advantages in certain domains or applications. One of these domains is&#10;Federated Learning (FL), in which users privacy is of utmost importance. Due to&#10;its novelty, FL has seen a surge in the incorporation of personalization&#10;techniques to enhance model accuracy while maintaining user privacy under&#10;personalized conditions. In this work, we propose a novel approach dubbed TPFL:&#10;Tsetlin&#45;Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into&#10;clusters based on their confidence towards a specific class. In this way,&#10;clustering can benefit from two key advantages. Firstly, clients share only&#10;what they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight&#10;aggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been&#10;enough during the training. This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are&#10;non&#45;Independent and Identically Distributed (non&#45;IID). Secondly, by sharing&#10;only weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially&#10;reduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication&#10;cost. The results of TPFL demonstrated the highest accuracy on three different&#10;datasets; namely MNIST, FashionMNIST and FEMNIST.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10392v1) |&#10;| Prompt&#45;and&#45;Transfer: Dynamic Class&#45;aware Enhancement for Few&#45;shot&#10; &#160;Segmentation | Hanbo Bi, Yingchao Feng, Wenhui Diao, Peijin Wang, Yongqiang Mao, Kun Fu, Hongqi Wang, Xian Sun | &#160;&#160;For more efficient generalization to unseen domains (classes), most Few&#45;shot&#10;Segmentation (FSS) would directly exploit pre&#45;trained encoders and only&#10;fine&#45;tune the decoder, especially in the current era of large models. However,&#10;such fixed feature encoders tend to be class&#45;agnostic, inevitably activating&#10;objects that are irrelevant to the target class. In contrast, humans can&#10;effortlessly focus on specific objects in the line of sight. This paper mimics&#10;the visual perception pattern of human beings and proposes a novel and powerful&#10;prompt&#45;driven scheme, called ``Prompt and Transfer&quot; (PAT), which constructs a&#10;dynamic class&#45;aware prompting paradigm to tune the encoder for focusing on the&#10;interested object (target class) in the current task. Three key points are&#10;elaborated to enhance the prompting: 1) Cross&#45;modal linguistic information is&#10;introduced to initialize prompts for each task. 2) Semantic Prompt Transfer&#10;(SPT) that precisely transfers the class&#45;specific semantics within the images&#10;to prompts. 3) Part Mask Generator (PMG) that works in conjunction with SPT to&#10;adaptively generate different but complementary part prompts for different&#10;individuals. Surprisingly, PAT achieves competitive performance on 4 different&#10;tasks including standard FSS, Cross&#45;domain FSS (e.g., CV, medical, and remote&#10;sensing domains), Weak&#45;label FSS, and Zero&#45;shot Segmentation, setting new&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;arts on 11 benchmarks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10389v1) |&#10;| Revising the Structure of Recurrent Neural Networks to Eliminate&#10; &#160;Numerical Derivatives in Forming Physics Informed Loss Terms with Respect to&#10; &#160;Time | Mahyar Jahani&#45;nasab, Mohamad Ali Bijarchi | &#160;&#160;Solving unsteady partial differential equations (PDEs) using recurrent neural&#10;networks (RNNs) typically requires numerical derivatives between each block of&#10;the RNN to form the physics informed loss function. However, this introduces&#10;the complexities of numerical derivatives into the training process of these&#10;models. In this study, we propose modifying the structure of the traditional&#10;RNN to enable the prediction of each block over a time interval, making it&#10;possible to calculate the derivative of the output with respect to time using&#10;the backpropagation algorithm. To achieve this, the time intervals of these&#10;blocks are overlapped, defining a mutual loss function between them.&#10;Additionally, the employment of conditional hidden states enables us to achieve&#10;a unique solution for each block. The forget factor is utilized to control the&#10;influence of the conditional hidden state on the prediction of the subsequent&#10;block. This new model, termed the Mutual Interval RNN (MI&#45;RNN), is applied to&#10;solve three different benchmarks: the Burgers equation, unsteady heat&#10;conduction in an irregular domain, and the Green vortex problem. Our results&#10;demonstrate that MI&#45;RNN can find the exact solution more accurately compared to&#10;existing RNN models. For instance, in the second problem, MI&#45;RNN achieved one&#10;order of magnitude less relative error compared to the RNN model with numerical&#10;derivatives.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10388v1) |&#10;| Sharp decay rate for eigenfunctions of perturbed periodic Schrödinger&#10; &#160;operators | Wencai Liu, Rodrigo Matos, John N. Treuer | &#160;&#160;This paper investigates uniqueness results for perturbed periodic&#10;Schr&quot;odinger operators on $mathbb{Z}^d$. Specifically, we consider operators&#10;of the form $H = &#45;Delta + V + v$, where $Delta$ is the discrete Laplacian,&#10;$V: mathbb{Z}^d &#13;ightarrow mathbb{R}$ is a periodic potential, and $v:&#10;mathbb{Z}^d &#13;ightarrow mathbb{C}$ represents a decaying impurity. We&#10;establish quantitative conditions under which the equation $&#45;Delta u + V u + v&#10;u = &#10;ambda u$, for $&#10;ambda in mathbb{C}$, admits only the trivial solution&#10;$u equiv 0$. Key applications include the absence of embedded eigenvalues for&#10;operators with impurities decaying faster than any exponential function and the&#10;determination of sharp decay rates for eigenfunctions. Our findings extend&#10;previous works by providing precise decay conditions for impurities and&#10;analyzing different spectral regimes of $&#10;ambda$.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10387v1) |&#10;| Mamba&#45;ST: State Space Model for Efficient Style Transfer | Filippo Botti, Alex Ergasti, Leonardo Rossi, Tomaso Fontanini, Claudio Ferrari, Massimo Bertozzi, Andrea Prati | &#160;&#160;The goal of style transfer is, given a content image and a style source,&#10;generating a new image preserving the content but with the artistic&#10;representation of the style source. Most of the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art architectures&#10;use transformers or diffusion&#45;based models to perform this task, despite the&#10;heavy computational burden that they require. In particular, transformers use&#10;self&#45; and cross&#45;attention layers which have large memory footprint, while&#10;diffusion models require high inference time. To overcome the above, this paper&#10;explores a novel design of Mamba, an emergent State&#45;Space Model (SSM), called&#10;Mamba&#45;ST, to perform style transfer. To do so, we adapt Mamba linear equation&#10;to simulate the behavior of cross&#45;attention layers, which are able to combine&#10;two separate embeddings into a single output, but drastically reducing memory&#10;usage and time complexity. We modified the Mamba&#39;s inner equations so to accept&#10;inputs from, and combine, two separate data streams. To the best of our&#10;knowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt the equations of SSMs to a vision&#10;task like style transfer without requiring any other module like&#10;cross&#45;attention or custom normalization layers. An extensive set of experiments&#10;demonstrates the superiority and efficiency of our method in performing style&#10;transfer compared to transformers and diffusion models.

This module employs the Z4c formulation to solve the Einstein&#10;equations. We demonstrate its accuracy through a series of standard numerical&#10;relativity tests, including convergence of the gravitational waveform from&#10;binary black hole coalescence. Furthermore, we conduct scaling tests on OLCF&#10;Frontier and NERSC Perlmutter, where AthenaK exhibits excellent weak scaling&#10;efficiency of 80% on up to 65,536 AMD MI250X GPUs on Frontier (relative to 4&#10;GPUs) and strong scaling efficiencies of 84% and 77% on AMD MI250X and NVIDIA&#10;A100 GPUs on Frontier and Perlmutter respectively. Additionally, we observe a&#10;significant performance boost, with two orders of magnitude speedup ($gtrsim&#10;200times$) on a GPU compared to a single CPU core, affirming that AthenaK is&#10;well&#45;suited for exascale computing, thereby expanding the potential for&#10;breakthroughs in numerical relativity research.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10383v1) |&#10;| J&#45;UBIK: The JAX&#45;accelerated Universal Bayesian Imaging Kit | Vincent Eberle, Matteo Guardiani, Margret Westerkamp, Philipp Frank, Julian Rüstig, Julia Stadler, Torsten A. Enßlin | &#160;&#160;Many advances in astronomy and astrophysics originate from accurate images of&#10;the sky emission across multiple wavelengths. This often requires&#10;reconstructing spatially and spectrally correlated signals detected from&#10;multiple instruments. To facilitate the high&#45;fidelity imaging of these signals,&#10;we introduce the universal Bayesian imaging kit (UBIK). Specifically, we&#10;present J&#45;UBIK, a flexible and modular implementation leveraging the&#10;JAX&#45;accelerated NIFTy.re software as its backend. J&#45;UBIK streamlines the&#10;implementation of the key Bayesian inference components, providing for all the&#10;necessary steps of Bayesian imaging pipelines. First, it provides adaptable&#10;prior models for different sky realizations. Second, it includes likelihood&#10;models tailored to specific instruments. So far, the package includes three&#10;instruments: Chandra and eROSITA for X&#45;ray observations, and the James Webb&#10;Space Telescope (JWST) for the near&#45; and mid&#45;infrared. The aim is to expand&#10;this set in the future. Third, these models can be integrated with various&#10;inference and optimization schemes, such as maximum a posteriori estimation and&#10;variational inference. Explicit demos show how to integrate the individual&#10;modules into a full analysis pipeline. Overall, J&#45;UBIK enables efficient&#10;generation of high&#45;fidelity images via Bayesian pipelines that can be tailored&#10;to specific research objectives.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10381v1) |&#10;| Thermolectricity in irradiated bilayer graphene flakes | Cynthia Ihuoma Osuala, Tanu Choudhary, Raju K. Biswas, Sudin Ganguly, Chunlei Qu, Santanu K. Maiti | &#160;&#160;We present a comprehensive study on enhancing the thermoelectric (TE)&#10;performance of bilayer graphene (BLG) through irradiation with arbitrarily&#10;polarized light, focusing on $AA$&#45; and $AB$&#45;stacked configurations with zigzag&#10;edges. Utilizing a combination of tight&#45;binding theory and density functional&#10;theory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on&#10;electronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the&#10;electronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function,&#10;which significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the&#10;overall {it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT&#10;calculations reveal that $AB$&#45;stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal&#10;conductivity compared to $AA$&#45;stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic&#10;scattering and phonon group velocity. The combined analysis shows that FOM&#10;exceeds unity in both stacking types, with notable improvements near the&#10;irradiation&#45;induced gap. Additionally, we explore the dependence of FOM on the&#10;system dimensions and temperature, demonstrating that light&#45;irradiated BLG&#10;holds great promise for efficient thermoelectric energy conversion and waste&#10;heat recovery. Our results show favorable responses over a wide range of&#10;irradiation parameters. These findings provide crucial insights into optimizing&#10;BLG for advanced TE applications through light&#45;induced modifications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10380v1) |&#10;| Leveraging Joint Spectral and Spatial Learning with MAMBA for&#10; &#160;Multichannel Speech Enhancement | Wenze Ren, Haibin Wu, Yi&#45;Cheng Lin, Xuanjun Chen, Rong Chao, Kuo&#45;Hsuan Hung, You&#45;Jin Li, Wen&#45;Yuan Ting, Hsin&#45;Min Wang, Yu Tsao | &#160;&#160;In multichannel speech enhancement, effectively capturing spatial and&#10;spectral information across different microphones is crucial for noise&#10;reduction. Traditional methods, such as CNN or LSTM, attempt to model the&#10;temporal dynamics of full&#45;band and sub&#45;band spectral and spatial features.&#10;However, these approaches face limitations in fully modeling complex temporal&#10;dependencies, especially in dynamic acoustic environments. To overcome these&#10;challenges, we modify the current advanced model McNet by introducing an&#10;improved version of Mamba, a state&#45;space model, and further propose MCMamba.&#10;MCMamba has been completely reengineered to integrate full&#45;band and narrow&#45;band&#10;spatial information with sub&#45;band and full&#45;band spectral features, providing a&#10;more comprehensive approach to modeling spatial and spectral information.

This study introduces&#10;a novel statistical approach, TAR4C, to dissect causal interactions in&#10;multichannel EEG recordings. TAR4C uses the threshold autoregressive model to&#10;describe the causal interaction between nodes or clusters of nodes in a brain&#10;network. The perspective involves testing whether one node, which may represent&#10;a brain region, can control the dynamics of the other. The node that has such&#10;an impact on the other is called a threshold variable and can be classified as&#10;a causative because its functionality is the leading source operating as an&#10;instantaneous switching mechanism that regulates the time&#45;varying&#10;autoregressive structure of the other. This statistical concept is commonly&#10;referred to as threshold non&#45;linearity. Once threshold non&#45;linearity has been&#10;verified between a pair of nodes, the subsequent essential facet of TAR&#10;modeling is to assess the predictive ability of the causal node for the current&#10;activity on the other and represent causal interactions in autoregressive&#10;terms. This predictive ability is what underlies Granger causality. The TAR4C&#10;approach can discover non&#45;linear and time&#45;dependent causal interactions without&#10;negating the G&#45;causality perspective. The efficacy of the proposed approach is&#10;exemplified by analyzing the EEG signals recorded during the motor&#10;movement/imagery experiment. The similarities and differences between the&#10;causal interactions manifesting during the execution and the imagery of a given&#10;motor movement are demonstrated by analyzing EEG recordings from multiple&#10;subjects.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10374v1) |&#10;| Instigating Cooperation among LLM Agents Using Adaptive Information&#10; &#160;Modulation | Qiliang Chen, &#160;Alireza, &#160;Ilami, Nunzio Lore, Babak Heydari | &#160;&#160;This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for&#10;human strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these&#10;agents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments. Our&#10;approach extends traditional agent&#45;based simulations by using strategic LLM&#10;agents (SLA) and introducing dynamic and adaptive governance through a&#10;pro&#45;social promoting RL agent (PPA) that modulates information access across&#10;agents in a network, optimizing social welfare and promoting pro&#45;social&#10;behavior. Through validation in iterative games, including the prisoner&#10;dilemma, we demonstrate that SLA agents exhibit nuanced strategic adaptations.&#10;The PPA agent effectively learns to adjust information transparency, resulting&#10;in enhanced cooperation rates. This framework offers significant insights into&#10;AI&#45;mediated social dynamics, contributing to the deployment of AI in real&#45;world&#10;team settings.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10372v1) |&#10;| Learning Gentle Grasping from Human&#45;Free Force Control Demonstration | Mingxuan Li, Lunwei Zhang, Tiemin Li, Yao Jiang | &#160;&#160;Humans can steadily and gently grasp unfamiliar objects based on tactile&#10;perception.

Their widespread&#10;industrial use and resistance to degradation have led to global environmental&#10;contamination and significant health concerns. While a minority of PFAS have&#10;been extensively studied, the toxicity of many PFAS remains poorly understood&#10;due to limited direct toxicological data. This study advances the predictive&#10;modeling of PFAS toxicity by combining semi&#45;supervised graph convolutional&#10;networks (GCNs) with molecular descriptors and fingerprints. We propose a novel&#10;approach to enhance the prediction of PFAS binding affinities by isolating&#10;molecular fingerprints to construct graphs where then descriptors are set as&#10;the node features. This approach specifically captures the structural,&#10;physicochemical, and topological features of PFAS without overfitting due to an&#10;abundance of features. Unsupervised clustering then identifies representative&#10;compounds for detailed binding studies. Our results provide a more accurate&#10;ability to estimate PFAS hepatotoxicity to provide guidance in chemical&#10;discovery of new PFAS and the development of new safety regulations.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10370v1) |&#10;| Stochastic Control of UAVs: An Optimal Tradeoff between Performance,&#10; &#160;Flight Smoothness and Control Effort | George Rapakoulias, Panagiotis Tsiotras | &#160;&#160;Safe and accurate control of unmanned aerial vehicles in the presence of&#10;winds is a challenging control problem due to the hard&#45;to&#45;model and highly&#10;stochastic nature of the disturbance forces acting upon the vehicle. To meet&#10;performance constraints, state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art control methods such as Incremental&#10;Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) or other adaptive control techniques require&#10;high control gains to mitigate the effects of uncertainty entering the system.&#10;While achieving good tracking performance, IDNI requires excessive control&#10;effort, results in high actuator strain, and reduced flight smoothness due to&#10;constant and aggressive corrective actions commanded by the controller. In this&#10;paper, we propose a novel control architecture that allows the user to&#10;systematically address the trade&#45;off between high authority control and&#10;performance constraint satisfaction.

Unlike physics&#45;based models, machine learning&#10;(ML)&#45;based models offer promising solutions for efficiently integrating large&#10;volumes of diverse data. We present EF4INCA, a spatiotemporal Transformer model&#10;for precipitation nowcasting that integrates satellite&#45; and ground&#45;based&#10;observations with numerical weather prediction outputs. EF4INCA provides&#10;high&#45;resolution forecasts over Austria, accurately predicting the location and&#10;shape of precipitation fields with a spatial resolution of 1 kilometre and a&#10;temporal resolution of 5 minutes, up to 90 minutes ahead. Our evaluation shows&#10;that EF4INCA outperforms conventional nowcasting models, including the&#10;operational model of Austria, particularly in scenarios with complex temporal&#10;features such as convective initiation and rapid weather changes. EF4INCA&#10;maintains higher accuracy in location forecasting but generates smoother fields&#10;at later prediction times compared to traditional models. Interpretation of our&#10;model showed that precipitation products and SEVIRI infrared channels CH7 and&#10;CH9 are the most important data streams. These results underscore the&#10;importance of combining data from different domains, including physics&#45;based&#10;model products, with ML approaches. Our study highlights the robustness of&#10;EF4INCA and its potential for improved precipitation nowcasting. We provide&#10;access to our code repository, model weights, and the dataset curated for&#10;benchmarking, facilitating further development and application.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10367v1) |&#10;&#10;">

Hill, Matthias Kluge, Martin Landriau, Ximena Mazzalay, Eva Noyola, Taniya Parikh, Jan Snigula | &#160;&#160;We analyse the stellar structure of a sample of dwarf ellipticals (dE)&#10;inhabiting various environments within the Virgo cluster. Integral&#45;field&#10;observations with a high spectral resolution allow us to robustly determine&#10;their low velocity dispersions ($sim25$ km s$^{&#45;1}$) and higher&#45;order&#10;kinematic moments out to the half&#45;light radius. We find the dEs exhibit a&#10;diversity in ages with the younger dEs being less enhanced than the older,&#10;suggesting a complex star formation history for those dEs that recently entered&#10;Virgo while others have been quenched shortly after reionization.&#10;Orbit&#45;superposition modeling allowed us to recover viewing angles, stellar&#10;mass&#45;to&#45;light ratios (with gradients), as well as the intrinsic orbit&#10;structure. We find that the angular momentum of the dEs is strongly suppressed&#10;compared to ordinary early&#45;type galaxies and correlates with the environment.&#10;Flattened dEs are so because of a suppressed kinetic energy perpendicular to&#10;their equatorial plane. Combining population and dynamical modeling results, we&#10;find an age&#45;dependent stellar initial mass function (IMF) or, alternatively,&#10;evidence for a more extended star formation history for those galaxies that&#10;have had higher initial mass and/or inhabited lower density environments. dEs&#10;appear to have a spatially homogeneous stellar structure but the state they&#10;were `frozen&#39; in as they stopped forming stars varies dramatically according to&#10;their initial conditions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10518v1) |&#10;| RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long&#45;Context LLM Inference via Vector&#10; &#160;Retrieval | Di Liu, Meng Chen, Baotong Lu, Huiqiang Jiang, Zhenhua Han, Qianxi Zhang, Qi Chen, Chengruidong Zhang, Bailu Ding, Kai Zhang, Chen Chen, Fan Yang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu | &#160;&#160;Transformer&#45;based large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly important&#10;in various domains. However, the quadratic time complexity of attention&#10;operation poses a significant challenge for scaling to longer contexts due to&#10;the extremely high inference latency and GPU memory consumption for caching&#10;key&#45;value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training&#45;free&#10;approach to accelerate attention computation. To leverage the dynamic sparse&#10;property of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor&#10;search (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most&#10;relevant ones via vector search during generation. Due to the&#10;out&#45;of&#45;distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors, off&#45;the&#45;shelf&#10;ANNS indexes still need to scan O(N) (usually 30% of all keys) data for&#10;accurate retrieval, which fails to exploit the high sparsity.&#10;RetrievalAttention first identifies the OOD challenge of ANNS&#45;based attention,&#10;and addresses it via an attention&#45;aware vector search algorithm that can adapt&#10;to queries and only access 1&#45;&#45;3% of data, thus achieving a sub&#45;linear time&#10;complexity. RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of&#10;long&#45;context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the&#10;model accuracy. Especially, RetrievalAttention only needs 16GB GPU memory for&#10;serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating&#10;one token in 0.188 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB).&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516v1) |&#10;| An Efficient Self&#45;Learning Framework For Interactive Spoken Dialog&#10; &#160;Systems | Hitesh Tulsiani, David M. Chan, Shalini Ghosh, Garima Lalwani, Prabhat Pandey, Ankish Bansal, Sri Garimella, Ariya Rastrow, Björn Hoffmeister | &#160;&#160;Dialog systems, such as voice assistants, are expected to engage with users&#10;in complex, evolving conversations. Unfortunately, traditional automatic speech&#10;recognition (ASR) systems deployed in such applications are usually trained to&#10;recognize each turn independently and lack the ability to adapt to the&#10;conversational context or incorporate user feedback. In this work, we introduce&#10;a general framework for ASR in dialog systems that can go beyond learning from&#10;single&#45;turn utterances and learn over time how to adapt to both explicit&#10;supervision and implicit user feedback present in multi&#45;turn conversations. We&#10;accomplish that by leveraging advances in student&#45;teacher learning and&#10;context&#45;aware dialog processing, and designing contrastive self&#45;supervision&#10;approaches with Ohm, a new online hard&#45;negative mining approach. We show that&#10;leveraging our new framework compared to traditional training leads to relative&#10;WER reductions of close to 10% in real&#45;world dialog systems, and up to 26% on&#10;public synthetic data.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10515v1) |&#10;| Constraints on axions from patchy screening of the cosmic microwave&#10; &#160;background | Samuel Goldstein, Fiona McCarthy, Cristina Mondino, J. Colin Hill, Junwu Huang, Matthew C. Johnson | &#160;&#160;The resonant conversion of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons into&#10;axions within large&#45;scale structure induces an anisotropic spectral distortion&#10;in CMB temperature maps. Applying state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art foreground cleaning&#10;techniques to $textit{Planck}$ CMB observations, we construct maps of&#10;axion&#45;induced &quot;patchy screening&quot; of the CMB. We cross&#45;correlate these maps with&#10;data from the $textit{unWISE}$ galaxy survey and find no evidence of axions.&#10;We constrain the axion&#45;photon coupling, $g_{agammagamma} &#10;esssim 2 times&#10;10^{&#45;12}~{&#13;m GeV}^{&#45;1}$, at the 95% confidence level for axion masses in the&#10;range $10^{&#45;13}~{&#13;m eV} &#10;esssim m_a &#10;esssim 10^{&#45;12}~{&#13;m eV}$. These&#10;constraints are competitive with the tightest astrophysical axion limits in&#10;this mass range and are inferred from robust population&#45;level statistics, which&#10;makes them complementary to existing searches that rely on modeling of&#10;individual systems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10514v1) |&#10;| Weak Superimposed Codes of Improved Asymptotic Rate and Their Randomized&#10; &#160;Construction | Yu Tsunoda, Yuichiro Fujiwara | &#160;&#160;Weak superimposed codes are combinatorial structures related closely to&#10;generalized cover&#45;free families, superimposed codes, and disjunct matrices in&#10;that they are only required to satisfy similar but less stringent conditions.&#10;This class of codes may also be seen as a stricter variant of what are known as&#10;locally thin families in combinatorics. Originally, weak superimposed codes&#10;were introduced in the context of multimedia content protection against illegal&#10;distribution of copies under the assumption that a coalition of malicious users&#10;may employ the averaging attack with adversarial noise. As in many other kinds&#10;of codes in information theory, it is of interest and importance in the study&#10;of weak superimposed codes to find the highest achievable rate in the&#10;asymptotic regime and give an efficient construction that produces an infinite&#10;sequence of codes that achieve it. Here, we prove a tighter lower bound than&#10;the sharpest known one on the rate of optimal weak superimposed codes and give&#10;a polynomial&#45;time randomized construction algorithm for codes that&#10;asymptotically attain our improved bound with high probability. Our&#10;probabilistic approach is versatile and applicable to many other related codes&#10;and arrays.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10511v1) |&#10;| Pennsieve &#45; A Collaborative Platform for Translational Neuroscience and&#10; &#160;Beyond | Zack Goldblum, Zhongchuan Xu, Haoer Shi, Patryk Orzechowski, Jamaal Spence, Kathryn A Davis, Brian Litt, Nishant Sinha, Joost Wagenaar | &#160;&#160;The exponential growth of neuroscientific data necessitates platforms that&#10;facilitate data management and multidisciplinary collaboration. In this paper,&#10;we introduce Pennsieve &#45; an open&#45;source, cloud&#45;based scientific data management&#10;platform built to meet these needs. Pennsieve supports complex multimodal&#10;datasets and provides tools for data visualization and analyses. It takes a&#10;comprehensive approach to data integration, enabling researchers to define&#10;custom metadata schemas and utilize advanced tools to filter and query their&#10;data. Pennsieve&#39;s modular architecture allows external applications to extend&#10;its capabilities, and collaborative workspaces with peer&#45;reviewed data&#10;publishing mechanisms promote high&#45;quality datasets optimized for downstream&#10;analysis, both in the cloud and on&#45;premises.&#10; &#160;Pennsieve forms the core for major neuroscience research programs including&#10;the NIH SPARC Initiative, NIH HEAL Initiative&#39;s PRECISION Human Pain Network,&#10;and NIH HEAL RE&#45;JOIN Initiative. It serves more than 80 research groups&#10;worldwide, along with several large&#45;scale, inter&#45;institutional projects at&#10;clinical sites through the University of Pennsylvania. Underpinning the&#10;SPARC.Science, Epilepsy.Science, and Pennsieve Discover portals, Pennsieve&#10;stores over 125 TB of scientific data, with 35 TB of data publicly available&#10;across more than 350 high&#45;impact datasets. It adheres to the findable,&#10;accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) principles of data sharing and&#10;is recognized as one of the NIH&#45;approved Data Repositories. By facilitating&#10;scientific data management, discovery, and analysis, Pennsieve fosters a robust&#10;and collaborative research ecosystem for neuroscience and beyond.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10509v1) |&#10;| General&#45;relativistic resistive&#45;magnetohydrodynamics simulations of&#10; &#160;self&#45;consistent magnetized rotating neutron stars | Patrick Chi&#45;Kit Cheong, Antonios Tsokaros, Milton Ruiz, Fabrizio Venturi, Juno Chun Lung Chan, Anson Ka Long Yip, Koji Uryu | &#160;&#160;We present the first general&#45;relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics&#10;simulations of self&#45;consistent, rotating neutron stars with mixed poloidal and&#10;toroidal magnetic fields. Specifically, we investigate the role of resistivity&#10;in the dynamical evolution of neutron stars over a period of up to 100 ms and&#10;its effects on their quasi&#45;equilibrium configurations. Our results demonstrate&#10;that resistivity can significantly influence the development of&#10;magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, resulting in markedly different magnetic&#10;field geometries. Additionally, resistivity suppresses the growth of these&#10;instabilities, leading to a reduction in the amplitude of emitted gravitational&#10;waves. Despite the variations in magnetic field geometries, the ratio of&#10;poloidal to toroidal field energies remains consistently 9:1 throughout the&#10;simulations, for the models we investigated.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10508v1) |&#10;| Beth&#45;Uhlenbeck equation for the thermodynamics of fluctuations in a&#10; &#160;generalised 2+1D Gross&#45;Neveu model | Biplab Mahato, David Blaschke, Dietmar Ebert | &#160;&#160;We study a generalised version of Gross&#45;Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions. The&#10;model is inspired from graphene which shows a linear dispersion relation near&#10;the Dirac points.

Here we go beyond the mean&#10;field level by deriving a Beth&#45;Uhlenbeck equation for Gaussian fluctuations,&#10;solutions of which we explore numerically, for the first time including their&#10;momentum dependence. We discuss the excitonic mass, fluctuation pressure and&#10;phase shifts. We also perform a comparison with the NJL model in 3+1 dimension&#10;and discuss its implication for graphene.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10507v1) |&#10;| Context&#45;aware Code Segmentation for C&#45;to&#45;Rust Translation using Large&#10; &#160;Language Models | Momoko Shiraishi, Takahiro Shinagawa | &#160;&#160;There is strong motivation to translate C code into Rust code due to the&#10;continuing threat of memory safety vulnerabilities in existing C programs and&#10;the significant attention paid to Rust as an alternative to the C language.&#10;While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating this translation&#10;by generating more natural and safer code than rule&#45;based methods, previous&#10;studies have shown that LLM&#45;generated Rust code often fails to compile, even&#10;for relatively small C programs, due to significant differences between the two&#10;languages and context window limitations. We propose an LLM&#45;based translation&#10;scheme that improves the success rate of translating large&#45;scale C code into&#10;compilable Rust code. Our approach involves three key techniques: (1)&#10;pre&#45;processing the C code to better align its structure and expressions with&#10;Rust, (2) segmenting the code into optimally sized translation units to avoid&#10;exceeding the LLM&#39;s context window limits, and (3) iteratively compiling and&#10;repairing errors while maintaining consistency between translation units using&#10;context&#45;supplementing prompts. Compilation success is an essential first step&#10;in achieving functional equivalence, as only compilable code can be further&#10;tested. In experiments with 20 benchmark C programs, including those exceeding&#10;4 kilo lines of code, we successfully translated all programs into compilable&#10;Rust code without losing corresponding parts of the original code.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10506v1) |&#10;| Machine Learning Optimization of non&#45;Kasha Behavior and of Transient&#10; &#160;Dynamics in Model Retinal Isomerization | Davinder Singh, Chern Chuang, Paul Brumer | &#160;&#160;Designing a model of retinal isomerization in Rhodopsin, the first step in&#10;vision, that accounts for both experimental transient and stationary state&#10;observables is challenging. Here, multi&#45;objective Bayesian optimization is&#10;employed to refine the parameters of a minimal two&#45;state&#45;two&#45;mode (TM) model&#10;describing the photoisomerization of retinal in Rhodopsin. With an appropriate&#10;selection of objectives, the optimized retinal model predicts excitation&#10;wavelength&#45;dependent fluorescence spectra that closely align with&#10;experimentally observed non&#45;Kasha behavior in the non&#45;equilibrium steady state.&#10;Further, adjustments to the potential energy surface within the TM model reduce&#10;the discrepancies across the time domain. Overall, agreement with experimental&#10;data is excellent.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10505v1) |&#10;| DILA: Dictionary Label Attention for Mechanistic Interpretability in&#10; &#160;High&#45;dimensional Multi&#45;label Medical Coding Prediction | John Wu, David Wu, Jimeng Sun | &#160;&#160;Predicting high&#45;dimensional or extreme multilabels, such as in medical&#10;coding, requires both accuracy and interpretability. Existing works often rely&#10;on local interpretability methods, failing to provide comprehensive&#10;explanations of the overall mechanism behind each label prediction within a&#10;multilabel set. We propose a mechanistic interpretability module called&#10;DIctionary Label Attention (method) that disentangles uninterpretable dense&#10;embeddings into a sparse embedding space, where each nonzero element (a&#10;dictionary feature) represents a globally learned medical concept. Through&#10;human evaluations, we show that our sparse embeddings are more human&#10;understandable than its dense counterparts by at least 50 percent. Our&#10;automated dictionary feature identification pipeline, leveraging large language&#10;models (LLMs), uncovers thousands of learned medical concepts by examining and&#10;summarizing the highest activating tokens for each dictionary feature. We&#10;represent the relationships between dictionary features and medical codes&#10;through a sparse interpretable matrix, enhancing the mechanistic and global&#10;understanding of the model&#39;s predictions while maintaining competitive&#10;performance and scalability without extensive human annotation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10504v1) |&#10;| Causal Language Modeling Can Elicit Search and Reasoning Capabilities on&#10; &#160;Logic Puzzles | Kulin Shah, Nishanth Dikkala, Xin Wang, Rina Panigrahy | &#160;&#160;Causal language modeling using the Transformer architecture has yielded&#10;remarkable capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) over the last few&#10;years. However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning&#10;capabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this&#10;work, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as&#10;solving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to&#10;search over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then&#10;apply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the&#10;application of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in&#10;a cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases,&#10;multiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We&#10;observe that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn&#10;to solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21%$ of the puzzles fully correctly)&#10;when trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that&#10;training Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and&#10;without such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis&#10;to Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves&#10;$92.04 %$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal&#10;representations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear&#10;probing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any&#10;given cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine&#10;implicit in the Transformer weights.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10502v1) |&#10;| Alignment with nonlinear velocity couplings: collision&#45;avoidance and&#10; &#160;micro&#45;to&#45;macro mean&#45;field limits | Young&#45;Pil Choi, Michał Fabisiak, Jan Peszek | &#160;&#160;We investigate the pressureless fractional Euler&#45;alignment system with&#10;nonlinear velocity couplings, referred to as the $p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system.&#10;This model features a nonlinear velocity alignment force, interpreted as a&#10;density&#45;weighted fractional $p$&#45;Laplacian when the singularity parameter&#10;$alpha$ exceeds the spatial dimension $d$. Our primary goal is to establish&#10;the existence of solutions for strongly singular interactions ($alpha ge d$)&#10;and compactly supported initial conditions. We construct solutions as&#10;mean&#45;field limits of empirical measures from a kinetic variant of the&#10;$p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system. Specifically, we show that a sequence of empirical&#10;measures converges to a finite Radon measure, whose local density and velocity&#10;satisfy the $p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system. Our results are the first to prove the&#10;existence of solutions to this system in multi&#45;dimensional settings without&#10;significant initial data restrictions, covering both nonlinear ($p&gt;2$) and&#10;linear ($p=2$) cases. Additionally, we establish global existence, uniqueness,&#10;and collision avoidance for the corresponding particle ODE system under&#10;non&#45;collisional initial conditions, extending previous results for $1 &#10;e p &#10;e&#10;alpha + 2$. This analysis supports our mean&#45;field limit argument and&#10;contributes to understanding alignment models with singular communication.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10501v1) |&#10;| Focus diverse phase retrieval test results on broadband continuous&#10; &#160;wavefront sensing in space telescope applications | Hyukmo Kang, Kyle Van Gorkom, Meghdoot Biswas, Daewook Kim, Ewan S. Douglas | &#160;&#160;Continuous wavefront sensing benefits space observatories in on&#45;orbit optical&#10;performance maintenance. To measure the phase of a wavefront, phase retrieval&#10;is an attractive technique as it uses multiple point spread function (PSF)&#10;images that are acquired by the telescope itself without extra metrology&#10;systems nor complicated calibration. The focus diverse phase retrieval utilizes&#10;PSFs from predetermined defocused positions to enhance the dynamic range of the&#10;algorithm. We describe an updated visible light active optics testbed with the&#10;addition of a linear motorized focus stage. The performance of the phase&#10;retrieval algorithm in broadband is tested under various cases. While broadband&#10;pass filters have advantages in higher signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio (SNR), the&#10;performance of phase retrieval can be restricted due to blurred image caused by&#10;diffraction and increased computing cost. We used multiple bandpass filters (10&#10;nm, 88 nm, and 150 nm) and investigated effects of bandwidth on the accuracy&#10;and required image acquisition conditions such as SNR, reaching accuracies&#10;below 20 nm RMS wavefront error at the widest bandwidth. We also investigated&#10;the dynamic range of the phase retrieval algorithm depending on the bandwidth&#10;and required amount of defocus to expand dynamic range. Finally, we simulated&#10;the continuous wavefront sensing and correction loop with a range of&#10;statistically generated representative telescope disturbance time series to&#10;test for edge cases.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10500v1) |&#10;| The role of higher&#45;order terms in trapped&#45;ion quantum computing with&#10; &#160;magnetic gradient induced coupling | Sebastian Nagies, Kevin T. Geier, Javed Akram, Junichi Okamoto, Dimitris Badounas, Christof Wunderlich, Michael Johanning, Philipp Hauke | &#160;&#160;Trapped&#45;ion hardware based on the Magnetic Gradient Induced Coupling (MAGIC)&#10;scheme is emerging as a promising platform for quantum computing. Nevertheless,&#10;in this (as in any other) quantum&#45;computing platform, many technical questions&#10;still have to be resolved before large&#45;scale and error&#45;tolerant applications&#10;are possible. In this work, we present a thorough discussion of the&#10;contribution of higher&#45;order terms to the MAGIC setup, which can occur due to&#10;anharmonicities in the external potential of the ion crystal (e.g., through&#10;Coulomb repulsion) or through curvature of the applied magnetic field. These&#10;terms take the form of three&#45;spin couplings as well as diverse terms that&#10;couple spins to phonons. We find that most of these are negligible in realistic&#10;situations, with only two contributions that need careful attention. First,&#10;there are parasitic longitudinal fields whose strength increases with chain&#10;length, but which can easily be compensated by a microwave detuning. Second,&#10;anharmonicities of the Coulomb interaction can lead to well&#45;known two&#45;to&#45;one&#10;conversions of phonon excitations, which can be avoided if the phonons are&#10;ground&#45;state cooled. Our detailed analysis constitutes an important&#10;contribution on the way of making magnetic&#45;gradient trapped&#45;ion quantum&#10;technology fit for large&#45;scale applications, and it may inspire new ways to&#10;purposefully design interaction terms.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10498v1) |&#10;| MusicLIME: Explainable Multimodal Music Understanding | Theodoros Sotirou, Vassilis Lyberatos, Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Stamou | &#160;&#160;Multimodal models are critical for music understanding tasks, as they capture&#10;the complex interplay between audio and lyrics. However, as these models become&#10;more prevalent, the need for explainability grows&#45;understanding how these&#10;systems make decisions is vital for ensuring fairness, reducing bias, and&#10;fostering trust. In this paper, we introduce MusicLIME, a model&#45;agnostic&#10;feature importance explanation method designed for multimodal music models.&#10;Unlike traditional unimodal methods, which analyze each modality separately&#10;without considering the interaction between them, often leading to incomplete&#10;or misleading explanations, MusicLIME reveals how audio and lyrical features&#10;interact and contribute to predictions, providing a holistic view of the&#10;model&#39;s decision&#45;making. Additionally, we enhance local explanations by&#10;aggregating them into global explanations, giving users a broader perspective&#10;of model behavior. Through this work, we contribute to improving the&#10;interpretability of multimodal music models, empowering users to make informed&#10;choices, and fostering more equitable, fair, and transparent music&#10;understanding systems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10496v1) |&#10;| Incorporating Classifier&#45;Free Guidance in Diffusion Model&#45;Based&#10; &#160;Recommendation | Noah Buchanan, Susan Gauch, Quan Mai | &#160;&#160;This paper presents a diffusion&#45;based recommender system that incorporates&#10;classifier&#45;free guidance. Most current recommender systems provide&#10;recommendations using conventional methods such as collaborative or&#10;content&#45;based filtering. Diffusion is a new approach to generative AI that&#10;improves on previous generative AI approaches such as Variational Autoencoders&#10;(VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We incorporate diffusion in&#10;a recommender system that mirrors the sequence users take when browsing and&#10;rating items. Although a few current recommender systems incorporate diffusion,&#10;they do not incorporate classifier&#45;free guidance, a new innovation in diffusion&#10;models as a whole. In this paper, we present a diffusion recommender system&#10;that augments the underlying recommender system model for improved performance&#10;and also incorporates classifier&#45;free guidance. Our findings show improvements&#10;over state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art recommender systems for most metrics for several&#10;recommendation tasks on a variety of datasets. In particular, our approach&#10;demonstrates the potential to provide better recommendations when data is&#10;sparse.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10494v1) |&#10;| Renormalization of the Einstein&#45;Cartan Theory in First&#45;Order Form | F.

We study the&#10;renormalizability of this theory in the framework of the Batalin&#45;Vilkovisky&#10;formalism, which allows for a gauge invariant renormalization. Using the&#10;background field method, we discuss the gauge invariance of the background&#10;effective action and analyze the Ward identities which reflect the symmetries&#10;of the EC theory. As an application, we compute, in a general background gauge,&#10;the self&#45;energy of the tetrad field at one&#45;loop order.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10493v1) |&#10;| What we can learn from the angular differential rates (only) in&#10; &#160;semileptonic $B to D^* ell ν_ell$ decays | G.

Our approach is model independent and never requires the&#10;knowledge of $vert V_{cb}vert$. By studying such distributions in the case of&#10;light leptons, a comparison between results from different data sets from the&#10;Belle and BelleII Collaborations and between data and Standard Model&#10;calculations is also given for several interesting quantities.

Eisty | &#160;&#160;The growing trend of vulnerability issues in software development as a result&#10;of a large dependence on open&#45;source projects has received considerable&#10;attention recently. This paper investigates the effectiveness of Large Language&#10;Models (LLMs) in identifying vulnerabilities within codebases, with a focus on&#10;the latest advancements in LLM technology. Through a comparative analysis, we&#10;assess the performance of emerging LLMs, specifically Llama, CodeLlama, Gemma,&#10;and CodeGemma, alongside established state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art models such as BERT,&#10;RoBERTa, and GPT&#45;3. Our study aims to shed light on the capabilities of LLMs in&#10;vulnerability detection, contributing to the enhancement of software security&#10;practices across diverse open&#45;source repositories. We observe that CodeGemma&#10;achieves the highest F1&#45;score of 58 and a Recall of 87, amongst the recent&#10;additions of large language models to detect software security vulnerabilities.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10490v1) |&#10;| Flash STU: Fast Spectral Transform Units | Y.

Our paper aims to investigate if VLMs&#10;pre&#45;trained on web&#45;scale data learn to encode object states, which can be&#10;extracted with zero&#45;shot text prompts. We curate an object state recognition&#10;dataset ChangeIt&#45;Frames, and evaluate nine open&#45;source VLMs, including models&#10;trained with contrastive and generative objectives. We observe that while these&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art vision&#45;language models can reliably perform object&#10;recognition, they consistently fail to accurately distinguish the objects&#39;&#10;physical states. Through extensive experiments, we identify three areas for&#10;improvements for VLMs to better encode object states, namely the quality of&#10;object localization, the architecture to bind concepts to objects, and the&#10;objective to learn discriminative visual and language encoders on object&#10;states.

Ruan, Michael Eracleous, Daryl Haggard, Jessie C. Runnoe | &#160;&#160;The physical processes that produce X&#45;ray Quasi&#45;Periodic Eruptions (QPEs)&#10;recently discovered from the nuclei of several low&#45;redshift galaxies are&#10;mysterious. Several pieces of observational evidence strongly suggest a link&#10;between QPEs and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE). Previous studies also reveal&#10;that the morphologies of TDE host galaxies are highly concentrated, with high&#10;Sersic indicies, bulge&#45;to&#45;total light (B/T) ratios, and stellar surface mass&#10;densities relative to the broader galaxy population. We use these distinctive&#10;properties to test the link between QPEs and TDEs, by comparing these&#10;parameters of QPE host galaxies to TDE host galaxies. We employ archival Legacy&#10;Survey images of a sample of 9 QPE host galaxies and a sample of 13 TDE host&#10;galaxies, and model their surface brightness profiles. We show that QPE host&#10;galaxies have high Sersic indices of ~3, high B/T ratios of ~0.5, and high&#10;surface mass densities of ~10^10 Msun kpc^&#45;2. These properties are similar to&#10;TDE host galaxies, but are in strong contrast to a mass&#45; and redshift&#45;matched&#10;control sample of galaxies. We also find tentative evidence that the central&#10;black holes in both QPE and TDE host galaxies are undermassive relative to&#10;their stellar mass. The morphological similarities between QPE and TDE host&#10;galaxies at the population level add to the mounting evidence of a physical&#10;link between these phenomena, and favor QPE models that also invoke TDEs.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10486v1) |&#10;| Tuning the Rate of Tightly Packed Systems To Produce Planet Occurrence&#10; &#160;Trends with Galactic Height | Sarah Ballard | &#160;&#160;The formation of planetary systems has historically been considered in&#10;isolation, decoupled from processes on galactic scales. Recent findings&#10;employing data from ESA&#39;s Gaia mission challenge this narrative, identifying&#10;trends in planet occurrence with galactic kinematics and stellar age. The&#10;findings indicate changes in planet occurrence over and above the predicted&#10;changes from metallicity variation within the Milky Way, so that changes to&#10;stellar metallicity alone (long understood to be deterministic in planet&#10;outcomes) cannot explain the trends entirely. The scope of potential factors&#10;influencing planet formation has grown progressively wider, with accompanying&#10;theoretical support for galactic&#45;scale influences upon planet formation. In&#10;this manuscript, we investigate specifically how changes to the rate of Systems&#10;of Tightly&#45;packed Inner Planets (STIPs) could manifest as a trend in planet&#10;occurrence with galactic height. We focus our study upon M dwarf planetary&#10;systems for two reasons: first, they host STIPs at high rates, and secondly,&#10;their longevity makes them useful probes for kinematic trends over Gyr. We&#10;consider two models for a varying STIP rate: one in which STIP likelihood is&#10;determined by stellar age alone, irrespective of galactic time, and another in&#10;which the STIP likelihood suddenly increased in recent galactic history. Both&#10;models, which impose a higher STIP likelihood among younger stars, produce a&#10;negative gradient in planet occurrence with increasing height from the galactic&#10;midplane. We find that a step function model in which STIP likelihood increased&#10;by a factor of several ~a few Gyr ago resembles an observed trend among FGK&#10;dwarfs. We consider plausible physical mechanisms that could mimic the&#10;hypothesized model, given known links between STIP occurrence and other stellar&#10;and planetary properties.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10485v1) |&#10;| XLM for Autonomous Driving Systems: A Comprehensive Review | Sonda Fourati, Wael Jaafar, Noura Baccar, Safwan Alfattani | &#160;&#160;Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable proficiency in various&#10;information&#45;processing tasks. These tasks span from extracting data and&#10;summarizing literature to generating content, predictive modeling,&#10;decision&#45;making, and system controls. Moreover, Vision Large Models (VLMs) and&#10;Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which represent the next generation of language&#10;models, a.k.a., XLMs, can combine and integrate many data modalities with the&#10;strength of language understanding, thus advancing several information&#45;based&#10;systems, such as Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). Indeed, by combining&#10;language communication with multimodal sensory inputs, e.g., panoramic images&#10;and LiDAR or radar data, accurate driving actions can be taken. In this&#10;context, we provide in this survey paper a comprehensive overview of the&#10;potential of XLMs towards achieving autonomous driving. Specifically, we review&#10;the relevant literature on ADS and XLMs, including their architectures, tools,&#10;and frameworks. Then, we detail the proposed approaches to deploy XLMs for&#10;autonomous driving solutions. Finally, we provide the related challenges to XLM&#10;deployment for ADS and point to future research directions aiming to enable XLM&#10;adoption in future ADS frameworks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10484v1) |&#10;| Efficient polarizable QM/MM using the direct reaction field Hamiltonian&#10; &#160;with electrostatic potential fitted multipole operators | Thomas P. Fay, Nicolas Ferré, Miquel Huix&#45;Rotllant | &#160;&#160;Electronic polarization and dispersion are decisive actors in determining&#10;interaction energies between molecules. These interactions have a particularly&#10;profound effect on excitation energies of molecules in complex environments,&#10;especially when the excitation involves a significant degree of charge&#10;reorganisation. The direct reaction field (DRF) approach, which has seen a&#10;recent revival of interest, provides a powerful framework for describing these&#10;interactions in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models of&#10;systems, where a small subsystem of interest is described using quantum&#10;chemical methods and the remainder is treated with a simple MM force field. In&#10;this paper we show how the DRF approach can be combined with the electrostatic&#10;potential fitted (ESPF) multipole operator description of the QM region charge&#10;density, which reduces the scaling $mathcal{O}(N_mathrm{MM}^3)$ of the method&#10;with MM system to $mathcal{O}(N_mathrm{MM}^2)$. We also show how the DRF&#10;approach can be combined with fluctuating charge descriptions of the&#10;polarizable environment, as well as previously used atom&#45;centred&#10;dipole&#45;polarizability based models. We further show that the ESPF&#45;DRF method&#10;provides an accurate description of molecular interactions in both ground and&#10;excited electronic states of the QM system and apply it to predict the gas to&#10;aqueous solution solvatochromic shifts in the UV/visible absorption spectrum of&#10;acrolein.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10483v1) |&#10;| Schrodinger&#39;s Memory: Large Language Models | Wei Wang, Qing Li | &#160;&#160;Memory is the foundation of LLMs&#39; functionality, yet past research has lacked&#10;an in&#45;depth exploration of their memory capabilities and underlying theory.

These assumptions limit their use&#10;when acquisition conditions, such as the subject&#39;s distance from the camera or&#10;the camera&#39;s characteristics, are different than expected, as typically happens&#10;in video surveillance. Additionally, 3DFR algorithms follow various strategies&#10;to address the reconstruction of a 3D shape from 2D data, such as statistical&#10;model fitting, photometric stereo, or deep learning. In the present study, we&#10;explore the application of three 3DFR algorithms representative of the SOTA,&#10;employing each one as the template set generator for a face verification&#10;system. The scores provided by each system are combined by score&#45;level fusion.&#10;We show that the complementarity induced by different 3DFR algorithms improves&#10;performance when tests are conducted at never&#45;seen&#45;before distances from the&#10;camera and camera characteristics (cross&#45;distance and cross&#45;camera settings),&#10;thus encouraging further investigations on multiple 3DFR&#45;based approaches.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10481v1) |&#10;| Addressing misspecification in contextual optimization | Omar Bennouna, Jiawei Zhang, Saurabh Amin, Asuman Ozdaglar | &#160;&#160;We study a linear contextual optimization problem where a decision maker has&#10;access to historical data and contextual features to learn a cost prediction&#10;model aimed at minimizing decision error. We adopt the predict&#45;then&#45;optimize&#10;framework for this analysis. Given that perfect model alignment with reality is&#10;often unrealistic in practice, we focus on scenarios where the chosen&#10;hypothesis set is misspecified. In this context, it remains unclear whether&#10;current contextual optimization approaches can effectively address such model&#10;misspecification. In this paper, we present a novel integrated learning and&#10;optimization approach designed to tackle model misspecification in contextual&#10;optimization. This approach offers theoretical generalizability, tractability,&#10;and optimality guarantees, along with strong practical performance. Our method&#10;involves minimizing a tractable surrogate loss that aligns with the performance&#10;value from cost vector predictions, regardless of whether the model&#10;misspecified or not, and can be optimized in reasonable time. To our knowledge,&#10;no previous work has provided an approach with such guarantees in the context&#10;of model misspecification.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10479v1) |&#10;| Local SGD for Near&#45;Quadratic Problems: Improving Convergence under&#10; &#160;Unconstrained Noise Conditions | Andrey Sadchikov, Savelii Chezhegov, Aleksandr Beznosikov, Alexander Gasnikov | &#160;&#160;Distributed optimization plays an important role in modern large&#45;scale&#10;machine learning and data processing systems by optimizing the utilization of&#10;computational resources. One of the classical and popular approaches is Local&#10;Stochastic Gradient Descent (Local SGD), characterized by multiple local&#10;updates before averaging, which is particularly useful in distributed&#10;environments to reduce communication bottlenecks and improve scalability. A&#10;typical feature of this method is the dependence on the frequency of&#10;communications. But in the case of a quadratic target function with homogeneous&#10;data distribution over all devices, the influence of frequency of&#10;communications vanishes. As a natural consequence, subsequent studies include&#10;the assumption of a Lipschitz Hessian, as this indicates the similarity of the&#10;optimized function to a quadratic one to some extent. However, in order to&#10;extend the completeness of the Local SGD theory and unlock its potential, in&#10;this paper we abandon the Lipschitz Hessian assumption by introducing a new&#10;concept of $textit{approximate quadraticity}$. This assumption gives a new&#10;perspective on problems that have near quadratic properties. In addition,&#10;existing theoretical analyses of Local SGD often assume bounded variance. We,&#10;in turn, consider the unbounded noise condition, which allows us to broaden the&#10;class of studied problems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10478v1) |&#10;| SimInversion: A Simple Framework for Inversion&#45;Based Text&#45;to&#45;Image&#10; &#160;Editing | Qi Qian, Haiyang Xu, Ming Yan, Juhua Hu | &#160;&#160;Diffusion models demonstrate impressive image generation performance with&#10;text guidance. Inspired by the learning process of diffusion, existing images&#10;can be edited according to text by DDIM inversion. However, the vanilla DDIM&#10;inversion is not optimized for classifier&#45;free guidance and the accumulated&#10;error will result in the undesired performance. While many algorithms are&#10;developed to improve the framework of DDIM inversion for editing, in this work,&#10;we investigate the approximation error in DDIM inversion and propose to&#10;disentangle the guidance scale for the source and target branches to reduce the&#10;error while keeping the original framework. Moreover, a better guidance scale&#10;(i.e., 0.5) than default settings can be derived theoretically. Experiments on&#10;PIE&#45;Bench show that our proposal can improve the performance of DDIM inversion&#10;dramatically without sacrificing efficiency.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10476v1) |&#10;| Leadership and Engagement Dynamics in Legislative Twitter Networks:&#10; &#160;Statistical Analysis and Modeling | Carolina Luque, Juan Sosa | &#160;&#160;In this manuscript, we analyze the interaction network on Twitter among&#10;members of the 117th U.S. Congress to assess the visibility of political&#10;leaders and explore how systemic properties and node attributes influence the&#10;formation of legislative connections. We employ descriptive social network&#10;statistical methods, the exponential random graph model (ERGM), and the&#10;stochastic block model (SBM) to evaluate the relative impact of network&#10;systemic properties, as well as institutional and personal traits, on the&#10;generation of online relationships among legislators. Our findings reveal that&#10;legislative networks on social media platforms like Twitter tend to reinforce&#10;the leadership of dominant political actors rather than diminishing their&#10;influence. However, we identify that these leadership roles can manifest in&#10;various forms. Additionally, we highlight that online connections within&#10;legislative networks are influenced by both the systemic properties of the&#10;network and institutional characteristics.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10475v1) |&#10;| MacDiff: Unified Skeleton Modeling with Masked Conditional Diffusion | Lehong Wu, Lilang Lin, Jiahang Zhang, Yiyang Ma, Jiaying Liu | &#160;&#160;Self&#45;supervised learning has proved effective for skeleton&#45;based human action&#10;understanding. However, previous works either rely on contrastive learning that&#10;suffers false negative problems or are based on reconstruction that learns too&#10;much unessential low&#45;level clues, leading to limited representations for&#10;downstream tasks. Recently, great advances have been made in generative&#10;learning, which is naturally a challenging yet meaningful pretext task to model&#10;the general underlying data distributions. However, the representation learning&#10;capacity of generative models is under&#45;explored, especially for the skeletons&#10;with spacial sparsity and temporal redundancy. To this end, we propose Masked&#10;Conditional Diffusion (MacDiff) as a unified framework for human skeleton&#10;modeling. For the first time, we leverage diffusion models as effective&#10;skeleton representation learners. Specifically, we train a diffusion decoder&#10;conditioned on the representations extracted by a semantic encoder. Random&#10;masking is applied to encoder inputs to introduce a information bottleneck and&#10;remove redundancy of skeletons. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that&#10;our generative objective involves the contrastive learning objective which&#10;aligns the masked and noisy views. Meanwhile, it also enforces the&#10;representation to complement for the noisy view, leading to better&#10;generalization performance. MacDiff achieves state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art performance on&#10;representation learning benchmarks while maintaining the competence for&#10;generative tasks. Moreover, we leverage the diffusion model for data&#10;augmentation, significantly enhancing the fine&#45;tuning performance in scenarios&#10;with scarce labeled data.

Hassan | &#160;&#160;The proliferation of open Pre&#45;trained Language Models (PTLMs) on model&#10;registry platforms like Hugging Face (HF) presents both opportunities and&#10;challenges for companies building products around them. Similar to traditional&#10;software dependencies, PTLMs continue to evolve after a release. However, the&#10;current state of release practices of PTLMs on model registry platforms are&#10;plagued by a variety of inconsistencies, such as ambiguous naming conventions&#10;and inaccessible model training documentation. Given the knowledge gap on&#10;current PTLM release practices, our empirical study uses a mixed&#45;methods&#10;approach to analyze the releases of 52,227 PTLMs on the most well&#45;known model&#10;registry, HF. Our results reveal 148 different naming practices for PTLM&#10;releases, with 40.87% of changes to model weight files not represented in the&#10;adopted name&#45;based versioning practice or their documentation. In addition, we&#10;identified that the 52,227 PTLMs are derived from only 299 different base&#10;models (the modified original models used to create 52,227 PTLMs), with&#10;Fine&#45;tuning and Quantization being the most prevalent modification methods&#10;applied to these base models. Significant gaps in release transparency, in&#10;terms of training dataset specifications and model card availability, still&#10;exist, highlighting the need for standardized documentation. While we&#10;identified a model naming practice explicitly differentiating between major and&#10;minor PTLM releases, we did not find any significant difference in the types of&#10;changes that went into either type of releases, suggesting that major/minor&#10;version numbers for PTLMs often are chosen arbitrarily. Our findings provide&#10;valuable insights to improve PTLM release practices, nudging the field towards&#10;more formal semantic versioning practices.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10472v1) |&#10;| Real&#45;Time Whole&#45;Body Control of Legged Robots with Model&#45;Predictive Path&#10; &#160;Integral Control | Juan Alvarez&#45;Padilla, John Z. Zhang, Sofia Kwok, John M. Dolan, Zachary Manchester | &#160;&#160;This paper presents a system for enabling real&#45;time synthesis of whole&#45;body&#10;locomotion and manipulation policies for real&#45;world legged robots. Motivated by&#10;recent advancements in robot simulation, we leverage the efficient&#10;parallelization capabilities of the MuJoCo simulator to achieve fast sampling&#10;over the robot state and action trajectories. Our results show surprisingly&#10;effective real&#45;world locomotion and manipulation capabilities with a very&#10;simple control strategy. We demonstrate our approach on several hardware and&#10;simulation experiments: robust locomotion over flat and uneven terrains,&#10;climbing over a box whose height is comparable to the robot, and pushing a box&#10;to a goal position. To our knowledge, this is the first successful deployment&#10;of whole&#45;body sampling&#45;based MPC on real&#45;world legged robot hardware.&#10;Experiment videos and code can be found at: https://whole&#45;body&#45;mppi.github.io/&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10469v1) |&#10;| Assortativity in sympatric speciation and species classification | Joao U. F. Lizarraga, Flavia M. D. Marquitti, Marcus A. M. de Aguiar | &#160;&#160;We investigate the role of assortative mating in speciation using the&#10;sympatric model of Derrida and Higgs. The model explores the idea that genetic&#10;differences create incompatibilities between individuals, preventing mating if&#10;the number of such differences is too large. Speciation, however, only happens&#10;in this mating system if the number of genes is large. Here we show that&#10;speciation with small genome sizes can occur if assortative mating is&#10;introduced. In our model individuals are represented by three chromosomes: one&#10;responsible for reproductive compatibility, one for coding the trait on which&#10;assortativity will operate, and a neutral chromosome. Reproduction is possible&#10;if individuals are genetically similar with respect to the first chromosome,&#10;but among these compatible mating partners, the one with the most similar trait&#10;coded by the second chromosome is selected. We show that this type of&#10;assortativity facilitates speciation, which can happen with a small number of&#10;genes in the first chromosome. Species, classified according to reproductive&#10;isolation, dictated by the first chromosome, can display different traits&#10;values, as measured by the second and the third chromosomes. Therefore, species&#10;can also be identified based on similarity of the neutral trait, which works as&#10;a proxy for reproductive isolation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10466v1) |&#10;| A stabilized total pressure&#45;formulation of the Biot&#39;s poroelasticity&#10; &#160;equations in frequency domain: numerical analysis and applications | Cristian Cárcamo, Alfonso Caiazzo, Felipe Galarce, Joaquín Mura | &#160;&#160;This work focuses on the numerical solution of the dynamics of a poroelastic&#10;material in the frequency domain. We provide a detailed stability analysis&#10;based on the application of the Fredholm alternative in the continuous case,&#10;considering a total pressure formulation of the Biot&#39;s equations. In the&#10;discrete setting, we propose a stabilized equal order finite element method&#10;complemented by an additional pressure stabilization to enhance the robustness&#10;of the numerical scheme with respect to the fluid permeability. Utilizing the&#10;Fredholm alternative, we extend the well&#45;posedness results to the discrete&#10;setting, obtaining theoretical optimal convergence for the case of linear&#10;finite elements. We present different numerical experiments to validate the&#10;proposed method. First, we consider model problems with known analytic&#10;solutions in two and three dimensions. As next, we show that the method is&#10;robust for a wide range of permeabilities, including the case of discontinuous&#10;coefficients. Lastly, we show the application for the simulation of brain&#10;elastography on a realistic brain geometry obtained from medical imaging.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10465v1) |&#10;| New Direct Sum Tests | Alek Westover, Edward Yu, Kai Zheng | &#160;&#160;A function $f:[n]^{d} to mathbb{F}_2$ is a defn{direct sum} if there are&#10;functions $L_i:[n]to mathbb{F}_2$ such that ${f(x) = sum_{i}L_i(x_i)}$. In&#10;this work we give multiple results related to the property testing of direct&#10;sums.&#10; &#160;Our first result concerns a test proposed by Dinur and Golubev in 2019. We&#10;call their test the Diamond test and show that it is indeed a direct sum&#10;tester. More specifically, we show that if a function $f$ is $epsilon$&#45;far&#10;from being a direct sum function, then the Diamond test rejects $f$ with&#10;probability at least $Omega_{n,epsilon}(1)$. Even in the case of $n = 2$, the&#10;Diamond test is, to the best of our knowledge, novel and yields a new tester&#10;for the classic property of affinity.&#10; &#160;Apart from the Diamond test, we also analyze a broad family of direct sum&#10;tests, which at a high level, run an arbitrary affinity test on the restriction&#10;of $f$ to a random hypercube inside of $[n]^d$. This family of tests includes&#10;the direct sum test analyzed in cite{di19}, but does not include the Diamond&#10;test. As an application of our result, we obtain a direct sum test which works&#10;in the online adversary model of cite{KRV}.&#10; &#160;Finally, we also discuss a Fourier analytic interpretation of the diamond&#10;tester in the $n=2$ case, as well as prove local correction results for direct&#10;sum as conjectured by Dinur and Golubev.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10464v1) |&#10;| Kolmogorov&#45;Arnold Networks in Low&#45;Data Regimes: A Comparative Study with&#10; &#160;Multilayer Perceptrons | Farhad Pourkamali&#45;Anaraki | &#160;&#160;Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) have long been a cornerstone in deep learning,&#10;known for their capacity to model complex relationships. Recently,&#10;Kolmogorov&#45;Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a compelling alternative,&#10;utilizing highly flexible learnable activation functions directly on network&#10;edges, a departure from the neuron&#45;centric approach of MLPs. However, KANs&#10;significantly increase the number of learnable parameters, raising concerns&#10;about their effectiveness in data&#45;scarce environments. This paper presents a&#10;comprehensive comparative study of MLPs and KANs from both algorithmic and&#10;experimental perspectives, with a focus on low&#45;data regimes. We introduce an&#10;effective technique for designing MLPs with unique, parameterized activation&#10;functions for each neuron, enabling a more balanced comparison with KANs. Using&#10;empirical evaluations on simulated data and two real&#45;world data sets from&#10;medicine and engineering, we explore the trade&#45;offs between model complexity&#10;and accuracy, with particular attention to the role of network depth. Our&#10;findings show that MLPs with individualized activation functions achieve&#10;significantly higher predictive accuracy with only a modest increase in&#10;parameters, especially when the sample size is limited to around one hundred.&#10;For example, in a three&#45;class classification problem within additive&#10;manufacturing, MLPs achieve a median accuracy of 0.91, significantly&#10;outperforming KANs, which only reach a median accuracy of 0.53 with default&#10;hyperparameters. These results offer valuable insights into the impact of&#10;activation function selection in neural networks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10463v1) |&#10;| Effects of synapse location, delay and background stochastic activity on&#10; &#160;synchronising hippocampal CA1 neurons | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore | &#160;&#160;We study the synchronisation of neurons in a realistic model under the&#10;Hodgkin&#45;Huxley dynamics. To focus on the role of the different locations of the&#10;excitatory synapses, we use two identical neurons where the set of input&#10;signals is grouped at two different distances from the soma. The system is&#10;intended to represent a CA1 hippocampal neuron in which the synapses arriving&#10;from the CA3 neurons of the trisynaptic pathway appear to be localised in the&#10;apical dendritic region and are, in principle, either proximal or distal to the&#10;soma. Synchronisation is studied using a specifically defined spiking&#10;correlation function as a function of various parameters such as the distance&#10;from the soma of one of the synaptic groups, the inhibition weight and the&#10;associated activation delay. We found that the neurons&#39; spiking activity&#10;depends nonmonotonically on the relative dendritic location of the synapses and&#10;their inhibitory weight, whereas the synchronisation measure always decreases&#10;with inhibition, and strongly depends on its activation time delay. The&#10;background activity on the somas results essentially independent on the&#10;fluctuation intensity and strongly support the importance of the balance&#10;between inhibition and excitation for neuronal synchronization.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10460v1) |&#10;| Efficiently Crowdsourcing Visual Importance with Punch&#45;Hole Annotation | Minsuk Chang, Soohyun Lee, Aeri Cho, Hyeon Jeon, Seokhyeon Park, Cindy Xiong Bearfield, Jinwook Seo | &#160;&#160;We introduce a novel crowdsourcing method for identifying important areas in&#10;graphical images through punch&#45;hole labeling. Traditional methods, such as gaze&#10;trackers and mouse&#45;based annotations, which generate continuous data, can be&#10;impractical in crowdsourcing scenarios. They require many participants, and the&#10;outcome data can be noisy. In contrast, our method first segments the graphical&#10;image with a grid and drops a portion of the patches (punch holes). Then, we&#10;iteratively ask the labeler to validate each annotation with holes, narrowing&#10;down the annotation only having the most important area. This approach aims to&#10;reduce annotation noise in crowdsourcing by standardizing the annotations while&#10;enhancing labeling efficiency and reliability. Preliminary findings from&#10;fundamental charts demonstrate that punch&#45;hole labeling can effectively&#10;pinpoint critical regions. This also highlights its potential for broader&#10;application in visualization research, particularly in studying large&#45;scale&#10;users&#39; graphical perception. Our future work aims to enhance the algorithm to&#10;achieve faster labeling speed and prove its utility through large&#45;scale&#10;experiments.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10459v1) |&#10;| Full distribution of local observables in an exactly solvable current&#10; &#160;carrying steady states of a driven XXZ chain | Sandipan Manna, G J Sreejith | &#160;&#160;Current carrying steady states of interacting spins chains exhibit rich&#10;structures generated through an interplay of current induced correlations and&#10;energetic constraints from the Hamiltonian. The XXZ spin chain when coupled to&#10;maximally polarizing Lindblad terms admits an exact solution in a matrix&#10;product state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations&#10;and distributions of simple local spin observables in the non equilibrium&#10;steady state (NESS). We present exact expressions for spin correlators, entropy&#10;per site, cumulant generating functions for distributions of local observables&#10;in the XX limit (Ising anisotropy $Delta=0$). Further, we use the exact MPS&#10;solution in systems with $Delta&gt;0$, to numerically exactly calculate the&#10;entropy, correlations, as well as distributions of spin observables in blocks&#10;as large as $nsim 200$ sites allowing an estimation of the rate functions. The&#10;$z$ magnetization distribution is consistant with short range spin correlations&#10;in the $z$ direction while the $x$&#45;magnetization shows a double peak structure&#10;at larger $Delta$ suggesting short range ferromagnetic ordering. We find that&#10;the distribution of $z$&#45;magnetization sharpens for parameters where the current&#10;is maximized.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10458v1) |&#10;| Mean Residual Life Ageing Intensity Function | Ashutosh Singh, Ishapathik Das, Asok Kumar Nanda, Sumen Sen | &#160;&#160;The ageing intensity function is a powerful analytical tool that provides&#10;valuable insights into the ageing process across diverse domains such as&#10;reliability engineering, actuarial science, and healthcare. Its applications&#10;continue to expand as researchers delve deeper into understanding the complex&#10;dynamics of ageing and its implications for society. One common approach to&#10;defining the ageing intensity function is through the hazard rate or failure&#10;rate function, extensively explored in scholarly literature. Equally&#10;significant to the hazard rate function is the mean residual life function,&#10;which plays a crucial role in analyzing the ageing patterns exhibited by units&#10;or components. This article introduces the mean residual life ageing intensity&#10;(MRLAI) function to delve into component ageing behaviours across various&#10;distributions. Additionally, we scrutinize the closure properties of the MRLAI&#10;function across different reliability operations. Furthermore, a new order&#10;termed the mean residual life ageing intensity order is defined to analyze the&#10;ageing behaviour of a system, and the closure property of this order under&#10;various reliability operations is discussed.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10456v1) |&#10;| Quantile Fourier regressions for decision making under uncertainty | Arash Khojaste, Geoffrey Pritchard, Golbon Zakeri | &#160;&#160;Weconsider Markov decision processes arising from a Markov model of an&#10;underlying natural phenomenon. Such phenomena are usually periodic (e.g.&#10;annual) in time, and so the Markov processes modelling them must be&#10;time&#45;inhomogeneous, with cyclostationary rather than stationary behaviour. We&#10;describe a technique for constructing such processes that allows for periodic&#10;variations both in the values taken by the process and in the serial dependence&#10;structure. We include two illustrative numerical examples: a hydropower&#10;scheduling problem and a model of offshore wind power integration.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10455v1) |&#10;| The Debiased Near&#45;Earth Object Population from ATLAS Telescopes | Rogerio Deienno, Larry Denneau, David Nesvorný, David Vokrouhlický, William F. Bottke, Robert Jedicke, Shantanu Naidu, Steven R. Chesley, Davide Farnocchia, Paul W. Chodas | &#160;&#160;This work is dedicated to debias the Near&#45;Earth Objects (NEO) population&#10;based on observations from the Asteroid Terrestrial&#45;impact Last Alert System&#10;(ATLAS) telescopes. We have applied similar methods used to develop the&#10;recently released NEO model generator (NEOMOD), once debiasing the NEO&#10;population using data from Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) G96 telescope. ATLAS is&#10;composed of four different telescopes. We first analyzed observational data&#10;from each of all four telescopes separately and later combined them. Our&#10;results highlight main differences between CSS and ATLAS, e.g., sky coverage&#10;and survey power at debiasing the NEO population. ATLAS has a much larger sky&#10;coverage than CSS, allowing it to find bright NEOs that would be constantly&#10;&quot;hiding&quot; from CSS. Consequently, ATLAS is more powerful than CSS at debiasing&#10;the NEO population for H $&#10;esssim$ 19. With its intrinsically greater&#10;sensitivity and emphasis on observing near opposition, CSS excels in the&#10;debiasing of smaller objects. ATLAS, as an all sky survey designed to find&#10;imminent hazardous objects, necessarily spends a significant fraction of time&#10;looking at places on the sky where objects do not appear, reducing its power&#10;for debiasing the population of small objects. We estimate a NEO population&#10;completeness of $approx$ 88%$^{+3%}_{&#45;2%}$ for H $&lt;$ 17.75 and $approx$&#10;36%$^{+1%}_{&#45;1%}$ for H $&lt;$ 22.25. Those numbers are similar to previous&#10;estimates (within error bars for H $&lt;$ 17.75) from CSS, yet, around 3% and 8%&#10;smaller at their face values, respectively. We also confirm previous finding&#10;that the $&#10;u_6$ secular resonance is the main source of small and faint NEOs&#10;at H = 28, whereas the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter dominates for&#10;larger and brighter NEOs at H = 15.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10453v1) |&#10;| Signed Graph Autoencoder for Explainable and Polarization&#45;Aware Network&#10; &#160;Embeddings | Nikolaos Nakis, Chrysoula Kosma, Giannis Nikolentzos, Michalis Chatzianastasis, Iakovos Evdaimon, Michalis Vazirgiannis | &#160;&#160;Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant&#10;attention in recent years for their ability to extract informative latent&#10;representations, characterizing the structure of complex topologies, such as&#10;graphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited&#10;focus on developing and evaluating explainable neural&#45;based graph generative&#10;models specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we&#10;propose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE&#10;extracts node&#45;level representations that express node memberships over distinct&#10;extreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is&#10;achieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its&#10;polarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for&#10;analyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with&#10;relational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation&#10;demonstrates the SGAAEs&#39; capability to successfully infer node memberships over&#10;the different underlying latent structures while extracting competing&#10;communities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the&#10;network. Additionally, we introduce the 2&#45;level network polarization problem&#10;and show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model&#10;achieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across&#10;four real&#45;world datasets, outperforming several baseline models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10452v1) |&#10;| Why you should also use OLS estimation of tail exponents | Thiago Trafane Oliveira Santos, Daniel Oliveira Cajueiro | &#160;&#160;Even though practitioners often estimate Pareto exponents running OLS&#10;rank&#45;size regressions, the usual recommendation is to use the Hill MLE with a&#10;small&#45;sample correction instead, due to its unbiasedness and efficiency. In&#10;this paper, we advocate that you should also apply OLS in empirical&#10;applications. On the one hand, we demonstrate that, with a small&#45;sample&#10;correction, the OLS estimator is also unbiased. On the other hand, we show that&#10;the MLE assigns significantly greater weight to smaller observations. This&#10;suggests that the OLS estimator may outperform the MLE in cases where the&#10;distribution is (i) strictly Pareto but only in the upper tail or (ii)&#10;regularly varying rather than strictly Pareto. We substantiate our theoretical&#10;findings with Monte Carlo simulations and real&#45;world applications,&#10;demonstrating the practical relevance of the OLS method in estimating tail&#10;exponents.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10448v1) |&#10;| Hydrodynamic hovering of swimming bacteria above surfaces | Pyae Hein Htet, Debasish Das, Eric Lauga | &#160;&#160;Flagellated bacteria are hydrodynamically attracted to rigid walls, yet past&#10;work shows a &#39;hovering&#39; state where they swim stably at a finite height above&#10;surfaces. We use numerics and theory to reveal the physical origin of hovering.&#10;Simulations first show that hovering requires an elongated cell body and&#10;results from a tilt away from the wall. Theoretical models then identify two&#10;essential asymmetries: the response of width&#45;asymmetric cells to active flows&#10;created by length&#45;asymmetric cells. A minimal model reconciles near and&#10;far&#45;field hydrodynamics, capturing all key features of hovering.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10447v1) |&#10;| KoroT&#45;3E: A Personalized Musical Mnemonics Tool for Enhancing Memory&#10; &#160;Retention of Complex Computer Science Concepts | Xiangzhe Yuan, Jiajun Wang, Siying Hu, Andrew Cheung, Zhicong Lu | &#160;&#160;As the demand for computer science (CS) skills grows, mastering foundational&#10;concepts is crucial yet challenging for novice learners. To address this&#10;challenge, we present KoroT&#45;3E, an AI&#45;based system that creates personalized&#10;musical mnemonics to enhance both memory retention and understanding of&#10;concepts in CS. KoroT&#45;3E enables users to transform complex concepts into&#10;memorable lyrics and compose melodies that suit their musical preferences. We&#10;conducted semi&#45;structured interviews (n=12) to investigate why novice learners&#10;find it challenging to memorize and understand CS concepts. The findings,&#10;combined with constructivist learning theory, established our initial design,&#10;which was then refined following consultations with CS education experts. An&#10;empirical experiment(n=36) showed that those using KoroT&#45;3E (n=18)&#10;significantly outperformed the control group (n=18), with improved memory&#10;efficiency, increased motivation, and a positive learning experience. These&#10;findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating multimodal generative AI&#10;into CS education to create personalized and interactive learning experiences.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10446v1) |&#10;| Deep&#45;Wide Learning Assistance for Insect Pest Classification | Toan Nguyen, Huy Nguyen, Huy Ung, Hieu Ung, Binh Nguyen | &#160;&#160;Accurate insect pest recognition plays a critical role in agriculture. It is&#10;a challenging problem due to the intricate characteristics of insects. In this&#10;paper, we present DeWi, novel learning assistance for insect pest&#10;classification. With a one&#45;stage and alternating training strategy, DeWi&#10;simultaneously improves several Convolutional Neural Networks in two&#10;perspectives: discrimination (by optimizing a triplet margin loss in a&#10;supervised training manner) and generalization (via data augmentation). From&#10;that, DeWi can learn discriminative and in&#45;depth features of insect pests&#10;(deep) yet still generalize well to a large number of insect categories (wide).&#10;Experimental results show that DeWi achieves the highest performances on two&#10;insect pest classification benchmarks (76.44% accuracy on the IP102 dataset&#10;and 99.79% accuracy on the D0 dataset, respectively). In addition, extensive&#10;evaluations and ablation studies are conducted to thoroughly investigate our&#10;DeWi and demonstrate its superiority.

Behavior trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robot&#10;task planning for their modularity and flexibility, but manually designing them&#10;can be effort&#45;intensive. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been&#10;applied in robotic task planning for generating action sequences, but their&#10;ability to generate BTs has not been fully investigated. To this end, We&#10;propose LLM as BT&#45;planner, a novel framework to leverage LLMs for BT generation&#10;in robotic assembly task planning and execution. Four in&#45;context learning&#10;methods are introduced to utilize the natural language processing and inference&#10;capabilities of LLMs to produce task plans in BT format, reducing manual effort&#10;and ensuring robustness and comprehensibility. We also evaluate the performance&#10;of fine&#45;tuned, fewer&#45;parameter LLMs on the same tasks. Experiments in simulated&#10;and real&#45;world settings show that our framework enhances LLMs&#39; performance in&#10;BT generation, improving success rates in BT generation through in&#45;context&#10;learning and supervised fine&#45;tuning.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10444v1) |&#10;| The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration. II.&#10; &#160;Mid&#45;Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy | Karl D. Gordon, G. C. Sloan, Macarena Garcia Marin, Mattia Libralato, George Rieke, Jonathan A. Aguilar, Ralph Bohlin, Misty Cracraft, Marjorie Decleir, Andras Gaspar, David R. Law, Alberto Noriega&#45;Crespo, Michael Regan | &#160;&#160;The absolute flux calibration of the Mid&#45;Infrared Instrument Imaging and&#10;Coronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first&#10;2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the&#10;flux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays,&#10;and different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining&#10;observed aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions&#10;based on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of&#10;these observations were combined with model point&#45;spread&#45;functions to measure&#10;the corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with&#10;time, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time,&#10;rate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations&#10;were with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately&#10;every month revealed a modest time&#45;dependent response loss seen mainly at the&#10;longest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential&#10;with a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the&#10;band&#45;dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was&#10;found to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different&#10;subarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting&#10;for the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors&#10;measured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The&#10;formal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are&#10;0.3 to 1.0%, with longer&#45;wavelength bands generally having larger&#10;uncertainties.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10443v1) |&#10;| CtRNet&#45;X: Camera&#45;to&#45;Robot Pose Estimation in Real&#45;world Conditions Using&#10; &#160;a Single Camera | Jingpei Lu, Zekai Liang, Tristin Xie, Florian Ritcher, Shan Lin, Sainan Liu, Michael C. Yip | &#160;&#160;Camera&#45;to&#45;robot calibration is crucial for vision&#45;based robot control and&#10;requires effort to make it accurate. Recent advancements in markerless pose&#10;estimation methods have eliminated the need for time&#45;consuming physical setups&#10;for camera&#45;to&#45;robot calibration. While the existing markerless pose estimation&#10;methods have demonstrated impressive accuracy without the need for cumbersome&#10;setups, they rely on the assumption that all the robot joints are visible&#10;within the camera&#39;s field of view. However, in practice, robots usually move in&#10;and out of view, and some portion of the robot may stay out&#45;of&#45;frame during the&#10;whole manipulation task due to real&#45;world constraints, leading to a lack of&#10;sufficient visual features and subsequent failure of these approaches. To&#10;address this challenge and enhance the applicability to vision&#45;based robot&#10;control, we propose a novel framework capable of estimating the robot pose with&#10;partially visible robot manipulators. Our approach leverages the&#10;Vision&#45;Language Models for fine&#45;grained robot components detection, and&#10;integrates it into a keypoint&#45;based pose estimation network, which enables more&#10;robust performance in varied operational conditions. The framework is evaluated&#10;on both public robot datasets and self&#45;collected partial&#45;view datasets to&#10;demonstrate our robustness and generalizability. As a result, this method is&#10;effective for robot pose estimation in a wider range of real&#45;world manipulation&#10;scenarios.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10441v1) |&#10;| Successive topological phase transitions in two distinct spin&#45;flop&#10; &#160;phases on the honeycomb lattice | Xudong Li, Jize Zhao, Jinbin Li, Qiang Luo | &#160;&#160;The Kitaev magnets with bond&#45;dependent interactions have garnered&#10;considerable attention in recent years for their ability to harbor exotic&#10;phases and nontrivial excitations. The topological magnons, which are indicated&#10;by nonzero Chern number and thermal Hall conductivity, are proposed to&#10;partially explain thermal Hall measurements in real materials. Hitherto,&#10;topological magnons have been extensively explored when the magnetic field is&#10;normal to the honeycomb plane, but their topological characteristics are less&#10;studied in the presence of in&#45;plane magnetic field. Here, we study two distinct&#10;in&#45;plane field induced spin&#45;flop phases in the $Gamma$&#45;$Gamma&#39;$ model, both&#10;of which are off&#45;diagonal couplings that have intimate relation to the Kitaev&#10;interaction. The two spin&#45;flop phases are distinguished by their out&#45;of&#45;plane&#10;spin components which can be either antiparallel or parallel, thus dubbing&#10;antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) spin&#45;flop phases, respectively.&#10;We map out topological phase diagrams for both phases, revealing a rich pattern&#10;of the Chern number over exchange parameters and magnetic field. We&#10;analytically calculate the boundaries of topological phase transitions when the&#10;magnetic field is along the $a$ and $b$ directions. We find that the thermal&#10;Hall conductivity and its derivative display contrasting behaviors when&#10;crossing different topological phase transitions. The striking difference of&#10;the two phases lies in that when the magnetic field is along the $b$ direction,&#10;topological magnons are totally absent in the AFM spin&#45;flop phase, while they&#10;can survive in the FM analogue in certain parameter regions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10439v1) |&#10;| A functorial approach to $n$&#45;abelian categories | Vitor Gulisz | &#160;&#160;We develop a functorial approach to the study of $n$&#45;abelian categories by&#10;reformulating their axioms in terms of their categories of finitely presented&#10;functors. Such an approach allows the use of classical homological algebra and&#10;representation theory techniques to understand higher homological algebra. As&#10;an application, we present two possible generalizations of the axioms &quot;every&#10;monomorphism is a kernel&quot; and &quot;every epimorphism is a cokernel&quot; of an abelian&#10;category to $n$&#45;abelian categories. We also specialize our results to modules&#10;over rings, thereby describing when the category of finitely generated&#10;projective modules over a ring is $n$&#45;abelian. Moreover, we establish a&#10;correspondence for $n$&#45;abelian categories with additive generators, which&#10;extends the higher Auslander correspondence.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10438v1) |&#10;| Color symmetry breaking in the Potts spin glass | Jean&#45;Christophe Mourrat | &#160;&#160;The Potts spin glass is an analogue of the Sherrington&#45;Kirkpatrick model in&#10;which each spin can take one of $kappa$ possible values, which we interpret as&#10;colors.

Whole genome sequence data augmented with demographic metadata&#10;provides the best opportunity to do this. We use Random Forest Decision Tree&#10;models to analyse a combination of over 4000 SARS&#45;CoV2 sequences from a densely&#10;sampled, mixed urban and rural population (Tayside) in Scotland in the period&#10;from August 2020 to July 2021, with fine scale geographical and&#10;socio&#45;demographic metadata. Comparing periods in versus out of &quot;lockdown&quot;&#10;restrictions, we show using genetic distance relationships that individuals&#10;from more deprived areas are more likely to get infected during lockdown but&#10;less likely to spread the infection further. As disadvantaged communities were&#10;the most affected by both COVID&#45;19 and its restrictions, our finding has&#10;important implications for informing future approaches to control future&#10;pandemics driven by similar respiratory infections.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10436v1) |&#10;| A study of pure multi&#45;strange hadrons production in Pb+Pb collisions at&#10; &#160;LHC energies using HYDJET++ model | Gauri Devi, B.

We have simulated the $p_{T}$&#45;spectra and elliptic flow ($v_{2}$)&#10;of $phi$&#45;meson and $Omega$&#45;baryons comparing our results with ALICE&#10;experimental data and several phenomenological models (HIJING/$Boverline{B}$,&#10;VISHNU, EPOS, AMPT, and Krakow) across various centrality intervals.&#10;Additionally, we have calculated the nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$ and&#10;$R_{CP}$), which provide a perception of jet quenching phenomena. Hence, our&#10;findings enable the study of the energy and system dependence of $phi$ and&#10;$Omega$ hadrons production over a wide range of ultra&#45;relativistic collision&#10;energies. We also present the particle ratios ($Omega/phi$,&#10;$overline{Omega}^{+}/Omega^{&#45;}$, $Omega/pi$, and $phi/pi$), offering&#10;insights on the strangeness enhancement and chemical properties of the medium&#10;at both LHC collision energies.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10435v1) |&#10;| Magnetic metamaterials by ion&#45;implantation | Christina Vantaraki, Petter Ström, Tuan T.

Synthesis is accomplished by&#10;combining electron&#45;beam lithography, used to generate nanometric patterned&#10;masks, with ion implantation in thin films. By implanting $^{56}$Fe$^{+}$ ions,&#10;we are able to introduce magnetic functionality in a controlled manner into&#10;continuous Pd thin films, achieving 3D spatial resolution down to a few tens of&#10;nanometers. Our results demonstrate the successful application of this&#10;technique in fabricating square artificial spin ice lattices, which exhibit&#10;well&#45;defined magnetization textures and interactions among the patterned&#10;magnetic elements.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10433v1) |&#10;| Structure&#45;preserving learning for multi&#45;symplectic PDEs | Süleyman Yıldız, Pawan Goyal, Peter Benner | &#160;&#160;This paper presents an energy&#45;preserving machine learning method for&#10;inferring reduced&#45;order models (ROMs) by exploiting the multi&#45;symplectic form&#10;of partial differential equations (PDEs). The vast majority of&#10;energy&#45;preserving reduced&#45;order methods use symplectic Galerkin projection to&#10;construct reduced&#45;order Hamiltonian models by projecting the full models onto a&#10;symplectic subspace. However, symplectic projection requires the existence of&#10;fully discrete operators, and in many cases, such as black&#45;box PDE solvers,&#10;these operators are inaccessible. In this work, we propose an energy&#45;preserving&#10;machine learning method that can infer the dynamics of the given PDE using data&#10;only, so that the proposed framework does not depend on the fully discrete&#10;operators. In this context, the proposed method is non&#45;intrusive. The proposed&#10;method is grey box in the sense that it requires only some basic knowledge of&#10;the multi&#45;symplectic model at the partial differential equation level. We prove&#10;that the proposed method satisfies spatially discrete local energy conservation&#10;and preserves the multi&#45;symplectic conservation laws. We test our method on the&#10;linear wave equation, the Korteweg&#45;de Vries equation, and the&#10;Zakharov&#45;Kuznetsov equation. We test the generalization of our learned models&#10;by testing them far outside the training time interval.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10432v1) |&#10;| Hippocampal synchronization in a realistic CA1 neuron model | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore | &#160;&#160;This work delves into studying the synchronization in two realistic neuron&#10;models using Hodgkin&#45;Huxley dynamics. Unlike simplistic point&#45;like models,&#10;excitatory synapses are here randomly distributed along the dendrites,&#10;introducing strong stochastic contributions into their signal propagation. To&#10;focus on the role of different excitatory positions, we use two copies of the&#10;same neuron whose synapses are located at different distances from the soma and&#10;are exposed to identical Poissonian distributed current pulses. The&#10;synchronization is investigated through a specifically defined spiking&#10;correlation function, and its behavior is analyzed as a function of several&#10;parameters: inhibition weight, distance from the soma of one synaptic group,&#10;excitatory inactivation delay, and weight of the excitatory synapses.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10431v1) |&#10;| Meta&#45;Whisper: Speech&#45;Based Meta&#45;ICL for ASR on Low&#45;Resource Languages | Ming&#45;Hao Hsu, Kuan Po Huang, Hung&#45;yi Lee | &#160;&#160;This paper presents Meta&#45;Whisper, a novel approach to improve automatic&#10;speech recognition (ASR) for low&#45;resource languages using the Whisper model.

This approach mitigates risks&#10;associated with compromised or untrusted devices, common in traditional quantum&#10;communication.&#10; &#160;In this paper, we propose the first of its kind DI&#45;QSDC protocol with user&#10;identity authentication. This ensures the authenticity of both the sender and&#10;receiver prior to message exchange. We then discuss the security of the&#10;proposed protocol against common attacks, demonstrating that no eavesdropper&#10;gains any information from either the quantum or the classical channel. Next,&#10;we implement the protocol on IBM&#39;s quantum hardware and evaluate its&#10;performance in a realistic noisy environment. Additionally, by simulating&#10;common attack models, we showcase that the protocol is secure against any&#10;eavesdropper in the channel.

Breakdown of&#10;time&#45;reversal symmetry (BTRS) is a hallmark of such dissipative non&#45;equilibrium&#10;dynamics. We introduce a robust, experimentally accessible, noninvasive,&#10;quantitative measure of BTRS in terms of the Kullback&#45;Leibler divergence in&#10;collision events, demonstrated in our novel artificial active matter, comprised&#10;of battery&#45;powered spherical rolling robots whose energetics in different modes&#10;of motion can be measured with high precision. Our dimensionless measure&#10;characterizes how dissipation and internal energetics are influenced by&#10;kinematic constraints from interactions with the environment. We propose this&#10;measure of BTRS as an empirical estimate of the distance from equilibrium. An&#10;energetic insight into this departure of active matter from equilibrium comes&#10;from our demonstration of a non&#45;trivial fluctuation symmetry, which reveals a&#10;potentially universal thermodynamic characteristic of active energetics. As a&#10;many&#45;body consequence of BTRS in our experimental active system, we demonstrate&#10;the emergence of activity&#45;induced herding, which has no equilibrium analogue.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10425v1) |&#10;| Unveiling V Modes: Enhancing CMB Sensitivity to BSM Physics with a&#10; &#160;Non&#45;Ideal Half&#45;Wave Plate | N. Raffuzzi, M. Lembo, S. Giardiello, M. Gerbino, M. Lattanzi, P. Natoli, L. Pagano | &#160;&#160;V&#45;mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background is expected to be&#10;vanishingly small in the $Lambda$CDM model and, hence, usually ignored.&#10;Nonetheless, several astrophysical effects, as well as beyond standard model&#10;physics could produce it at a detectable level. A realistic half&#45;wave plate &#45;&#10;an optical element commonly used in CMB experiments to modulate the polarized&#10;signal &#45; can provide sensitivity to V modes without significantly spoiling that&#10;to linear polarization. We assess this sensitivity for some new&#45;generation CMB&#10;experiments, such as the LiteBIRD satellite, the ground&#45;based Simons&#10;Observatory and a CMB&#45;S4&#45;like experiment. We forecast the efficiency of these&#10;experiments to constrain the phenomenology of certain classes of BSM models&#10;inducing mixing of linear polarization states and generation of V modes in the&#10;CMB. We find that new&#45;generation experiments can improve current limits by&#10;1&#45;to&#45;3 orders of magnitude, depending on the data combination. The inclusion of&#10;V&#45;mode information dramatically boosts the sensitivity to these BSM models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10424v1) |&#10;| Initial data for a deformed isolated horizon | Aleš Flandera, David Kofroň, Tomáš Ledvinka | &#160;&#160;Within the isolated horizon formalism, we investigate a static axisymmetric&#10;space&#45;time of a black hole influenced by matter in its neighborhood. To&#10;illustrate the role of ingredients and assumptions in this formalism, we first&#10;show how, in spherical symmetry, the field equations and gauge conditions imply&#10;the isolated horizon initial data leading to the Schwarzschild space&#45;time.&#10;Then, we construct the initial data for a static axisymmetric isolated horizon&#10;representing a deformed black hole. The space&#45;time description in the&#10;Bondi&#45;like coordinates is then found as a series expansion in the vicinity of&#10;the horizon. To graphically illustrate this construction, we also find a&#10;numerical solution for a black hole deformed by a particular analytic model of&#10;a thin accretion disk.

However,&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methods ignore a potentially valuable source of unsupervised&#10;semantic information &#45;&#45; spatial registration transforms between image volumes.&#10;To address this, we propose CCT&#45;R, a contrastive cross&#45;teaching framework&#10;incorporating registration information. To leverage the semantic information&#10;available in registrations between volume pairs, CCT&#45;R incorporates two&#10;proposed modules: Registration Supervision Loss (RSL) and Registration&#45;Enhanced&#10;Positive Sampling (REPS). The RSL leverages segmentation knowledge derived from&#10;transforms between labeled and unlabeled volume pairs, providing an additional&#10;source of pseudo&#45;labels. REPS enhances contrastive learning by identifying&#10;anatomically&#45;corresponding positives across volumes using registration&#10;transforms.

A number of recent methods have shown&#10;how to perform high&#45;dimensional, unbinned unfolding using machine learning.&#10;However, one of the assumptions in all of these methods is that the detector&#10;response is accurately modeled in the Monte Carlo simulation. In practice, the&#10;detector response depends on a number of nuisance parameters that can be&#10;constrained with data.

Given a text query, RGS&#10;determines a stable grasp pose to manipulate the referred object in the robot&#39;s&#10;workspace. RGS comprises two steps: visual grounding and grasp pose estimation.&#10;Recent studies leverage powerful Vision&#45;Language Models (VLMs) for visually&#10;grounding free&#45;flowing natural language in real&#45;world robotic execution.&#10;However, comparisons in complex, cluttered environments with multiple instances&#10;of the same object are lacking. This paper introduces HiFi&#45;CS, featuring&#10;hierarchical application of Featurewise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to fuse image&#10;and text embeddings, enhancing visual grounding for complex attribute rich text&#10;queries encountered in robotic grasping. Visual grounding associates an object&#10;in 2D/3D space with natural language input and is studied in two scenarios:&#10;Closed and Open Vocabulary. HiFi&#45;CS features a lightweight decoder combined&#10;with a frozen VLM and outperforms competitive baselines in closed vocabulary&#10;settings while being 100x smaller in size. Our model can effectively guide&#10;open&#45;set object detectors like GroundedSAM to enhance open&#45;vocabulary&#10;performance. We validate our approach through real&#45;world RGS experiments using&#10;a 7&#45;DOF robotic arm, achieving 90.33% visual grounding accuracy in 15 tabletop&#10;scenes.

Time&#45;lag studies can be used to constrain theoretical&#10;models. The observed time lags can be explained by thermal reprocessing of the&#10;X&#45;rays illuminating the accretion disc (known as the X&#45;ray reverberation&#10;model). However, the observed light curves contain more information that can be&#10;used to further constrain physical models. Our primary objective is to&#10;investigate whether, in addition to time lags, the X&#45;ray reverberation model&#10;can also explain the UV/optical variability amplitude of nearby Seyferts. To do&#10;this, we measured the excess variance of four sources (namely Mrk 509, NGC&#10;4151, NGC 2617, and Mrk 142) as a function of wavelength using data from&#10;archival long, multi&#45;wavelength campaigns with Swift, and ground&#45;based&#10;telescopes. We also computed the model excess variance in the case of the X&#45;ray&#10;reverberation model by determining the disc&#39;s transfer function and assuming a&#10;bending power law for the X&#45;ray power spectrum. We tested the validity of the&#10;model by comparing the measured and model variances for a range of accretion&#10;rates and X&#45;ray source heights. We conclude that the X&#45;ray thermal&#10;reverberation model can fit both the continuum, UV/optical time lags, as well&#10;as the variance in these AGNs, for the same physical parameters. Our results&#10;suggest that the accretion disc is constant and that all the observed&#10;UV/optical variations, on timescales of days and up to a few weeks, can be&#10;fully explained by the variable X&#45;rays as they illuminate the accretion disc.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10417v1) |&#10;| Local central limit theorem for Mallows measure | Alexey Bufetov, Kailun Chen | &#160;&#160;We study the statistics of the Mallows measure on permutations in the limit&#10;pioneered by Starr (2009). Our main result is the local central limit theorem&#10;for its height function.

Such walks, inspired by Ising&#45;like models and&#10;opinions dynamics models, are usually considered in one&#45;dimensional virtual&#10;spaces. Here, the mapping is done in such a way that the walk is directed along&#10;the $y$ axis while it can move either way along the $x$ axis. We explore the&#10;properties of such walks as the parameter representing the noise in the opinion&#10;dynamics model, responsible for a continuous phase transition, is varied. The&#10;walk features show marked differences as the system crosses the critical point.&#10;The bivariate distribution of the displacements below the critical point is a&#10;modified biased Gaussian function of x and y which is symmetric about the X&#10;axis.&#10; &#160;The marginal probability distributions can be extracted and the scaling forms&#10;of different quantities, showing power law behaviour, are obtained. The&#10;directed nature of the walk is reflected in the marginal distributions as well&#10;as in the exponents.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10413v1) |&#10;| A Large&#45;Scale Privacy Assessment of Android Third&#45;Party SDKs | Mark Huasong Meng, Chuan Yan, Yun Hao, Qing Zhang, Zeyu Wang, Kailong Wang, Sin Gee Teo, Guangdong Bai, Jin Song Dong | &#160;&#160;Third&#45;party Software Development Kits (SDKs) are widely adopted in Android&#10;app development, to effortlessly accelerate development pipelines and enhance&#10;app functionality. However, this convenience raises substantial concerns about&#10;unauthorized access to users&#39; privacy&#45;sensitive information, which could be&#10;further abused for illegitimate purposes like user tracking or monetization.&#10;Our study offers a targeted analysis of user privacy protection among Android&#10;third&#45;party SDKs, filling a critical gap in the Android software supply chain.&#10;It focuses on two aspects of their privacy practices, including data&#10;exfiltration and behavior&#45;policy compliance (or privacy compliance), utilizing&#10;techniques of taint analysis and large language models. It covers 158&#10;widely&#45;used SDKs from two key SDK release platforms, the official one and a&#10;large alternative one. From them, we identified 338 instances of privacy data&#10;exfiltration. On the privacy compliance, our study reveals that more than 30%&#10;of the examined SDKs fail to provide a privacy policy to disclose their data&#10;handling practices. Among those that provide privacy policies, 37% of them&#10;over&#45;collect user data, and 88% falsely claim access to sensitive data. We&#10;revisit the latest versions of the SDKs after 12 months. Our analysis&#10;demonstrates a persistent lack of improvement in these concerning trends. Based&#10;on our findings, we propose three actionable recommendations to mitigate the&#10;privacy leakage risks and enhance privacy protection for Android users. Our&#10;research not only serves as an urgent call for industry attention but also&#10;provides crucial insights for future regulatory interventions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10411v1) |&#10;| A point process approach for the classification of noisy calcium imaging&#10; &#160;data | Arianna Burzacchi, Nicoletta D&#39;Angelo, David Payares&#45;Garcia, Jorge Mateu | &#160;&#160;We study noisy calcium imaging data, with a focus on the classification of&#10;spike traces. As raw traces obscure the true temporal structure of neuron&#39;s&#10;activity, we performed a tuned filtering of the calcium concentration using two&#10;methods: a biophysical model and a kernel mapping. The former characterizes&#10;spike trains related to a particular triggering event, while the latter filters&#10;out the signal and refines the selection of the underlying neuronal response.&#10;Transitioning from traditional time series analysis to point process theory,&#10;the study explores spike&#45;time distance metrics and point pattern prototypes to&#10;describe repeated observations. We assume that the analyzed neuron&#39;s firing&#10;events, i.e. spike occurrences, are temporal point process events. In&#10;particular, the study aims to categorize 47 point patterns by depth, assuming&#10;the similarity of spike occurrences within specific depth categories. The&#10;results highlight the pivotal roles of depth and stimuli in discerning diverse&#10;temporal structures of neuron firing events, confirming the point process&#10;approach based on prototype analysis is largely useful in the classification of&#10;spike traces.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10409v1) |&#10;| Variational closures for composite homogenised fluid flows | Theo Diamantakis, Ruiao Hu | &#160;&#160;The Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport is a variational formulation of&#10;stochastic fluid dynamics introduced to model the effects of unresolved scales,&#10;whilst preserving the geometric structure of ideal fluid flows. In this work,&#10;we show that the SALT equations can arise from the decomposition of the fluid&#10;flow map into its mean and fluctuating components. The fluctuating component is&#10;realised as a prescribed stochastic diffeomorphism that introduces stochastic&#10;transport into the system and we construct it using homogenisation theory. The&#10;dynamics of the mean component are derived from a variational principle&#10;utilising particular forms of variations that preserve the composite structure&#10;of the flow. Using a new variational principle, we show that SALT equations can&#10;arise from random Lagrangians and are equivalent to random coefficient PDEs. We&#10;also demonstrate how to modify the composite flow and the associated&#10;variational principle to derive models inspired by the Lagrangian Averaged&#10;Euler&#45;Poincare (LAEP) theory.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10408v1) |&#10;| Bitcoin Transaction Behavior Modeling Based on Balance Data | Yu Zhang, Claudio Tessone | &#160;&#160;When analyzing Bitcoin users&#39; balance distribution, we observed that it&#10;follows a log&#45;normal pattern. Drawing parallels from the successful application&#10;of Gibrat&#39;s law of proportional growth in explaining city size and word&#10;frequency distributions, we tested whether the same principle could account for&#10;the log&#45;normal distribution in Bitcoin balances. However, our calculations&#10;revealed that the exponent parameters in both the drift and variance terms&#10;deviate slightly from one. This suggests that Gibrat&#39;s proportional growth rule&#10;alone does not fully explain the log&#45;normal distribution observed in Bitcoin&#10;users&#39; balances. During our exploration, we discovered an intriguing&#10;phenomenon: Bitcoin users tend to fall into two distinct categories based on&#10;their behavior, which we refer to as ``poor&quot; and ``wealthy&quot; users. Poor users,&#10;who initially purchase only a small amount of Bitcoin, tend to buy more&#10;bitcoins first and then sell out all their holdings gradually over time. The&#10;certainty of selling all their coins is higher and higher with time. In&#10;contrast, wealthy users, who acquire a large amount of Bitcoin from the start,&#10;tend to sell off their holdings over time. The speed at which they sell their&#10;bitcoins is lower and lower over time and they will hold at least a small part&#10;of their initial holdings at last. Interestingly, the wealthier the user, the&#10;larger the proportion of their balance and the higher the certainty they tend&#10;to sell. This research provided an interesting perspective to explore bitcoin&#10;users&#39; behaviors which may apply to other finance markets.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10407v1) |&#10;| Stochastic Data&#45;Driven Predictive Control: Chance&#45;Constraint&#10; &#160;Satisfaction with Identified Multi&#45;step Predictors | Haldun Balim, Andrea Carron, Melanie N. Zeilinger, Johannes Köhler | &#160;&#160;We propose a novel data&#45;driven stochastic model predictive control framework&#10;for uncertain linear systems with noisy output measurements. Our approach&#10;leverages multi&#45;step predictors to efficiently propagate uncertainty, ensuring&#10;chance constraint satisfaction with minimal conservatism. In particular, we&#10;present a strategy to identify multi&#45;step predictors and quantify the&#10;associated uncertainty using a surrogate (data&#45;driven) state space model. Then,&#10;we utilize the derived distribution to formulate a constraint tightening that&#10;ensures chance constraint satisfaction. A numerical example highlights the&#10;reduced conservatism of handling parametric uncertainty in the proposed method&#10;compared to state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art solutions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10405v1) |&#10;| A Knowledge&#45;Enhanced Disease Diagnosis Method Based on Prompt Learning&#10; &#160;and BERT Integration | Zhang Zheng | &#160;&#160;This paper proposes a knowledge&#45;enhanced disease diagnosis method based on a&#10;prompt learning framework. The method retrieves structured knowledge from&#10;external knowledge graphs related to clinical cases, encodes it, and injects it&#10;into the prompt templates to enhance the language model&#39;s understanding and&#10;reasoning capabilities for the task.We conducted experiments on three public&#10;datasets: CHIP&#45;CTC, IMCS&#45;V2&#45;NER, and KUAKE&#45;QTR. The results show that the&#10;proposed method significantly outperforms existing models across multiple&#10;evaluation metrics, with an F1 score improvement of 2.4% on the CHIP&#45;CTC&#10;dataset, 3.1% on the IMCS&#45;V2&#45;NER dataset,and 4.2% on the KUAKE&#45;QTR dataset.&#10;Additionally,ablation studies confirmed the critical role of the knowledge&#10;injection module,as the removal of this module resulted in a significant drop&#10;in F1 score. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not&#10;only effectively improves the accuracy of disease diagnosis but also enhances&#10;the interpretability of the predictions, providing more reliable support and&#10;evidence for clinical diagnosis.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10403v1) |&#10;| A Statistical Equilibrium Approach to Adam Smith&#39;s Labor Theory of Value | Ellis Scharfenaker, Bruno Theodosio, Duncan K.

In meiosis II mouse oocytes (developing egg cells) awaiting&#10;fertilisation, the spindle, which is the protein structure responsible for&#10;dividing genetic material in a cell, must maintain its position near the cell&#10;cortex (the thin actin network bound to the cell membrane) for many hours.&#10;However, the cytoplasmic streaming that accompanies this stable positioning&#10;would intuitively appear to destabilise the spindle position. Here, through a&#10;combination of numerical and analytical modelling, we reveal a new,&#10;hydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning beneath the cortical cap.&#10;We show that this stability depends critically on the spindle size and the&#10;active driving from the cortex, and demonstrate that stable spindle positioning&#10;can result purely from a hydrodynamic suction force exerted on the spindle by&#10;the cytoplasmic flow. Our findings show that local fluid dynamic forces can be&#10;sufficient to stabilise the spindle, explaining robustness against&#10;perturbations not only perpendicular but also parallel to the cortex. Our&#10;results shed light on the importance of cytoplasmic streaming in mammalian&#10;meiosis.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10401v1) |&#10;| Sherpa: An Open Source Python Fitting Package | Aneta Siemiginowska, Douglas Burke, Hans Moritz Günther, Nicholas P.

Dejrah | &#160;&#160;We focus on the inflationary predictions of $beta$&#45;exponential potential&#10;models, in which the inflaton is a representation of the field delineating the&#10;size of extra&#45;dimension. Since it offers a well&#45;motivated starting point for&#10;the study of physics at very high energies, we incorporate an $R^2$ term in the&#10;Palatini gravity. In addition, afterward the inflation, the inflaton oscillates&#10;about the minimum of the inflation potential, and reheats the universe. This&#10;occurs during the reheating phase, at which the inflaton decays into the&#10;standard model particles, which fill the universe. We extend our examination by&#10;considering the reheating effects on inflationary observables by employing the&#10;different scenarios of the reheat temperature. Supposing the standard thermal&#10;history after inflation, we display the inflationary predictions, $n_s, r,&#10;mathrm{d}n_s/mathrm{d}&#10;n k$ of $beta$&#45;exponential potential with minimal&#10;coupling in Palatini $R^2$ gravity. Also, different kinds of constraints from a&#10;variety of observations, such as BICEP/Keck, Planck 2018, as well as future&#10;possible detectable sensitivities that might be reached by CMB experiments:&#10;CMB&#45;S4 and LiteBIRD are taken into account in this work. We indicate that our&#10;results are consistent with both the latest data and the future sensitivity&#10;forecasts of LiteBIRD/Planck and CMB&#45;S4. Finally, the results in this study&#10;highlight the viability of our model even in the case of the existence of more&#10;stringent constraints expected from future achievable confidence level limits.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10398v1) |&#10;| Quantifying Observational Projection Effects with a Simulation&#45;based hot&#10; &#160;CGM model | Soumya Shreeram, Johan Comparat, Andrea Merloni, Yi Zhang, Gabriele Ponti, Kirpal Nandra, John ZuHone, Ilaria Marini, Stephan Vladutescu&#45;Zopp, Paola Popesso, Ruediger Pakmor, Riccardo Seppi, Celine Peroux, Daniele Sorini | &#160;&#160;The hot phase of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) allows us to probe the&#10;inflow and outflow of gas within a galaxy, which is responsible for dictating&#10;the evolution of the galaxy. Studying the hot CGM sheds light on a better&#10;understanding of gas physics, which is crucial to inform and constrain&#10;simulation models. With the recent advances in observational measurements&#10;probing the hot CGM in X&#45;rays and tSZ, we have a new avenue for widening our&#10;knowledge of gas physics and feedback by exploiting the information from&#10;current/future observations. In this paper, we use the TNG300 hydrodynamical&#10;simulations to build a fully self&#45;consistent forward model for the hot CGM. We&#10;construct a lightcone and generate mock X&#45;ray observations. We quantify the&#10;projection effects, namely the locally correlated large&#45;scale structure in&#10;X&#45;rays and the effect due to satellite galaxies misclassified as centrals which&#10;affects the measured hot CGM galactocentric profiles in stacking experiments.&#10;We present an analytical model that describes the intrinsic X&#45;ray surface&#10;brightness profile across the stellar and halo mass bins. The increasing&#10;stellar mass bins result in decreasing values of $beta$, the exponent&#10;quantifying the slope of the intrinsic galactocentric profiles. We carry&#10;forward the current state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art by also showing the impact of the locally&#10;correlated environment on the measured X&#45;ray surface brightness profiles. We&#10;also present, for the first time, the effect of misclassified centrals in&#10;stacking experiments for three stellar mass bins: $10^{10.5&#45;11} M_odot$,&#10;$10^{11&#45;11.2} M_odot$, and $10^{11.2&#45;11.5} M_odot$. We find that the&#10;contaminating effect of the misclassified centrals on the stacked profiles&#10;increases when the stellar mass decreases.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10397v1) |&#10;| MOST: MR reconstruction Optimization for multiple downStream Tasks via&#10; &#160;continual learning | Hwihun Jeong, Se Young Chun, Jongho Lee | &#160;&#160;Deep learning&#45;based Magnetic Resonance (MR) reconstruction methods have&#10;focused on generating high&#45;quality images but they often overlook the impact on&#10;downstream tasks (e.g., segmentation) that utilize the reconstructed images.&#10;Cascading separately trained reconstruction network and downstream task network&#10;has been shown to introduce performance degradation due to error propagation&#10;and domain gaps between training datasets. To mitigate this issue, downstream&#10;task&#45;oriented reconstruction optimization has been proposed for a single&#10;downstream task. Expanding this optimization to multi&#45;task scenarios is not&#10;straightforward. In this work, we extended this optimization to sequentially&#10;introduced multiple downstream tasks and demonstrated that a single MR&#10;reconstruction network can be optimized for multiple downstream tasks by&#10;deploying continual learning (MOST). MOST integrated techniques from&#10;replay&#45;based continual learning and image&#45;guided loss to overcome catastrophic&#10;forgetting. Comparative experiments demonstrated that MOST outperformed a&#10;reconstruction network without finetuning, a reconstruction network with&#10;na&quot;ive finetuning, and conventional continual learning methods. This&#10;advancement empowers the application of a single MR reconstruction network for&#10;multiple downstream tasks.

In particular, we analyse the task of&#10;textit{multicopy state teleportation}, where Alice has $k$ identical copies of&#10;an arbitrary unknown $d$&#45;dimensional qudit state $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to teleport&#10;a single copy of $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to Bob using a maximally entangled&#10;two&#45;qudit state shared between Alice and Bob without Bob&#39;s correction. Alice&#10;may perform a joint measurement on her half of the entangled state and the $k$&#10;copies of $vertpsi&#13;angle$. We prove that the maximal probability of success&#10;for teleporting the exact state $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to Bob is&#10;$p(d,k)=frac{k}{d(k&#45;1+d)}$ and present an explicit protocol to attain this&#10;performance. Then, by utilising $k$ copies of an arbitrary target state&#10;$vertpsi&#13;angle$, we show how the multicopy state teleportation protocol can&#10;be employed to enhance the success probability of storage and retrieval of&#10;quantum programs, which aims to universally retrieve the action of an arbitrary&#10;quantum channel that is stored in a state. Our proofs make use of group&#10;representation theory methods, which may find applications beyond the problems&#10;addressed in this work.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10393v1) |&#10;| TPFL: Tsetlin&#45;Personalized Federated Learning with Confidence&#45;Based&#10; &#160;Clustering | Rasoul Jafari Gohari, Laya Aliahmadipour, Ezat Valipour | &#160;&#160;The world of Machine Learning (ML) has witnessed rapid changes in terms of&#10;new models and ways to process users data. The majority of work that has been&#10;done is focused on Deep Learning (DL) based approaches. However, with the&#10;emergence of new algorithms such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm, there&#10;is growing interest in exploring alternative approaches that may offer unique&#10;advantages in certain domains or applications. One of these domains is&#10;Federated Learning (FL), in which users privacy is of utmost importance. Due to&#10;its novelty, FL has seen a surge in the incorporation of personalization&#10;techniques to enhance model accuracy while maintaining user privacy under&#10;personalized conditions. In this work, we propose a novel approach dubbed TPFL:&#10;Tsetlin&#45;Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into&#10;clusters based on their confidence towards a specific class. In this way,&#10;clustering can benefit from two key advantages. Firstly, clients share only&#10;what they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight&#10;aggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been&#10;enough during the training. This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are&#10;non&#45;Independent and Identically Distributed (non&#45;IID). Secondly, by sharing&#10;only weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially&#10;reduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication&#10;cost. The results of TPFL demonstrated the highest accuracy on three different&#10;datasets; namely MNIST, FashionMNIST and FEMNIST.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10392v1) |&#10;| Prompt&#45;and&#45;Transfer: Dynamic Class&#45;aware Enhancement for Few&#45;shot&#10; &#160;Segmentation | Hanbo Bi, Yingchao Feng, Wenhui Diao, Peijin Wang, Yongqiang Mao, Kun Fu, Hongqi Wang, Xian Sun | &#160;&#160;For more efficient generalization to unseen domains (classes), most Few&#45;shot&#10;Segmentation (FSS) would directly exploit pre&#45;trained encoders and only&#10;fine&#45;tune the decoder, especially in the current era of large models. However,&#10;such fixed feature encoders tend to be class&#45;agnostic, inevitably activating&#10;objects that are irrelevant to the target class. In contrast, humans can&#10;effortlessly focus on specific objects in the line of sight. This paper mimics&#10;the visual perception pattern of human beings and proposes a novel and powerful&#10;prompt&#45;driven scheme, called ``Prompt and Transfer&quot; (PAT), which constructs a&#10;dynamic class&#45;aware prompting paradigm to tune the encoder for focusing on the&#10;interested object (target class) in the current task. Three key points are&#10;elaborated to enhance the prompting: 1) Cross&#45;modal linguistic information is&#10;introduced to initialize prompts for each task. 2) Semantic Prompt Transfer&#10;(SPT) that precisely transfers the class&#45;specific semantics within the images&#10;to prompts. 3) Part Mask Generator (PMG) that works in conjunction with SPT to&#10;adaptively generate different but complementary part prompts for different&#10;individuals. Surprisingly, PAT achieves competitive performance on 4 different&#10;tasks including standard FSS, Cross&#45;domain FSS (e.g., CV, medical, and remote&#10;sensing domains), Weak&#45;label FSS, and Zero&#45;shot Segmentation, setting new&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;arts on 11 benchmarks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10389v1) |&#10;| Revising the Structure of Recurrent Neural Networks to Eliminate&#10; &#160;Numerical Derivatives in Forming Physics Informed Loss Terms with Respect to&#10; &#160;Time | Mahyar Jahani&#45;nasab, Mohamad Ali Bijarchi | &#160;&#160;Solving unsteady partial differential equations (PDEs) using recurrent neural&#10;networks (RNNs) typically requires numerical derivatives between each block of&#10;the RNN to form the physics informed loss function. However, this introduces&#10;the complexities of numerical derivatives into the training process of these&#10;models. In this study, we propose modifying the structure of the traditional&#10;RNN to enable the prediction of each block over a time interval, making it&#10;possible to calculate the derivative of the output with respect to time using&#10;the backpropagation algorithm. To achieve this, the time intervals of these&#10;blocks are overlapped, defining a mutual loss function between them.&#10;Additionally, the employment of conditional hidden states enables us to achieve&#10;a unique solution for each block. The forget factor is utilized to control the&#10;influence of the conditional hidden state on the prediction of the subsequent&#10;block. This new model, termed the Mutual Interval RNN (MI&#45;RNN), is applied to&#10;solve three different benchmarks: the Burgers equation, unsteady heat&#10;conduction in an irregular domain, and the Green vortex problem. Our results&#10;demonstrate that MI&#45;RNN can find the exact solution more accurately compared to&#10;existing RNN models. For instance, in the second problem, MI&#45;RNN achieved one&#10;order of magnitude less relative error compared to the RNN model with numerical&#10;derivatives.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10388v1) |&#10;| Sharp decay rate for eigenfunctions of perturbed periodic Schrödinger&#10; &#160;operators | Wencai Liu, Rodrigo Matos, John N.

Key applications include the absence of embedded eigenvalues for&#10;operators with impurities decaying faster than any exponential function and the&#10;determination of sharp decay rates for eigenfunctions. Our findings extend&#10;previous works by providing precise decay conditions for impurities and&#10;analyzing different spectral regimes of $&#10;ambda$.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10387v1) |&#10;| Mamba&#45;ST: State Space Model for Efficient Style Transfer | Filippo Botti, Alex Ergasti, Leonardo Rossi, Tomaso Fontanini, Claudio Ferrari, Massimo Bertozzi, Andrea Prati | &#160;&#160;The goal of style transfer is, given a content image and a style source,&#10;generating a new image preserving the content but with the artistic&#10;representation of the style source. Most of the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art architectures&#10;use transformers or diffusion&#45;based models to perform this task, despite the&#10;heavy computational burden that they require. In particular, transformers use&#10;self&#45; and cross&#45;attention layers which have large memory footprint, while&#10;diffusion models require high inference time. To overcome the above, this paper&#10;explores a novel design of Mamba, an emergent State&#45;Space Model (SSM), called&#10;Mamba&#45;ST, to perform style transfer. To do so, we adapt Mamba linear equation&#10;to simulate the behavior of cross&#45;attention layers, which are able to combine&#10;two separate embeddings into a single output, but drastically reducing memory&#10;usage and time complexity. We modified the Mamba&#39;s inner equations so to accept&#10;inputs from, and combine, two separate data streams. To the best of our&#10;knowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt the equations of SSMs to a vision&#10;task like style transfer without requiring any other module like&#10;cross&#45;attention or custom normalization layers. An extensive set of experiments&#10;demonstrates the superiority and efficiency of our method in performing style&#10;transfer compared to transformers and diffusion models. Results show improved&#10;quality in terms of both ArtFID and FID metrics.

This module employs the Z4c formulation to solve the Einstein&#10;equations. We demonstrate its accuracy through a series of standard numerical&#10;relativity tests, including convergence of the gravitational waveform from&#10;binary black hole coalescence. Furthermore, we conduct scaling tests on OLCF&#10;Frontier and NERSC Perlmutter, where AthenaK exhibits excellent weak scaling&#10;efficiency of 80% on up to 65,536 AMD MI250X GPUs on Frontier (relative to 4&#10;GPUs) and strong scaling efficiencies of 84% and 77% on AMD MI250X and NVIDIA&#10;A100 GPUs on Frontier and Perlmutter respectively. Additionally, we observe a&#10;significant performance boost, with two orders of magnitude speedup ($gtrsim&#10;200times$) on a GPU compared to a single CPU core, affirming that AthenaK is&#10;well&#45;suited for exascale computing, thereby expanding the potential for&#10;breakthroughs in numerical relativity research.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10383v1) |&#10;| J&#45;UBIK: The JAX&#45;accelerated Universal Bayesian Imaging Kit | Vincent Eberle, Matteo Guardiani, Margret Westerkamp, Philipp Frank, Julian Rüstig, Julia Stadler, Torsten A. Enßlin | &#160;&#160;Many advances in astronomy and astrophysics originate from accurate images of&#10;the sky emission across multiple wavelengths. This often requires&#10;reconstructing spatially and spectrally correlated signals detected from&#10;multiple instruments. To facilitate the high&#45;fidelity imaging of these signals,&#10;we introduce the universal Bayesian imaging kit (UBIK). Specifically, we&#10;present J&#45;UBIK, a flexible and modular implementation leveraging the&#10;JAX&#45;accelerated NIFTy.re software as its backend. J&#45;UBIK streamlines the&#10;implementation of the key Bayesian inference components, providing for all the&#10;necessary steps of Bayesian imaging pipelines. First, it provides adaptable&#10;prior models for different sky realizations. Second, it includes likelihood&#10;models tailored to specific instruments. So far, the package includes three&#10;instruments: Chandra and eROSITA for X&#45;ray observations, and the James Webb&#10;Space Telescope (JWST) for the near&#45; and mid&#45;infrared. The aim is to expand&#10;this set in the future. Third, these models can be integrated with various&#10;inference and optimization schemes, such as maximum a posteriori estimation and&#10;variational inference. Explicit demos show how to integrate the individual&#10;modules into a full analysis pipeline. Overall, J&#45;UBIK enables efficient&#10;generation of high&#45;fidelity images via Bayesian pipelines that can be tailored&#10;to specific research objectives.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10381v1) |&#10;| Thermolectricity in irradiated bilayer graphene flakes | Cynthia Ihuoma Osuala, Tanu Choudhary, Raju K. Biswas, Sudin Ganguly, Chunlei Qu, Santanu K. Maiti | &#160;&#160;We present a comprehensive study on enhancing the thermoelectric (TE)&#10;performance of bilayer graphene (BLG) through irradiation with arbitrarily&#10;polarized light, focusing on $AA$&#45; and $AB$&#45;stacked configurations with zigzag&#10;edges. Utilizing a combination of tight&#45;binding theory and density functional&#10;theory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on&#10;electronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the&#10;electronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function,&#10;which significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the&#10;overall {it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT&#10;calculations reveal that $AB$&#45;stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal&#10;conductivity compared to $AA$&#45;stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic&#10;scattering and phonon group velocity. The combined analysis shows that FOM&#10;exceeds unity in both stacking types, with notable improvements near the&#10;irradiation&#45;induced gap. Additionally, we explore the dependence of FOM on the&#10;system dimensions and temperature, demonstrating that light&#45;irradiated BLG&#10;holds great promise for efficient thermoelectric energy conversion and waste&#10;heat recovery. Our results show favorable responses over a wide range of&#10;irradiation parameters. These findings provide crucial insights into optimizing&#10;BLG for advanced TE applications through light&#45;induced modifications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10380v1) |&#10;| Leveraging Joint Spectral and Spatial Learning with MAMBA for&#10; &#160;Multichannel Speech Enhancement | Wenze Ren, Haibin Wu, Yi&#45;Cheng Lin, Xuanjun Chen, Rong Chao, Kuo&#45;Hsuan Hung, You&#45;Jin Li, Wen&#45;Yuan Ting, Hsin&#45;Min Wang, Yu Tsao | &#160;&#160;In multichannel speech enhancement, effectively capturing spatial and&#10;spectral information across different microphones is crucial for noise&#10;reduction. Traditional methods, such as CNN or LSTM, attempt to model the&#10;temporal dynamics of full&#45;band and sub&#45;band spectral and spatial features.&#10;However, these approaches face limitations in fully modeling complex temporal&#10;dependencies, especially in dynamic acoustic environments. To overcome these&#10;challenges, we modify the current advanced model McNet by introducing an&#10;improved version of Mamba, a state&#45;space model, and further propose MCMamba.&#10;MCMamba has been completely reengineered to integrate full&#45;band and narrow&#45;band&#10;spatial information with sub&#45;band and full&#45;band spectral features, providing a&#10;more comprehensive approach to modeling spatial and spectral information. Our&#10;experimental results demonstrate that MCMamba significantly improves the&#10;modeling of spatial and spectral features in multichannel speech enhancement,&#10;outperforming McNet and achieving state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art performance on the CHiME&#45;3&#10;dataset. Additionally, we find that Mamba performs exceptionally well in&#10;modeling spectral information.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10376v1) |&#10;| Nonlinear Causality in Brain Networks: With Application to Motor Imagery&#10; &#160;vs Execution | Sipan Aslan, Hernando Ombao | &#160;&#160;One fundamental challenge of data&#45;driven analysis in neuroscience is modeling&#10;causal interactions and exploring the connectivity of nodes in a brain network.&#10;Various statistical methods, relying on various perspectives and employing&#10;different data modalities, are being developed to examine and comprehend the&#10;underlying causal structures inherent to brain dynamics. This study introduces&#10;a novel statistical approach, TAR4C, to dissect causal interactions in&#10;multichannel EEG recordings. TAR4C uses the threshold autoregressive model to&#10;describe the causal interaction between nodes or clusters of nodes in a brain&#10;network. The perspective involves testing whether one node, which may represent&#10;a brain region, can control the dynamics of the other. The node that has such&#10;an impact on the other is called a threshold variable and can be classified as&#10;a causative because its functionality is the leading source operating as an&#10;instantaneous switching mechanism that regulates the time&#45;varying&#10;autoregressive structure of the other. This statistical concept is commonly&#10;referred to as threshold non&#45;linearity. Once threshold non&#45;linearity has been&#10;verified between a pair of nodes, the subsequent essential facet of TAR&#10;modeling is to assess the predictive ability of the causal node for the current&#10;activity on the other and represent causal interactions in autoregressive&#10;terms. This predictive ability is what underlies Granger causality. The TAR4C&#10;approach can discover non&#45;linear and time&#45;dependent causal interactions without&#10;negating the G&#45;causality perspective. The efficacy of the proposed approach is&#10;exemplified by analyzing the EEG signals recorded during the motor&#10;movement/imagery experiment. The similarities and differences between the&#10;causal interactions manifesting during the execution and the imagery of a given&#10;motor movement are demonstrated by analyzing EEG recordings from multiple&#10;subjects.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10374v1) |&#10;| Instigating Cooperation among LLM Agents Using Adaptive Information&#10; &#160;Modulation | Qiliang Chen, &#160;Alireza, &#160;Ilami, Nunzio Lore, Babak Heydari | &#160;&#160;This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for&#10;human strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these&#10;agents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments. Our&#10;approach extends traditional agent&#45;based simulations by using strategic LLM&#10;agents (SLA) and introducing dynamic and adaptive governance through a&#10;pro&#45;social promoting RL agent (PPA) that modulates information access across&#10;agents in a network, optimizing social welfare and promoting pro&#45;social&#10;behavior. Through validation in iterative games, including the prisoner&#10;dilemma, we demonstrate that SLA agents exhibit nuanced strategic adaptations.&#10;The PPA agent effectively learns to adjust information transparency, resulting&#10;in enhanced cooperation rates. This framework offers significant insights into&#10;AI&#45;mediated social dynamics, contributing to the deployment of AI in real&#45;world&#10;team settings.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10372v1) |&#10;| Learning Gentle Grasping from Human&#45;Free Force Control Demonstration | Mingxuan Li, Lunwei Zhang, Tiemin Li, Yao Jiang | &#160;&#160;Humans can steadily and gently grasp unfamiliar objects based on tactile&#10;perception. Robots still face challenges in achieving similar performance due&#10;to the difficulty of learning accurate grasp&#45;force predictions and force&#10;control strategies that can be generalized from limited data. In this article,&#10;we propose an approach for learning grasping from ideal force control&#10;demonstrations, to achieve similar performance of human hands with limited data&#10;size. Our approach utilizes objects with known contact characteristics to&#10;automatically generate reference force curves without human demonstrations. In&#10;addition, we design the dual convolutional neural networks (Dual&#45;CNN)&#10;architecture which incorporating a physics&#45;based mechanics module for learning&#10;target grasping force predictions from demonstrations. The described method can&#10;be effectively applied in vision&#45;based tactile sensors and enables gentle and&#10;stable grasping of objects from the ground. The described prediction model and&#10;grasping strategy were validated in offline evaluations and online experiments,&#10;and the accuracy and generalizability were demonstrated.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10371v1) |&#10;| Uncovering the Mechanism of Hepatotoxiciy of PFAS Targeting L&#45;FABP Using&#10; &#160;GCN and Computational Modeling | Lucas Jividen, Tibo Duran, Xi&#45;Zhi Niu, Jun Bai | &#160;&#160;Per&#45; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental&#10;pollutants with known toxicity and bioaccumulation issues. Their widespread&#10;industrial use and resistance to degradation have led to global environmental&#10;contamination and significant health concerns. While a minority of PFAS have&#10;been extensively studied, the toxicity of many PFAS remains poorly understood&#10;due to limited direct toxicological data. This study advances the predictive&#10;modeling of PFAS toxicity by combining semi&#45;supervised graph convolutional&#10;networks (GCNs) with molecular descriptors and fingerprints. We propose a novel&#10;approach to enhance the prediction of PFAS binding affinities by isolating&#10;molecular fingerprints to construct graphs where then descriptors are set as&#10;the node features. This approach specifically captures the structural,&#10;physicochemical, and topological features of PFAS without overfitting due to an&#10;abundance of features. Unsupervised clustering then identifies representative&#10;compounds for detailed binding studies. Our results provide a more accurate&#10;ability to estimate PFAS hepatotoxicity to provide guidance in chemical&#10;discovery of new PFAS and the development of new safety regulations.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10370v1) |&#10;| Stochastic Control of UAVs: An Optimal Tradeoff between Performance,&#10; &#160;Flight Smoothness and Control Effort | George Rapakoulias, Panagiotis Tsiotras | &#160;&#160;Safe and accurate control of unmanned aerial vehicles in the presence of&#10;winds is a challenging control problem due to the hard&#45;to&#45;model and highly&#10;stochastic nature of the disturbance forces acting upon the vehicle. To meet&#10;performance constraints, state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art control methods such as Incremental&#10;Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) or other adaptive control techniques require&#10;high control gains to mitigate the effects of uncertainty entering the system.&#10;While achieving good tracking performance, IDNI requires excessive control&#10;effort, results in high actuator strain, and reduced flight smoothness due to&#10;constant and aggressive corrective actions commanded by the controller. In this&#10;paper, we propose a novel control architecture that allows the user to&#10;systematically address the trade&#45;off between high authority control and&#10;performance constraint satisfaction. Our approach consists of two parts. To&#10;cancel out biases introduced by unmodelled aerodynamic effects we propose a&#10;hybrid, model&#45;based disturbance force estimator augmented with a neural&#10;network, that can adapt to external wind conditions using a Kalman Filter. We&#10;then utilize state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art results from Covariance Steering theory, which&#10;offers a principled way of controlling the uncertainty of the tracking error&#10;dynamics. We first analyze the properties of the combined system and then&#10;provide extensive experimental results to verify the advantages of the proposed&#10;approach over existing methods&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10369v1) |&#10;| Integrated nowcasting of convective precipitation with Transformer&#45;based&#10; &#160;models using multi&#45;source data | Çağlar Küçük, Aitor Atencia, Markus Dabernig | &#160;&#160;Precipitation nowcasting is crucial for mitigating the impacts of severe&#10;weather events and supporting daily activities. Conventional models&#10;predominantly relying on radar data have limited performance in predicting&#10;cases with complex temporal features such as convection initiation,&#10;highlighting the need to integrate data from other sources for more&#10;comprehensive nowcasting. Unlike physics&#45;based models, machine learning&#10;(ML)&#45;based models offer promising solutions for efficiently integrating large&#10;volumes of diverse data. We present EF4INCA, a spatiotemporal Transformer model&#10;for precipitation nowcasting that integrates satellite&#45; and ground&#45;based&#10;observations with numerical weather prediction outputs. EF4INCA provides&#10;high&#45;resolution forecasts over Austria, accurately predicting the location and&#10;shape of precipitation fields with a spatial resolution of 1 kilometre and a&#10;temporal resolution of 5 minutes, up to 90 minutes ahead. Our evaluation shows&#10;that EF4INCA outperforms conventional nowcasting models, including the&#10;operational model of Austria, particularly in scenarios with complex temporal&#10;features such as convective initiation and rapid weather changes. EF4INCA&#10;maintains higher accuracy in location forecasting but generates smoother fields&#10;at later prediction times compared to traditional models. Interpretation of our&#10;model showed that precipitation products and SEVIRI infrared channels CH7 and&#10;CH9 are the most important data streams. These results underscore the&#10;importance of combining data from different domains, including physics&#45;based&#10;model products, with ML approaches. Our study highlights the robustness of&#10;EF4INCA and its potential for improved precipitation nowcasting. We provide&#10;access to our code repository, model weights, and the dataset curated for&#10;benchmarking, facilitating further development and application.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10367v1) |&#10;&#10;">

Hill, Matthias Kluge, Martin Landriau, Ximena Mazzalay, Eva Noyola, Taniya Parikh, Jan Snigula | &#160;&#160;We analyse the stellar structure of a sample of dwarf ellipticals (dE)&#10;inhabiting various environments within the Virgo cluster. Integral&#45;field&#10;observations with a high spectral resolution allow us to robustly determine&#10;their low velocity dispersions ($sim25$ km s$^{&#45;1}$) and higher&#45;order&#10;kinematic moments out to the half&#45;light radius. We find the dEs exhibit a&#10;diversity in ages with the younger dEs being less enhanced than the older,&#10;suggesting a complex star formation history for those dEs that recently entered&#10;Virgo while others have been quenched shortly after reionization.&#10;Orbit&#45;superposition modeling allowed us to recover viewing angles, stellar&#10;mass&#45;to&#45;light ratios (with gradients), as well as the intrinsic orbit&#10;structure. We find that the angular momentum of the dEs is strongly suppressed&#10;compared to ordinary early&#45;type galaxies and correlates with the environment.&#10;Flattened dEs are so because of a suppressed kinetic energy perpendicular to&#10;their equatorial plane. Combining population and dynamical modeling results, we&#10;find an age&#45;dependent stellar initial mass function (IMF) or, alternatively,&#10;evidence for a more extended star formation history for those galaxies that&#10;have had higher initial mass and/or inhabited lower density environments. dEs&#10;appear to have a spatially homogeneous stellar structure but the state they&#10;were `frozen&#39; in as they stopped forming stars varies dramatically according to&#10;their initial conditions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10518v1) |&#10;| RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long&#45;Context LLM Inference via Vector&#10; &#160;Retrieval | Di Liu, Meng Chen, Baotong Lu, Huiqiang Jiang, Zhenhua Han, Qianxi Zhang, Qi Chen, Chengruidong Zhang, Bailu Ding, Kai Zhang, Chen Chen, Fan Yang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu | &#160;&#160;Transformer&#45;based large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly important&#10;in various domains. However, the quadratic time complexity of attention&#10;operation poses a significant challenge for scaling to longer contexts due to&#10;the extremely high inference latency and GPU memory consumption for caching&#10;key&#45;value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training&#45;free&#10;approach to accelerate attention computation. To leverage the dynamic sparse&#10;property of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor&#10;search (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most&#10;relevant ones via vector search during generation. Due to the&#10;out&#45;of&#45;distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors, off&#45;the&#45;shelf&#10;ANNS indexes still need to scan O(N) (usually 30% of all keys) data for&#10;accurate retrieval, which fails to exploit the high sparsity.&#10;RetrievalAttention first identifies the OOD challenge of ANNS&#45;based attention,&#10;and addresses it via an attention&#45;aware vector search algorithm that can adapt&#10;to queries and only access 1&#45;&#45;3% of data, thus achieving a sub&#45;linear time&#10;complexity. RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of&#10;long&#45;context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the&#10;model accuracy. Especially, RetrievalAttention only needs 16GB GPU memory for&#10;serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating&#10;one token in 0.188 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB).&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516v1) |&#10;| An Efficient Self&#45;Learning Framework For Interactive Spoken Dialog&#10; &#160;Systems | Hitesh Tulsiani, David M.

Unfortunately, traditional automatic speech&#10;recognition (ASR) systems deployed in such applications are usually trained to&#10;recognize each turn independently and lack the ability to adapt to the&#10;conversational context or incorporate user feedback. In this work, we introduce&#10;a general framework for ASR in dialog systems that can go beyond learning from&#10;single&#45;turn utterances and learn over time how to adapt to both explicit&#10;supervision and implicit user feedback present in multi&#45;turn conversations. We&#10;accomplish that by leveraging advances in student&#45;teacher learning and&#10;context&#45;aware dialog processing, and designing contrastive self&#45;supervision&#10;approaches with Ohm, a new online hard&#45;negative mining approach. We show that&#10;leveraging our new framework compared to traditional training leads to relative&#10;WER reductions of close to 10% in real&#45;world dialog systems, and up to 26% on&#10;public synthetic data.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10515v1) |&#10;| Constraints on axions from patchy screening of the cosmic microwave&#10; &#160;background | Samuel Goldstein, Fiona McCarthy, Cristina Mondino, J.

We cross&#45;correlate these maps with&#10;data from the $textit{unWISE}$ galaxy survey and find no evidence of axions.&#10;We constrain the axion&#45;photon coupling, $g_{agammagamma} &#10;esssim 2 times&#10;10^{&#45;12}~{&#13;m GeV}^{&#45;1}$, at the 95% confidence level for axion masses in the&#10;range $10^{&#45;13}~{&#13;m eV} &#10;esssim m_a &#10;esssim 10^{&#45;12}~{&#13;m eV}$. These&#10;constraints are competitive with the tightest astrophysical axion limits in&#10;this mass range and are inferred from robust population&#45;level statistics, which&#10;makes them complementary to existing searches that rely on modeling of&#10;individual systems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10514v1) |&#10;| Weak Superimposed Codes of Improved Asymptotic Rate and Their Randomized&#10; &#160;Construction | Yu Tsunoda, Yuichiro Fujiwara | &#160;&#160;Weak superimposed codes are combinatorial structures related closely to&#10;generalized cover&#45;free families, superimposed codes, and disjunct matrices in&#10;that they are only required to satisfy similar but less stringent conditions.&#10;This class of codes may also be seen as a stricter variant of what are known as&#10;locally thin families in combinatorics. Originally, weak superimposed codes&#10;were introduced in the context of multimedia content protection against illegal&#10;distribution of copies under the assumption that a coalition of malicious users&#10;may employ the averaging attack with adversarial noise. As in many other kinds&#10;of codes in information theory, it is of interest and importance in the study&#10;of weak superimposed codes to find the highest achievable rate in the&#10;asymptotic regime and give an efficient construction that produces an infinite&#10;sequence of codes that achieve it. Here, we prove a tighter lower bound than&#10;the sharpest known one on the rate of optimal weak superimposed codes and give&#10;a polynomial&#45;time randomized construction algorithm for codes that&#10;asymptotically attain our improved bound with high probability. Our&#10;probabilistic approach is versatile and applicable to many other related codes&#10;and arrays.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10511v1) |&#10;| Pennsieve &#45; A Collaborative Platform for Translational Neuroscience and&#10; &#160;Beyond | Zack Goldblum, Zhongchuan Xu, Haoer Shi, Patryk Orzechowski, Jamaal Spence, Kathryn A Davis, Brian Litt, Nishant Sinha, Joost Wagenaar | &#160;&#160;The exponential growth of neuroscientific data necessitates platforms that&#10;facilitate data management and multidisciplinary collaboration.

Pennsieve supports complex multimodal&#10;datasets and provides tools for data visualization and analyses. It takes a&#10;comprehensive approach to data integration, enabling researchers to define&#10;custom metadata schemas and utilize advanced tools to filter and query their&#10;data. Pennsieve&#39;s modular architecture allows external applications to extend&#10;its capabilities, and collaborative workspaces with peer&#45;reviewed data&#10;publishing mechanisms promote high&#45;quality datasets optimized for downstream&#10;analysis, both in the cloud and on&#45;premises.&#10; &#160;Pennsieve forms the core for major neuroscience research programs including&#10;the NIH SPARC Initiative, NIH HEAL Initiative&#39;s PRECISION Human Pain Network,&#10;and NIH HEAL RE&#45;JOIN Initiative. It serves more than 80 research groups&#10;worldwide, along with several large&#45;scale, inter&#45;institutional projects at&#10;clinical sites through the University of Pennsylvania. Underpinning the&#10;SPARC.Science, Epilepsy.Science, and Pennsieve Discover portals, Pennsieve&#10;stores over 125 TB of scientific data, with 35 TB of data publicly available&#10;across more than 350 high&#45;impact datasets.

Specifically, we investigate the role of resistivity&#10;in the dynamical evolution of neutron stars over a period of up to 100 ms and&#10;its effects on their quasi&#45;equilibrium configurations. Our results demonstrate&#10;that resistivity can significantly influence the development of&#10;magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, resulting in markedly different magnetic&#10;field geometries. Additionally, resistivity suppresses the growth of these&#10;instabilities, leading to a reduction in the amplitude of emitted gravitational&#10;waves. Despite the variations in magnetic field geometries, the ratio of&#10;poloidal to toroidal field energies remains consistently 9:1 throughout the&#10;simulations, for the models we investigated.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10508v1) |&#10;| Beth&#45;Uhlenbeck equation for the thermodynamics of fluctuations in a&#10; &#160;generalised 2+1D Gross&#45;Neveu model | Biplab Mahato, David Blaschke, Dietmar Ebert | &#160;&#160;We study a generalised version of Gross&#45;Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions. The&#10;model is inspired from graphene which shows a linear dispersion relation near&#10;the Dirac points. The phase structure and the thermodynamic properties in the&#10;mean field approximation have been studied before. Here we go beyond the mean&#10;field level by deriving a Beth&#45;Uhlenbeck equation for Gaussian fluctuations,&#10;solutions of which we explore numerically, for the first time including their&#10;momentum dependence. We discuss the excitonic mass, fluctuation pressure and&#10;phase shifts. We also perform a comparison with the NJL model in 3+1 dimension&#10;and discuss its implication for graphene.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10507v1) |&#10;| Context&#45;aware Code Segmentation for C&#45;to&#45;Rust Translation using Large&#10; &#160;Language Models | Momoko Shiraishi, Takahiro Shinagawa | &#160;&#160;There is strong motivation to translate C code into Rust code due to the&#10;continuing threat of memory safety vulnerabilities in existing C programs and&#10;the significant attention paid to Rust as an alternative to the C language.&#10;While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating this translation&#10;by generating more natural and safer code than rule&#45;based methods, previous&#10;studies have shown that LLM&#45;generated Rust code often fails to compile, even&#10;for relatively small C programs, due to significant differences between the two&#10;languages and context window limitations. We propose an LLM&#45;based translation&#10;scheme that improves the success rate of translating large&#45;scale C code into&#10;compilable Rust code. Our approach involves three key techniques: (1)&#10;pre&#45;processing the C code to better align its structure and expressions with&#10;Rust, (2) segmenting the code into optimally sized translation units to avoid&#10;exceeding the LLM&#39;s context window limits, and (3) iteratively compiling and&#10;repairing errors while maintaining consistency between translation units using&#10;context&#45;supplementing prompts. Compilation success is an essential first step&#10;in achieving functional equivalence, as only compilable code can be further&#10;tested. In experiments with 20 benchmark C programs, including those exceeding&#10;4 kilo lines of code, we successfully translated all programs into compilable&#10;Rust code without losing corresponding parts of the original code.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10506v1) |&#10;| Machine Learning Optimization of non&#45;Kasha Behavior and of Transient&#10; &#160;Dynamics in Model Retinal Isomerization | Davinder Singh, Chern Chuang, Paul Brumer | &#160;&#160;Designing a model of retinal isomerization in Rhodopsin, the first step in&#10;vision, that accounts for both experimental transient and stationary state&#10;observables is challenging. Here, multi&#45;objective Bayesian optimization is&#10;employed to refine the parameters of a minimal two&#45;state&#45;two&#45;mode (TM) model&#10;describing the photoisomerization of retinal in Rhodopsin. With an appropriate&#10;selection of objectives, the optimized retinal model predicts excitation&#10;wavelength&#45;dependent fluorescence spectra that closely align with&#10;experimentally observed non&#45;Kasha behavior in the non&#45;equilibrium steady state.&#10;Further, adjustments to the potential energy surface within the TM model reduce&#10;the discrepancies across the time domain. Overall, agreement with experimental&#10;data is excellent.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10505v1) |&#10;| DILA: Dictionary Label Attention for Mechanistic Interpretability in&#10; &#160;High&#45;dimensional Multi&#45;label Medical Coding Prediction | John Wu, David Wu, Jimeng Sun | &#160;&#160;Predicting high&#45;dimensional or extreme multilabels, such as in medical&#10;coding, requires both accuracy and interpretability. Existing works often rely&#10;on local interpretability methods, failing to provide comprehensive&#10;explanations of the overall mechanism behind each label prediction within a&#10;multilabel set. We propose a mechanistic interpretability module called&#10;DIctionary Label Attention (method) that disentangles uninterpretable dense&#10;embeddings into a sparse embedding space, where each nonzero element (a&#10;dictionary feature) represents a globally learned medical concept. Through&#10;human evaluations, we show that our sparse embeddings are more human&#10;understandable than its dense counterparts by at least 50 percent. Our&#10;automated dictionary feature identification pipeline, leveraging large language&#10;models (LLMs), uncovers thousands of learned medical concepts by examining and&#10;summarizing the highest activating tokens for each dictionary feature. We&#10;represent the relationships between dictionary features and medical codes&#10;through a sparse interpretable matrix, enhancing the mechanistic and global&#10;understanding of the model&#39;s predictions while maintaining competitive&#10;performance and scalability without extensive human annotation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10504v1) |&#10;| Causal Language Modeling Can Elicit Search and Reasoning Capabilities on&#10; &#160;Logic Puzzles | Kulin Shah, Nishanth Dikkala, Xin Wang, Rina Panigrahy | &#160;&#160;Causal language modeling using the Transformer architecture has yielded&#10;remarkable capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) over the last few&#10;years. However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning&#10;capabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this&#10;work, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as&#10;solving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to&#10;search over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then&#10;apply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the&#10;application of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in&#10;a cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases,&#10;multiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We&#10;observe that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn&#10;to solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21%$ of the puzzles fully correctly)&#10;when trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that&#10;training Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and&#10;without such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis&#10;to Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves&#10;$92.04 %$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal&#10;representations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear&#10;probing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any&#10;given cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine&#10;implicit in the Transformer weights.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10502v1) |&#10;| Alignment with nonlinear velocity couplings: collision&#45;avoidance and&#10; &#160;micro&#45;to&#45;macro mean&#45;field limits | Young&#45;Pil Choi, Michał Fabisiak, Jan Peszek | &#160;&#160;We investigate the pressureless fractional Euler&#45;alignment system with&#10;nonlinear velocity couplings, referred to as the $p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system.&#10;This model features a nonlinear velocity alignment force, interpreted as a&#10;density&#45;weighted fractional $p$&#45;Laplacian when the singularity parameter&#10;$alpha$ exceeds the spatial dimension $d$. Our primary goal is to establish&#10;the existence of solutions for strongly singular interactions ($alpha ge d$)&#10;and compactly supported initial conditions. We construct solutions as&#10;mean&#45;field limits of empirical measures from a kinetic variant of the&#10;$p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system. Specifically, we show that a sequence of empirical&#10;measures converges to a finite Radon measure, whose local density and velocity&#10;satisfy the $p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system. Our results are the first to prove the&#10;existence of solutions to this system in multi&#45;dimensional settings without&#10;significant initial data restrictions, covering both nonlinear ($p&gt;2$) and&#10;linear ($p=2$) cases. Additionally, we establish global existence, uniqueness,&#10;and collision avoidance for the corresponding particle ODE system under&#10;non&#45;collisional initial conditions, extending previous results for $1 &#10;e p &#10;e&#10;alpha + 2$. This analysis supports our mean&#45;field limit argument and&#10;contributes to understanding alignment models with singular communication.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10501v1) |&#10;| Focus diverse phase retrieval test results on broadband continuous&#10; &#160;wavefront sensing in space telescope applications | Hyukmo Kang, Kyle Van Gorkom, Meghdoot Biswas, Daewook Kim, Ewan S. Douglas | &#160;&#160;Continuous wavefront sensing benefits space observatories in on&#45;orbit optical&#10;performance maintenance. To measure the phase of a wavefront, phase retrieval&#10;is an attractive technique as it uses multiple point spread function (PSF)&#10;images that are acquired by the telescope itself without extra metrology&#10;systems nor complicated calibration. The focus diverse phase retrieval utilizes&#10;PSFs from predetermined defocused positions to enhance the dynamic range of the&#10;algorithm. We describe an updated visible light active optics testbed with the&#10;addition of a linear motorized focus stage. The performance of the phase&#10;retrieval algorithm in broadband is tested under various cases. While broadband&#10;pass filters have advantages in higher signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio (SNR), the&#10;performance of phase retrieval can be restricted due to blurred image caused by&#10;diffraction and increased computing cost. We used multiple bandpass filters (10&#10;nm, 88 nm, and 150 nm) and investigated effects of bandwidth on the accuracy&#10;and required image acquisition conditions such as SNR, reaching accuracies&#10;below 20 nm RMS wavefront error at the widest bandwidth. We also investigated&#10;the dynamic range of the phase retrieval algorithm depending on the bandwidth&#10;and required amount of defocus to expand dynamic range. Finally, we simulated&#10;the continuous wavefront sensing and correction loop with a range of&#10;statistically generated representative telescope disturbance time series to&#10;test for edge cases.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10500v1) |&#10;| The role of higher&#45;order terms in trapped&#45;ion quantum computing with&#10; &#160;magnetic gradient induced coupling | Sebastian Nagies, Kevin T. Geier, Javed Akram, Junichi Okamoto, Dimitris Badounas, Christof Wunderlich, Michael Johanning, Philipp Hauke | &#160;&#160;Trapped&#45;ion hardware based on the Magnetic Gradient Induced Coupling (MAGIC)&#10;scheme is emerging as a promising platform for quantum computing. Nevertheless,&#10;in this (as in any other) quantum&#45;computing platform, many technical questions&#10;still have to be resolved before large&#45;scale and error&#45;tolerant applications&#10;are possible. In this work, we present a thorough discussion of the&#10;contribution of higher&#45;order terms to the MAGIC setup, which can occur due to&#10;anharmonicities in the external potential of the ion crystal (e.g., through&#10;Coulomb repulsion) or through curvature of the applied magnetic field. These&#10;terms take the form of three&#45;spin couplings as well as diverse terms that&#10;couple spins to phonons. We find that most of these are negligible in realistic&#10;situations, with only two contributions that need careful attention. First,&#10;there are parasitic longitudinal fields whose strength increases with chain&#10;length, but which can easily be compensated by a microwave detuning. Second,&#10;anharmonicities of the Coulomb interaction can lead to well&#45;known two&#45;to&#45;one&#10;conversions of phonon excitations, which can be avoided if the phonons are&#10;ground&#45;state cooled. Our detailed analysis constitutes an important&#10;contribution on the way of making magnetic&#45;gradient trapped&#45;ion quantum&#10;technology fit for large&#45;scale applications, and it may inspire new ways to&#10;purposefully design interaction terms.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10498v1) |&#10;| MusicLIME: Explainable Multimodal Music Understanding | Theodoros Sotirou, Vassilis Lyberatos, Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Stamou | &#160;&#160;Multimodal models are critical for music understanding tasks, as they capture&#10;the complex interplay between audio and lyrics. However, as these models become&#10;more prevalent, the need for explainability grows&#45;understanding how these&#10;systems make decisions is vital for ensuring fairness, reducing bias, and&#10;fostering trust. In this paper, we introduce MusicLIME, a model&#45;agnostic&#10;feature importance explanation method designed for multimodal music models.&#10;Unlike traditional unimodal methods, which analyze each modality separately&#10;without considering the interaction between them, often leading to incomplete&#10;or misleading explanations, MusicLIME reveals how audio and lyrical features&#10;interact and contribute to predictions, providing a holistic view of the&#10;model&#39;s decision&#45;making. Additionally, we enhance local explanations by&#10;aggregating them into global explanations, giving users a broader perspective&#10;of model behavior.

Most current recommender systems provide&#10;recommendations using conventional methods such as collaborative or&#10;content&#45;based filtering. Diffusion is a new approach to generative AI that&#10;improves on previous generative AI approaches such as Variational Autoencoders&#10;(VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We incorporate diffusion in&#10;a recommender system that mirrors the sequence users take when browsing and&#10;rating items. Although a few current recommender systems incorporate diffusion,&#10;they do not incorporate classifier&#45;free guidance, a new innovation in diffusion&#10;models as a whole. In this paper, we present a diffusion recommender system&#10;that augments the underlying recommender system model for improved performance&#10;and also incorporates classifier&#45;free guidance. Our findings show improvements&#10;over state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art recommender systems for most metrics for several&#10;recommendation tasks on a variety of datasets.

We study the&#10;renormalizability of this theory in the framework of the Batalin&#45;Vilkovisky&#10;formalism, which allows for a gauge invariant renormalization. Using the&#10;background field method, we discuss the gauge invariance of the background&#10;effective action and analyze the Ward identities which reflect the symmetries&#10;of the EC theory.

Our approach is model independent and never requires the&#10;knowledge of $vert V_{cb}vert$. By studying such distributions in the case of&#10;light leptons, a comparison between results from different data sets from the&#10;Belle and BelleII Collaborations and between data and Standard Model&#10;calculations is also given for several interesting quantities.

This paper investigates the effectiveness of Large Language&#10;Models (LLMs) in identifying vulnerabilities within codebases, with a focus on&#10;the latest advancements in LLM technology. Through a comparative analysis, we&#10;assess the performance of emerging LLMs, specifically Llama, CodeLlama, Gemma,&#10;and CodeGemma, alongside established state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art models such as BERT,&#10;RoBERTa, and GPT&#45;3. Our study aims to shed light on the capabilities of LLMs in&#10;vulnerability detection, contributing to the enhancement of software security&#10;practices across diverse open&#45;source repositories.

Our paper aims to investigate if VLMs&#10;pre&#45;trained on web&#45;scale data learn to encode object states, which can be&#10;extracted with zero&#45;shot text prompts. We curate an object state recognition&#10;dataset ChangeIt&#45;Frames, and evaluate nine open&#45;source VLMs, including models&#10;trained with contrastive and generative objectives. We observe that while these&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art vision&#45;language models can reliably perform object&#10;recognition, they consistently fail to accurately distinguish the objects&#39;&#10;physical states. Through extensive experiments, we identify three areas for&#10;improvements for VLMs to better encode object states, namely the quality of&#10;object localization, the architecture to bind concepts to objects, and the&#10;objective to learn discriminative visual and language encoders on object&#10;states.

Ruan, Michael Eracleous, Daryl Haggard, Jessie C. Runnoe | &#160;&#160;The physical processes that produce X&#45;ray Quasi&#45;Periodic Eruptions (QPEs)&#10;recently discovered from the nuclei of several low&#45;redshift galaxies are&#10;mysterious. Several pieces of observational evidence strongly suggest a link&#10;between QPEs and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE). Previous studies also reveal&#10;that the morphologies of TDE host galaxies are highly concentrated, with high&#10;Sersic indicies, bulge&#45;to&#45;total light (B/T) ratios, and stellar surface mass&#10;densities relative to the broader galaxy population. We use these distinctive&#10;properties to test the link between QPEs and TDEs, by comparing these&#10;parameters of QPE host galaxies to TDE host galaxies. We employ archival Legacy&#10;Survey images of a sample of 9 QPE host galaxies and a sample of 13 TDE host&#10;galaxies, and model their surface brightness profiles. We show that QPE host&#10;galaxies have high Sersic indices of ~3, high B/T ratios of ~0.5, and high&#10;surface mass densities of ~10^10 Msun kpc^&#45;2. These properties are similar to&#10;TDE host galaxies, but are in strong contrast to a mass&#45; and redshift&#45;matched&#10;control sample of galaxies. We also find tentative evidence that the central&#10;black holes in both QPE and TDE host galaxies are undermassive relative to&#10;their stellar mass. The morphological similarities between QPE and TDE host&#10;galaxies at the population level add to the mounting evidence of a physical&#10;link between these phenomena, and favor QPE models that also invoke TDEs.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10486v1) |&#10;| Tuning the Rate of Tightly Packed Systems To Produce Planet Occurrence&#10; &#160;Trends with Galactic Height | Sarah Ballard | &#160;&#160;The formation of planetary systems has historically been considered in&#10;isolation, decoupled from processes on galactic scales. Recent findings&#10;employing data from ESA&#39;s Gaia mission challenge this narrative, identifying&#10;trends in planet occurrence with galactic kinematics and stellar age. The&#10;findings indicate changes in planet occurrence over and above the predicted&#10;changes from metallicity variation within the Milky Way, so that changes to&#10;stellar metallicity alone (long understood to be deterministic in planet&#10;outcomes) cannot explain the trends entirely. The scope of potential factors&#10;influencing planet formation has grown progressively wider, with accompanying&#10;theoretical support for galactic&#45;scale influences upon planet formation. In&#10;this manuscript, we investigate specifically how changes to the rate of Systems&#10;of Tightly&#45;packed Inner Planets (STIPs) could manifest as a trend in planet&#10;occurrence with galactic height. We focus our study upon M dwarf planetary&#10;systems for two reasons: first, they host STIPs at high rates, and secondly,&#10;their longevity makes them useful probes for kinematic trends over Gyr. We&#10;consider two models for a varying STIP rate: one in which STIP likelihood is&#10;determined by stellar age alone, irrespective of galactic time, and another in&#10;which the STIP likelihood suddenly increased in recent galactic history. Both&#10;models, which impose a higher STIP likelihood among younger stars, produce a&#10;negative gradient in planet occurrence with increasing height from the galactic&#10;midplane. We find that a step function model in which STIP likelihood increased&#10;by a factor of several ~a few Gyr ago resembles an observed trend among FGK&#10;dwarfs. We consider plausible physical mechanisms that could mimic the&#10;hypothesized model, given known links between STIP occurrence and other stellar&#10;and planetary properties.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10485v1) |&#10;| XLM for Autonomous Driving Systems: A Comprehensive Review | Sonda Fourati, Wael Jaafar, Noura Baccar, Safwan Alfattani | &#160;&#160;Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable proficiency in various&#10;information&#45;processing tasks. These tasks span from extracting data and&#10;summarizing literature to generating content, predictive modeling,&#10;decision&#45;making, and system controls. Moreover, Vision Large Models (VLMs) and&#10;Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which represent the next generation of language&#10;models, a.k.a., XLMs, can combine and integrate many data modalities with the&#10;strength of language understanding, thus advancing several information&#45;based&#10;systems, such as Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). Indeed, by combining&#10;language communication with multimodal sensory inputs, e.g., panoramic images&#10;and LiDAR or radar data, accurate driving actions can be taken. In this&#10;context, we provide in this survey paper a comprehensive overview of the&#10;potential of XLMs towards achieving autonomous driving. Specifically, we review&#10;the relevant literature on ADS and XLMs, including their architectures, tools,&#10;and frameworks. Then, we detail the proposed approaches to deploy XLMs for&#10;autonomous driving solutions. Finally, we provide the related challenges to XLM&#10;deployment for ADS and point to future research directions aiming to enable XLM&#10;adoption in future ADS frameworks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10484v1) |&#10;| Efficient polarizable QM/MM using the direct reaction field Hamiltonian&#10; &#160;with electrostatic potential fitted multipole operators | Thomas P. Fay, Nicolas Ferré, Miquel Huix&#45;Rotllant | &#160;&#160;Electronic polarization and dispersion are decisive actors in determining&#10;interaction energies between molecules. These interactions have a particularly&#10;profound effect on excitation energies of molecules in complex environments,&#10;especially when the excitation involves a significant degree of charge&#10;reorganisation. The direct reaction field (DRF) approach, which has seen a&#10;recent revival of interest, provides a powerful framework for describing these&#10;interactions in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models of&#10;systems, where a small subsystem of interest is described using quantum&#10;chemical methods and the remainder is treated with a simple MM force field. In&#10;this paper we show how the DRF approach can be combined with the electrostatic&#10;potential fitted (ESPF) multipole operator description of the QM region charge&#10;density, which reduces the scaling $mathcal{O}(N_mathrm{MM}^3)$ of the method&#10;with MM system to $mathcal{O}(N_mathrm{MM}^2)$. We also show how the DRF&#10;approach can be combined with fluctuating charge descriptions of the&#10;polarizable environment, as well as previously used atom&#45;centred&#10;dipole&#45;polarizability based models. We further show that the ESPF&#45;DRF method&#10;provides an accurate description of molecular interactions in both ground and&#10;excited electronic states of the QM system and apply it to predict the gas to&#10;aqueous solution solvatochromic shifts in the UV/visible absorption spectrum of&#10;acrolein.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10483v1) |&#10;| Schrodinger&#39;s Memory: Large Language Models | Wei Wang, Qing Li | &#160;&#160;Memory is the foundation of LLMs&#39; functionality, yet past research has lacked&#10;an in&#45;depth exploration of their memory capabilities and underlying theory. In&#10;this paper, we apply UAT theory to explain the memory mechanism of LLMs and&#10;propose a new approach for evaluating LLM performance by comparing the memory&#10;capacities of different models. Through extensive experiments, we validate our&#10;theory and the memory abilities of LLMs. Finally, we compare the capabilities&#10;of the human brain and LLMs, highlighting both their similarities and&#10;differences in terms of working mechanisms.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10482v1) |&#10;| Exploring 3D Face Reconstruction and Fusion Methods for Face&#10; &#160;Verification: A Case&#45;Study in Video Surveillance | Simone Maurizio La Cava, Sara Concas, Ruben Tolosana, Roberto Casula, Giulia Orrù, Martin Drahansky, Julian Fierrez, Gian Luca Marcialis | &#160;&#160;3D face reconstruction (3DFR) algorithms are based on specific assumptions&#10;tailored to distinct application scenarios. These assumptions limit their use&#10;when acquisition conditions, such as the subject&#39;s distance from the camera or&#10;the camera&#39;s characteristics, are different than expected, as typically happens&#10;in video surveillance. Additionally, 3DFR algorithms follow various strategies&#10;to address the reconstruction of a 3D shape from 2D data, such as statistical&#10;model fitting, photometric stereo, or deep learning. In the present study, we&#10;explore the application of three 3DFR algorithms representative of the SOTA,&#10;employing each one as the template set generator for a face verification&#10;system. The scores provided by each system are combined by score&#45;level fusion.&#10;We show that the complementarity induced by different 3DFR algorithms improves&#10;performance when tests are conducted at never&#45;seen&#45;before distances from the&#10;camera and camera characteristics (cross&#45;distance and cross&#45;camera settings),&#10;thus encouraging further investigations on multiple 3DFR&#45;based approaches.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10481v1) |&#10;| Addressing misspecification in contextual optimization | Omar Bennouna, Jiawei Zhang, Saurabh Amin, Asuman Ozdaglar | &#160;&#160;We study a linear contextual optimization problem where a decision maker has&#10;access to historical data and contextual features to learn a cost prediction&#10;model aimed at minimizing decision error. We adopt the predict&#45;then&#45;optimize&#10;framework for this analysis. Given that perfect model alignment with reality is&#10;often unrealistic in practice, we focus on scenarios where the chosen&#10;hypothesis set is misspecified. In this context, it remains unclear whether&#10;current contextual optimization approaches can effectively address such model&#10;misspecification. In this paper, we present a novel integrated learning and&#10;optimization approach designed to tackle model misspecification in contextual&#10;optimization. This approach offers theoretical generalizability, tractability,&#10;and optimality guarantees, along with strong practical performance. Our method&#10;involves minimizing a tractable surrogate loss that aligns with the performance&#10;value from cost vector predictions, regardless of whether the model&#10;misspecified or not, and can be optimized in reasonable time. To our knowledge,&#10;no previous work has provided an approach with such guarantees in the context&#10;of model misspecification.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10479v1) |&#10;| Local SGD for Near&#45;Quadratic Problems: Improving Convergence under&#10; &#160;Unconstrained Noise Conditions | Andrey Sadchikov, Savelii Chezhegov, Aleksandr Beznosikov, Alexander Gasnikov | &#160;&#160;Distributed optimization plays an important role in modern large&#45;scale&#10;machine learning and data processing systems by optimizing the utilization of&#10;computational resources. One of the classical and popular approaches is Local&#10;Stochastic Gradient Descent (Local SGD), characterized by multiple local&#10;updates before averaging, which is particularly useful in distributed&#10;environments to reduce communication bottlenecks and improve scalability. A&#10;typical feature of this method is the dependence on the frequency of&#10;communications. But in the case of a quadratic target function with homogeneous&#10;data distribution over all devices, the influence of frequency of&#10;communications vanishes. As a natural consequence, subsequent studies include&#10;the assumption of a Lipschitz Hessian, as this indicates the similarity of the&#10;optimized function to a quadratic one to some extent. However, in order to&#10;extend the completeness of the Local SGD theory and unlock its potential, in&#10;this paper we abandon the Lipschitz Hessian assumption by introducing a new&#10;concept of $textit{approximate quadraticity}$. This assumption gives a new&#10;perspective on problems that have near quadratic properties. In addition,&#10;existing theoretical analyses of Local SGD often assume bounded variance. We,&#10;in turn, consider the unbounded noise condition, which allows us to broaden the&#10;class of studied problems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10478v1) |&#10;| SimInversion: A Simple Framework for Inversion&#45;Based Text&#45;to&#45;Image&#10; &#160;Editing | Qi Qian, Haiyang Xu, Ming Yan, Juhua Hu | &#160;&#160;Diffusion models demonstrate impressive image generation performance with&#10;text guidance. Inspired by the learning process of diffusion, existing images&#10;can be edited according to text by DDIM inversion. However, the vanilla DDIM&#10;inversion is not optimized for classifier&#45;free guidance and the accumulated&#10;error will result in the undesired performance. While many algorithms are&#10;developed to improve the framework of DDIM inversion for editing, in this work,&#10;we investigate the approximation error in DDIM inversion and propose to&#10;disentangle the guidance scale for the source and target branches to reduce the&#10;error while keeping the original framework. Moreover, a better guidance scale&#10;(i.e., 0.5) than default settings can be derived theoretically. Experiments on&#10;PIE&#45;Bench show that our proposal can improve the performance of DDIM inversion&#10;dramatically without sacrificing efficiency.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10476v1) |&#10;| Leadership and Engagement Dynamics in Legislative Twitter Networks:&#10; &#160;Statistical Analysis and Modeling | Carolina Luque, Juan Sosa | &#160;&#160;In this manuscript, we analyze the interaction network on Twitter among&#10;members of the 117th U.S. Congress to assess the visibility of political&#10;leaders and explore how systemic properties and node attributes influence the&#10;formation of legislative connections. We employ descriptive social network&#10;statistical methods, the exponential random graph model (ERGM), and the&#10;stochastic block model (SBM) to evaluate the relative impact of network&#10;systemic properties, as well as institutional and personal traits, on the&#10;generation of online relationships among legislators. Our findings reveal that&#10;legislative networks on social media platforms like Twitter tend to reinforce&#10;the leadership of dominant political actors rather than diminishing their&#10;influence. However, we identify that these leadership roles can manifest in&#10;various forms. Additionally, we highlight that online connections within&#10;legislative networks are influenced by both the systemic properties of the&#10;network and institutional characteristics.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10475v1) |&#10;| MacDiff: Unified Skeleton Modeling with Masked Conditional Diffusion | Lehong Wu, Lilang Lin, Jiahang Zhang, Yiyang Ma, Jiaying Liu | &#160;&#160;Self&#45;supervised learning has proved effective for skeleton&#45;based human action&#10;understanding. However, previous works either rely on contrastive learning that&#10;suffers false negative problems or are based on reconstruction that learns too&#10;much unessential low&#45;level clues, leading to limited representations for&#10;downstream tasks. Recently, great advances have been made in generative&#10;learning, which is naturally a challenging yet meaningful pretext task to model&#10;the general underlying data distributions. However, the representation learning&#10;capacity of generative models is under&#45;explored, especially for the skeletons&#10;with spacial sparsity and temporal redundancy. To this end, we propose Masked&#10;Conditional Diffusion (MacDiff) as a unified framework for human skeleton&#10;modeling. For the first time, we leverage diffusion models as effective&#10;skeleton representation learners. Specifically, we train a diffusion decoder&#10;conditioned on the representations extracted by a semantic encoder. Random&#10;masking is applied to encoder inputs to introduce a information bottleneck and&#10;remove redundancy of skeletons. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that&#10;our generative objective involves the contrastive learning objective which&#10;aligns the masked and noisy views. Meanwhile, it also enforces the&#10;representation to complement for the noisy view, leading to better&#10;generalization performance. MacDiff achieves state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art performance on&#10;representation learning benchmarks while maintaining the competence for&#10;generative tasks. Moreover, we leverage the diffusion model for data&#10;augmentation, significantly enhancing the fine&#45;tuning performance in scenarios&#10;with scarce labeled data.

Hassan | &#160;&#160;The proliferation of open Pre&#45;trained Language Models (PTLMs) on model&#10;registry platforms like Hugging Face (HF) presents both opportunities and&#10;challenges for companies building products around them. Similar to traditional&#10;software dependencies, PTLMs continue to evolve after a release. However, the&#10;current state of release practices of PTLMs on model registry platforms are&#10;plagued by a variety of inconsistencies, such as ambiguous naming conventions&#10;and inaccessible model training documentation. Given the knowledge gap on&#10;current PTLM release practices, our empirical study uses a mixed&#45;methods&#10;approach to analyze the releases of 52,227 PTLMs on the most well&#45;known model&#10;registry, HF. Our results reveal 148 different naming practices for PTLM&#10;releases, with 40.87% of changes to model weight files not represented in the&#10;adopted name&#45;based versioning practice or their documentation. In addition, we&#10;identified that the 52,227 PTLMs are derived from only 299 different base&#10;models (the modified original models used to create 52,227 PTLMs), with&#10;Fine&#45;tuning and Quantization being the most prevalent modification methods&#10;applied to these base models. Significant gaps in release transparency, in&#10;terms of training dataset specifications and model card availability, still&#10;exist, highlighting the need for standardized documentation. While we&#10;identified a model naming practice explicitly differentiating between major and&#10;minor PTLM releases, we did not find any significant difference in the types of&#10;changes that went into either type of releases, suggesting that major/minor&#10;version numbers for PTLMs often are chosen arbitrarily. Our findings provide&#10;valuable insights to improve PTLM release practices, nudging the field towards&#10;more formal semantic versioning practices.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10472v1) |&#10;| Real&#45;Time Whole&#45;Body Control of Legged Robots with Model&#45;Predictive Path&#10; &#160;Integral Control | Juan Alvarez&#45;Padilla, John Z.

F. Lizarraga, Flavia M. D. Marquitti, Marcus A. M. de Aguiar | &#160;&#160;We investigate the role of assortative mating in speciation using the&#10;sympatric model of Derrida and Higgs. The model explores the idea that genetic&#10;differences create incompatibilities between individuals, preventing mating if&#10;the number of such differences is too large. Speciation, however, only happens&#10;in this mating system if the number of genes is large. Here we show that&#10;speciation with small genome sizes can occur if assortative mating is&#10;introduced. In our model individuals are represented by three chromosomes: one&#10;responsible for reproductive compatibility, one for coding the trait on which&#10;assortativity will operate, and a neutral chromosome. Reproduction is possible&#10;if individuals are genetically similar with respect to the first chromosome,&#10;but among these compatible mating partners, the one with the most similar trait&#10;coded by the second chromosome is selected. We show that this type of&#10;assortativity facilitates speciation, which can happen with a small number of&#10;genes in the first chromosome. Species, classified according to reproductive&#10;isolation, dictated by the first chromosome, can display different traits&#10;values, as measured by the second and the third chromosomes. Therefore, species&#10;can also be identified based on similarity of the neutral trait, which works as&#10;a proxy for reproductive isolation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10466v1) |&#10;| A stabilized total pressure&#45;formulation of the Biot&#39;s poroelasticity&#10; &#160;equations in frequency domain: numerical analysis and applications | Cristian Cárcamo, Alfonso Caiazzo, Felipe Galarce, Joaquín Mura | &#160;&#160;This work focuses on the numerical solution of the dynamics of a poroelastic&#10;material in the frequency domain. We provide a detailed stability analysis&#10;based on the application of the Fredholm alternative in the continuous case,&#10;considering a total pressure formulation of the Biot&#39;s equations. In the&#10;discrete setting, we propose a stabilized equal order finite element method&#10;complemented by an additional pressure stabilization to enhance the robustness&#10;of the numerical scheme with respect to the fluid permeability. Utilizing the&#10;Fredholm alternative, we extend the well&#45;posedness results to the discrete&#10;setting, obtaining theoretical optimal convergence for the case of linear&#10;finite elements. We present different numerical experiments to validate the&#10;proposed method. First, we consider model problems with known analytic&#10;solutions in two and three dimensions. As next, we show that the method is&#10;robust for a wide range of permeabilities, including the case of discontinuous&#10;coefficients. Lastly, we show the application for the simulation of brain&#10;elastography on a realistic brain geometry obtained from medical imaging.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10465v1) |&#10;| New Direct Sum Tests | Alek Westover, Edward Yu, Kai Zheng | &#160;&#160;A function $f:[n]^{d} to mathbb{F}_2$ is a defn{direct sum} if there are&#10;functions $L_i:[n]to mathbb{F}_2$ such that ${f(x) = sum_{i}L_i(x_i)}$. In&#10;this work we give multiple results related to the property testing of direct&#10;sums.&#10; &#160;Our first result concerns a test proposed by Dinur and Golubev in 2019. We&#10;call their test the Diamond test and show that it is indeed a direct sum&#10;tester. More specifically, we show that if a function $f$ is $epsilon$&#45;far&#10;from being a direct sum function, then the Diamond test rejects $f$ with&#10;probability at least $Omega_{n,epsilon}(1)$. Even in the case of $n = 2$, the&#10;Diamond test is, to the best of our knowledge, novel and yields a new tester&#10;for the classic property of affinity.&#10; &#160;Apart from the Diamond test, we also analyze a broad family of direct sum&#10;tests, which at a high level, run an arbitrary affinity test on the restriction&#10;of $f$ to a random hypercube inside of $[n]^d$. This family of tests includes&#10;the direct sum test analyzed in cite{di19}, but does not include the Diamond&#10;test. As an application of our result, we obtain a direct sum test which works&#10;in the online adversary model of cite{KRV}.&#10; &#160;Finally, we also discuss a Fourier analytic interpretation of the diamond&#10;tester in the $n=2$ case, as well as prove local correction results for direct&#10;sum as conjectured by Dinur and Golubev.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10464v1) |&#10;| Kolmogorov&#45;Arnold Networks in Low&#45;Data Regimes: A Comparative Study with&#10; &#160;Multilayer Perceptrons | Farhad Pourkamali&#45;Anaraki | &#160;&#160;Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) have long been a cornerstone in deep learning,&#10;known for their capacity to model complex relationships. Recently,&#10;Kolmogorov&#45;Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a compelling alternative,&#10;utilizing highly flexible learnable activation functions directly on network&#10;edges, a departure from the neuron&#45;centric approach of MLPs. However, KANs&#10;significantly increase the number of learnable parameters, raising concerns&#10;about their effectiveness in data&#45;scarce environments. This paper presents a&#10;comprehensive comparative study of MLPs and KANs from both algorithmic and&#10;experimental perspectives, with a focus on low&#45;data regimes. We introduce an&#10;effective technique for designing MLPs with unique, parameterized activation&#10;functions for each neuron, enabling a more balanced comparison with KANs. Using&#10;empirical evaluations on simulated data and two real&#45;world data sets from&#10;medicine and engineering, we explore the trade&#45;offs between model complexity&#10;and accuracy, with particular attention to the role of network depth. Our&#10;findings show that MLPs with individualized activation functions achieve&#10;significantly higher predictive accuracy with only a modest increase in&#10;parameters, especially when the sample size is limited to around one hundred.&#10;For example, in a three&#45;class classification problem within additive&#10;manufacturing, MLPs achieve a median accuracy of 0.91, significantly&#10;outperforming KANs, which only reach a median accuracy of 0.53 with default&#10;hyperparameters. These results offer valuable insights into the impact of&#10;activation function selection in neural networks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10463v1) |&#10;| Effects of synapse location, delay and background stochastic activity on&#10; &#160;synchronising hippocampal CA1 neurons | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore | &#160;&#160;We study the synchronisation of neurons in a realistic model under the&#10;Hodgkin&#45;Huxley dynamics. To focus on the role of the different locations of the&#10;excitatory synapses, we use two identical neurons where the set of input&#10;signals is grouped at two different distances from the soma. The system is&#10;intended to represent a CA1 hippocampal neuron in which the synapses arriving&#10;from the CA3 neurons of the trisynaptic pathway appear to be localised in the&#10;apical dendritic region and are, in principle, either proximal or distal to the&#10;soma. Synchronisation is studied using a specifically defined spiking&#10;correlation function as a function of various parameters such as the distance&#10;from the soma of one of the synaptic groups, the inhibition weight and the&#10;associated activation delay. We found that the neurons&#39; spiking activity&#10;depends nonmonotonically on the relative dendritic location of the synapses and&#10;their inhibitory weight, whereas the synchronisation measure always decreases&#10;with inhibition, and strongly depends on its activation time delay. The&#10;background activity on the somas results essentially independent on the&#10;fluctuation intensity and strongly support the importance of the balance&#10;between inhibition and excitation for neuronal synchronization.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10460v1) |&#10;| Efficiently Crowdsourcing Visual Importance with Punch&#45;Hole Annotation | Minsuk Chang, Soohyun Lee, Aeri Cho, Hyeon Jeon, Seokhyeon Park, Cindy Xiong Bearfield, Jinwook Seo | &#160;&#160;We introduce a novel crowdsourcing method for identifying important areas in&#10;graphical images through punch&#45;hole labeling. Traditional methods, such as gaze&#10;trackers and mouse&#45;based annotations, which generate continuous data, can be&#10;impractical in crowdsourcing scenarios. They require many participants, and the&#10;outcome data can be noisy. In contrast, our method first segments the graphical&#10;image with a grid and drops a portion of the patches (punch holes). Then, we&#10;iteratively ask the labeler to validate each annotation with holes, narrowing&#10;down the annotation only having the most important area. This approach aims to&#10;reduce annotation noise in crowdsourcing by standardizing the annotations while&#10;enhancing labeling efficiency and reliability. Preliminary findings from&#10;fundamental charts demonstrate that punch&#45;hole labeling can effectively&#10;pinpoint critical regions. This also highlights its potential for broader&#10;application in visualization research, particularly in studying large&#45;scale&#10;users&#39; graphical perception. Our future work aims to enhance the algorithm to&#10;achieve faster labeling speed and prove its utility through large&#45;scale&#10;experiments.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10459v1) |&#10;| Full distribution of local observables in an exactly solvable current&#10; &#160;carrying steady states of a driven XXZ chain | Sandipan Manna, G J Sreejith | &#160;&#160;Current carrying steady states of interacting spins chains exhibit rich&#10;structures generated through an interplay of current induced correlations and&#10;energetic constraints from the Hamiltonian. The XXZ spin chain when coupled to&#10;maximally polarizing Lindblad terms admits an exact solution in a matrix&#10;product state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations&#10;and distributions of simple local spin observables in the non equilibrium&#10;steady state (NESS). We present exact expressions for spin correlators, entropy&#10;per site, cumulant generating functions for distributions of local observables&#10;in the XX limit (Ising anisotropy $Delta=0$). Further, we use the exact MPS&#10;solution in systems with $Delta&gt;0$, to numerically exactly calculate the&#10;entropy, correlations, as well as distributions of spin observables in blocks&#10;as large as $nsim 200$ sites allowing an estimation of the rate functions. The&#10;$z$ magnetization distribution is consistant with short range spin correlations&#10;in the $z$ direction while the $x$&#45;magnetization shows a double peak structure&#10;at larger $Delta$ suggesting short range ferromagnetic ordering. We find that&#10;the distribution of $z$&#45;magnetization sharpens for parameters where the current&#10;is maximized.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10458v1) |&#10;| Mean Residual Life Ageing Intensity Function | Ashutosh Singh, Ishapathik Das, Asok Kumar Nanda, Sumen Sen | &#160;&#160;The ageing intensity function is a powerful analytical tool that provides&#10;valuable insights into the ageing process across diverse domains such as&#10;reliability engineering, actuarial science, and healthcare. Its applications&#10;continue to expand as researchers delve deeper into understanding the complex&#10;dynamics of ageing and its implications for society. One common approach to&#10;defining the ageing intensity function is through the hazard rate or failure&#10;rate function, extensively explored in scholarly literature.

Additionally, we scrutinize the closure properties of the MRLAI&#10;function across different reliability operations. Furthermore, a new order&#10;termed the mean residual life ageing intensity order is defined to analyze the&#10;ageing behaviour of a system, and the closure property of this order under&#10;various reliability operations is discussed.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10456v1) |&#10;| Quantile Fourier regressions for decision making under uncertainty | Arash Khojaste, Geoffrey Pritchard, Golbon Zakeri | &#160;&#160;Weconsider Markov decision processes arising from a Markov model of an&#10;underlying natural phenomenon.

We have applied similar methods used to develop the&#10;recently released NEO model generator (NEOMOD), once debiasing the NEO&#10;population using data from Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) G96 telescope. ATLAS is&#10;composed of four different telescopes. We first analyzed observational data&#10;from each of all four telescopes separately and later combined them. Our&#10;results highlight main differences between CSS and ATLAS, e.g., sky coverage&#10;and survey power at debiasing the NEO population. ATLAS has a much larger sky&#10;coverage than CSS, allowing it to find bright NEOs that would be constantly&#10;&quot;hiding&quot; from CSS. Consequently, ATLAS is more powerful than CSS at debiasing&#10;the NEO population for H $&#10;esssim$ 19. With its intrinsically greater&#10;sensitivity and emphasis on observing near opposition, CSS excels in the&#10;debiasing of smaller objects. ATLAS, as an all sky survey designed to find&#10;imminent hazardous objects, necessarily spends a significant fraction of time&#10;looking at places on the sky where objects do not appear, reducing its power&#10;for debiasing the population of small objects. We estimate a NEO population&#10;completeness of $approx$ 88%$^{+3%}_{&#45;2%}$ for H $&lt;$ 17.75 and $approx$&#10;36%$^{+1%}_{&#45;1%}$ for H $&lt;$ 22.25. Those numbers are similar to previous&#10;estimates (within error bars for H $&lt;$ 17.75) from CSS, yet, around 3% and 8%&#10;smaller at their face values, respectively. We also confirm previous finding&#10;that the $&#10;u_6$ secular resonance is the main source of small and faint NEOs&#10;at H = 28, whereas the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter dominates for&#10;larger and brighter NEOs at H = 15.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10453v1) |&#10;| Signed Graph Autoencoder for Explainable and Polarization&#45;Aware Network&#10; &#160;Embeddings | Nikolaos Nakis, Chrysoula Kosma, Giannis Nikolentzos, Michalis Chatzianastasis, Iakovos Evdaimon, Michalis Vazirgiannis | &#160;&#160;Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant&#10;attention in recent years for their ability to extract informative latent&#10;representations, characterizing the structure of complex topologies, such as&#10;graphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited&#10;focus on developing and evaluating explainable neural&#45;based graph generative&#10;models specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we&#10;propose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE&#10;extracts node&#45;level representations that express node memberships over distinct&#10;extreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is&#10;achieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its&#10;polarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for&#10;analyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with&#10;relational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation&#10;demonstrates the SGAAEs&#39; capability to successfully infer node memberships over&#10;the different underlying latent structures while extracting competing&#10;communities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the&#10;network. Additionally, we introduce the 2&#45;level network polarization problem&#10;and show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model&#10;achieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across&#10;four real&#45;world datasets, outperforming several baseline models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10452v1) |&#10;| Why you should also use OLS estimation of tail exponents | Thiago Trafane Oliveira Santos, Daniel Oliveira Cajueiro | &#160;&#160;Even though practitioners often estimate Pareto exponents running OLS&#10;rank&#45;size regressions, the usual recommendation is to use the Hill MLE with a&#10;small&#45;sample correction instead, due to its unbiasedness and efficiency. In&#10;this paper, we advocate that you should also apply OLS in empirical&#10;applications. On the one hand, we demonstrate that, with a small&#45;sample&#10;correction, the OLS estimator is also unbiased. On the other hand, we show that&#10;the MLE assigns significantly greater weight to smaller observations. This&#10;suggests that the OLS estimator may outperform the MLE in cases where the&#10;distribution is (i) strictly Pareto but only in the upper tail or (ii)&#10;regularly varying rather than strictly Pareto. We substantiate our theoretical&#10;findings with Monte Carlo simulations and real&#45;world applications,&#10;demonstrating the practical relevance of the OLS method in estimating tail&#10;exponents.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10448v1) |&#10;| Hydrodynamic hovering of swimming bacteria above surfaces | Pyae Hein Htet, Debasish Das, Eric Lauga | &#160;&#160;Flagellated bacteria are hydrodynamically attracted to rigid walls, yet past&#10;work shows a &#39;hovering&#39; state where they swim stably at a finite height above&#10;surfaces. We use numerics and theory to reveal the physical origin of hovering.&#10;Simulations first show that hovering requires an elongated cell body and&#10;results from a tilt away from the wall. Theoretical models then identify two&#10;essential asymmetries: the response of width&#45;asymmetric cells to active flows&#10;created by length&#45;asymmetric cells. A minimal model reconciles near and&#10;far&#45;field hydrodynamics, capturing all key features of hovering.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10447v1) |&#10;| KoroT&#45;3E: A Personalized Musical Mnemonics Tool for Enhancing Memory&#10; &#160;Retention of Complex Computer Science Concepts | Xiangzhe Yuan, Jiajun Wang, Siying Hu, Andrew Cheung, Zhicong Lu | &#160;&#160;As the demand for computer science (CS) skills grows, mastering foundational&#10;concepts is crucial yet challenging for novice learners. To address this&#10;challenge, we present KoroT&#45;3E, an AI&#45;based system that creates personalized&#10;musical mnemonics to enhance both memory retention and understanding of&#10;concepts in CS. KoroT&#45;3E enables users to transform complex concepts into&#10;memorable lyrics and compose melodies that suit their musical preferences. We&#10;conducted semi&#45;structured interviews (n=12) to investigate why novice learners&#10;find it challenging to memorize and understand CS concepts. The findings,&#10;combined with constructivist learning theory, established our initial design,&#10;which was then refined following consultations with CS education experts. An&#10;empirical experiment(n=36) showed that those using KoroT&#45;3E (n=18)&#10;significantly outperformed the control group (n=18), with improved memory&#10;efficiency, increased motivation, and a positive learning experience. These&#10;findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating multimodal generative AI&#10;into CS education to create personalized and interactive learning experiences.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10446v1) |&#10;| Deep&#45;Wide Learning Assistance for Insect Pest Classification | Toan Nguyen, Huy Nguyen, Huy Ung, Hieu Ung, Binh Nguyen | &#160;&#160;Accurate insect pest recognition plays a critical role in agriculture. It is&#10;a challenging problem due to the intricate characteristics of insects. In this&#10;paper, we present DeWi, novel learning assistance for insect pest&#10;classification. With a one&#45;stage and alternating training strategy, DeWi&#10;simultaneously improves several Convolutional Neural Networks in two&#10;perspectives: discrimination (by optimizing a triplet margin loss in a&#10;supervised training manner) and generalization (via data augmentation). From&#10;that, DeWi can learn discriminative and in&#45;depth features of insect pests&#10;(deep) yet still generalize well to a large number of insect categories (wide).&#10;Experimental results show that DeWi achieves the highest performances on two&#10;insect pest classification benchmarks (76.44% accuracy on the IP102 dataset&#10;and 99.79% accuracy on the D0 dataset, respectively). In addition, extensive&#10;evaluations and ablation studies are conducted to thoroughly investigate our&#10;DeWi and demonstrate its superiority.

Behavior trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robot&#10;task planning for their modularity and flexibility, but manually designing them&#10;can be effort&#45;intensive. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been&#10;applied in robotic task planning for generating action sequences, but their&#10;ability to generate BTs has not been fully investigated. To this end, We&#10;propose LLM as BT&#45;planner, a novel framework to leverage LLMs for BT generation&#10;in robotic assembly task planning and execution. Four in&#45;context learning&#10;methods are introduced to utilize the natural language processing and inference&#10;capabilities of LLMs to produce task plans in BT format, reducing manual effort&#10;and ensuring robustness and comprehensibility. We also evaluate the performance&#10;of fine&#45;tuned, fewer&#45;parameter LLMs on the same tasks. Experiments in simulated&#10;and real&#45;world settings show that our framework enhances LLMs&#39; performance in&#10;BT generation, improving success rates in BT generation through in&#45;context&#10;learning and supervised fine&#45;tuning.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10444v1) |&#10;| The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration. II.&#10; &#160;Mid&#45;Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy | Karl D. Gordon, G. C. Sloan, Macarena Garcia Marin, Mattia Libralato, George Rieke, Jonathan A. Aguilar, Ralph Bohlin, Misty Cracraft, Marjorie Decleir, Andras Gaspar, David R. Law, Alberto Noriega&#45;Crespo, Michael Regan | &#160;&#160;The absolute flux calibration of the Mid&#45;Infrared Instrument Imaging and&#10;Coronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first&#10;2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the&#10;flux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays,&#10;and different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining&#10;observed aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions&#10;based on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of&#10;these observations were combined with model point&#45;spread&#45;functions to measure&#10;the corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with&#10;time, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time,&#10;rate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations&#10;were with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately&#10;every month revealed a modest time&#45;dependent response loss seen mainly at the&#10;longest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential&#10;with a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the&#10;band&#45;dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was&#10;found to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different&#10;subarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting&#10;for the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors&#10;measured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The&#10;formal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are&#10;0.3 to 1.0%, with longer&#45;wavelength bands generally having larger&#10;uncertainties.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10443v1) |&#10;| CtRNet&#45;X: Camera&#45;to&#45;Robot Pose Estimation in Real&#45;world Conditions Using&#10; &#160;a Single Camera | Jingpei Lu, Zekai Liang, Tristin Xie, Florian Ritcher, Shan Lin, Sainan Liu, Michael C. Yip | &#160;&#160;Camera&#45;to&#45;robot calibration is crucial for vision&#45;based robot control and&#10;requires effort to make it accurate. Recent advancements in markerless pose&#10;estimation methods have eliminated the need for time&#45;consuming physical setups&#10;for camera&#45;to&#45;robot calibration. While the existing markerless pose estimation&#10;methods have demonstrated impressive accuracy without the need for cumbersome&#10;setups, they rely on the assumption that all the robot joints are visible&#10;within the camera&#39;s field of view. However, in practice, robots usually move in&#10;and out of view, and some portion of the robot may stay out&#45;of&#45;frame during the&#10;whole manipulation task due to real&#45;world constraints, leading to a lack of&#10;sufficient visual features and subsequent failure of these approaches. To&#10;address this challenge and enhance the applicability to vision&#45;based robot&#10;control, we propose a novel framework capable of estimating the robot pose with&#10;partially visible robot manipulators. Our approach leverages the&#10;Vision&#45;Language Models for fine&#45;grained robot components detection, and&#10;integrates it into a keypoint&#45;based pose estimation network, which enables more&#10;robust performance in varied operational conditions. The framework is evaluated&#10;on both public robot datasets and self&#45;collected partial&#45;view datasets to&#10;demonstrate our robustness and generalizability. As a result, this method is&#10;effective for robot pose estimation in a wider range of real&#45;world manipulation&#10;scenarios.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10441v1) |&#10;| Successive topological phase transitions in two distinct spin&#45;flop&#10; &#160;phases on the honeycomb lattice | Xudong Li, Jize Zhao, Jinbin Li, Qiang Luo | &#160;&#160;The Kitaev magnets with bond&#45;dependent interactions have garnered&#10;considerable attention in recent years for their ability to harbor exotic&#10;phases and nontrivial excitations. The topological magnons, which are indicated&#10;by nonzero Chern number and thermal Hall conductivity, are proposed to&#10;partially explain thermal Hall measurements in real materials. Hitherto,&#10;topological magnons have been extensively explored when the magnetic field is&#10;normal to the honeycomb plane, but their topological characteristics are less&#10;studied in the presence of in&#45;plane magnetic field. Here, we study two distinct&#10;in&#45;plane field induced spin&#45;flop phases in the $Gamma$&#45;$Gamma&#39;$ model, both&#10;of which are off&#45;diagonal couplings that have intimate relation to the Kitaev&#10;interaction. The two spin&#45;flop phases are distinguished by their out&#45;of&#45;plane&#10;spin components which can be either antiparallel or parallel, thus dubbing&#10;antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) spin&#45;flop phases, respectively.&#10;We map out topological phase diagrams for both phases, revealing a rich pattern&#10;of the Chern number over exchange parameters and magnetic field. We&#10;analytically calculate the boundaries of topological phase transitions when the&#10;magnetic field is along the $a$ and $b$ directions. We find that the thermal&#10;Hall conductivity and its derivative display contrasting behaviors when&#10;crossing different topological phase transitions. The striking difference of&#10;the two phases lies in that when the magnetic field is along the $b$ direction,&#10;topological magnons are totally absent in the AFM spin&#45;flop phase, while they&#10;can survive in the FM analogue in certain parameter regions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10439v1) |&#10;| A functorial approach to $n$&#45;abelian categories | Vitor Gulisz | &#160;&#160;We develop a functorial approach to the study of $n$&#45;abelian categories by&#10;reformulating their axioms in terms of their categories of finitely presented&#10;functors. Such an approach allows the use of classical homological algebra and&#10;representation theory techniques to understand higher homological algebra. As&#10;an application, we present two possible generalizations of the axioms &quot;every&#10;monomorphism is a kernel&quot; and &quot;every epimorphism is a cokernel&quot; of an abelian&#10;category to $n$&#45;abelian categories. We also specialize our results to modules&#10;over rings, thereby describing when the category of finitely generated&#10;projective modules over a ring is $n$&#45;abelian. Moreover, we establish a&#10;correspondence for $n$&#45;abelian categories with additive generators, which&#10;extends the higher Auslander correspondence.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10438v1) |&#10;| Color symmetry breaking in the Potts spin glass | Jean&#45;Christophe Mourrat | &#160;&#160;The Potts spin glass is an analogue of the Sherrington&#45;Kirkpatrick model in&#10;which each spin can take one of $kappa$ possible values, which we interpret as&#10;colors.

Whole genome sequence data augmented with demographic metadata&#10;provides the best opportunity to do this. We use Random Forest Decision Tree&#10;models to analyse a combination of over 4000 SARS&#45;CoV2 sequences from a densely&#10;sampled, mixed urban and rural population (Tayside) in Scotland in the period&#10;from August 2020 to July 2021, with fine scale geographical and&#10;socio&#45;demographic metadata. Comparing periods in versus out of &quot;lockdown&quot;&#10;restrictions, we show using genetic distance relationships that individuals&#10;from more deprived areas are more likely to get infected during lockdown but&#10;less likely to spread the infection further. As disadvantaged communities were&#10;the most affected by both COVID&#45;19 and its restrictions, our finding has&#10;important implications for informing future approaches to control future&#10;pandemics driven by similar respiratory infections.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10436v1) |&#10;| A study of pure multi&#45;strange hadrons production in Pb+Pb collisions at&#10; &#160;LHC energies using HYDJET++ model | Gauri Devi, B. K. Singh | &#160;&#160;For the present work, we have used the HYDJET++ model to explore the&#10;production of pure multi&#45;strange hadrons in Pb+Pb collisions at&#10;$sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 2.76 TeV and $sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 5.02 TeV collision energies,&#10;respectively. We have simulated the $p_{T}$&#45;spectra and elliptic flow ($v_{2}$)&#10;of $phi$&#45;meson and $Omega$&#45;baryons comparing our results with ALICE&#10;experimental data and several phenomenological models (HIJING/$Boverline{B}$,&#10;VISHNU, EPOS, AMPT, and Krakow) across various centrality intervals.&#10;Additionally, we have calculated the nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$ and&#10;$R_{CP}$), which provide a perception of jet quenching phenomena. Hence, our&#10;findings enable the study of the energy and system dependence of $phi$ and&#10;$Omega$ hadrons production over a wide range of ultra&#45;relativistic collision&#10;energies. We also present the particle ratios ($Omega/phi$,&#10;$overline{Omega}^{+}/Omega^{&#45;}$, $Omega/pi$, and $phi/pi$), offering&#10;insights on the strangeness enhancement and chemical properties of the medium&#10;at both LHC collision energies.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10435v1) |&#10;| Magnetic metamaterials by ion&#45;implantation | Christina Vantaraki, Petter Ström, Tuan T.

Sadowski, Daniel Primetzhofer, Vassilios Kapaklis | &#160;&#160;We present a method for the additive fabrication of planar magnetic&#10;nanoarrays with minimal surface roughness. Synthesis is accomplished by&#10;combining electron&#45;beam lithography, used to generate nanometric patterned&#10;masks, with ion implantation in thin films. By implanting $^{56}$Fe$^{+}$ ions,&#10;we are able to introduce magnetic functionality in a controlled manner into&#10;continuous Pd thin films, achieving 3D spatial resolution down to a few tens of&#10;nanometers. Our results demonstrate the successful application of this&#10;technique in fabricating square artificial spin ice lattices, which exhibit&#10;well&#45;defined magnetization textures and interactions among the patterned&#10;magnetic elements.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10433v1) |&#10;| Structure&#45;preserving learning for multi&#45;symplectic PDEs | Süleyman Yıldız, Pawan Goyal, Peter Benner | &#160;&#160;This paper presents an energy&#45;preserving machine learning method for&#10;inferring reduced&#45;order models (ROMs) by exploiting the multi&#45;symplectic form&#10;of partial differential equations (PDEs). The vast majority of&#10;energy&#45;preserving reduced&#45;order methods use symplectic Galerkin projection to&#10;construct reduced&#45;order Hamiltonian models by projecting the full models onto a&#10;symplectic subspace. However, symplectic projection requires the existence of&#10;fully discrete operators, and in many cases, such as black&#45;box PDE solvers,&#10;these operators are inaccessible. In this work, we propose an energy&#45;preserving&#10;machine learning method that can infer the dynamics of the given PDE using data&#10;only, so that the proposed framework does not depend on the fully discrete&#10;operators. In this context, the proposed method is non&#45;intrusive. The proposed&#10;method is grey box in the sense that it requires only some basic knowledge of&#10;the multi&#45;symplectic model at the partial differential equation level. We prove&#10;that the proposed method satisfies spatially discrete local energy conservation&#10;and preserves the multi&#45;symplectic conservation laws. We test our method on the&#10;linear wave equation, the Korteweg&#45;de Vries equation, and the&#10;Zakharov&#45;Kuznetsov equation. We test the generalization of our learned models&#10;by testing them far outside the training time interval.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10432v1) |&#10;| Hippocampal synchronization in a realistic CA1 neuron model | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore | &#160;&#160;This work delves into studying the synchronization in two realistic neuron&#10;models using Hodgkin&#45;Huxley dynamics. Unlike simplistic point&#45;like models,&#10;excitatory synapses are here randomly distributed along the dendrites,&#10;introducing strong stochastic contributions into their signal propagation. To&#10;focus on the role of different excitatory positions, we use two copies of the&#10;same neuron whose synapses are located at different distances from the soma and&#10;are exposed to identical Poissonian distributed current pulses. The&#10;synchronization is investigated through a specifically defined spiking&#10;correlation function, and its behavior is analyzed as a function of several&#10;parameters: inhibition weight, distance from the soma of one synaptic group,&#10;excitatory inactivation delay, and weight of the excitatory synapses.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10431v1) |&#10;| Meta&#45;Whisper: Speech&#45;Based Meta&#45;ICL for ASR on Low&#45;Resource Languages | Ming&#45;Hao Hsu, Kuan Po Huang, Hung&#45;yi Lee | &#160;&#160;This paper presents Meta&#45;Whisper, a novel approach to improve automatic&#10;speech recognition (ASR) for low&#45;resource languages using the Whisper model.

This approach mitigates risks&#10;associated with compromised or untrusted devices, common in traditional quantum&#10;communication.&#10; &#160;In this paper, we propose the first of its kind DI&#45;QSDC protocol with user&#10;identity authentication. This ensures the authenticity of both the sender and&#10;receiver prior to message exchange. We then discuss the security of the&#10;proposed protocol against common attacks, demonstrating that no eavesdropper&#10;gains any information from either the quantum or the classical channel. Next,&#10;we implement the protocol on IBM&#39;s quantum hardware and evaluate its&#10;performance in a realistic noisy environment. Additionally, by simulating&#10;common attack models, we showcase that the protocol is secure against any&#10;eavesdropper in the channel.

Breakdown of&#10;time&#45;reversal symmetry (BTRS) is a hallmark of such dissipative non&#45;equilibrium&#10;dynamics. We introduce a robust, experimentally accessible, noninvasive,&#10;quantitative measure of BTRS in terms of the Kullback&#45;Leibler divergence in&#10;collision events, demonstrated in our novel artificial active matter, comprised&#10;of battery&#45;powered spherical rolling robots whose energetics in different modes&#10;of motion can be measured with high precision. Our dimensionless measure&#10;characterizes how dissipation and internal energetics are influenced by&#10;kinematic constraints from interactions with the environment. We propose this&#10;measure of BTRS as an empirical estimate of the distance from equilibrium. An&#10;energetic insight into this departure of active matter from equilibrium comes&#10;from our demonstration of a non&#45;trivial fluctuation symmetry, which reveals a&#10;potentially universal thermodynamic characteristic of active energetics. As a&#10;many&#45;body consequence of BTRS in our experimental active system, we demonstrate&#10;the emergence of activity&#45;induced herding, which has no equilibrium analogue.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10425v1) |&#10;| Unveiling V Modes: Enhancing CMB Sensitivity to BSM Physics with a&#10; &#160;Non&#45;Ideal Half&#45;Wave Plate | N. Raffuzzi, M. Lembo, S. Giardiello, M. Gerbino, M. Lattanzi, P. Natoli, L. Pagano | &#160;&#160;V&#45;mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background is expected to be&#10;vanishingly small in the $Lambda$CDM model and, hence, usually ignored.&#10;Nonetheless, several astrophysical effects, as well as beyond standard model&#10;physics could produce it at a detectable level. A realistic half&#45;wave plate &#45;&#10;an optical element commonly used in CMB experiments to modulate the polarized&#10;signal &#45; can provide sensitivity to V modes without significantly spoiling that&#10;to linear polarization. We assess this sensitivity for some new&#45;generation CMB&#10;experiments, such as the LiteBIRD satellite, the ground&#45;based Simons&#10;Observatory and a CMB&#45;S4&#45;like experiment. We forecast the efficiency of these&#10;experiments to constrain the phenomenology of certain classes of BSM models&#10;inducing mixing of linear polarization states and generation of V modes in the&#10;CMB. We find that new&#45;generation experiments can improve current limits by&#10;1&#45;to&#45;3 orders of magnitude, depending on the data combination. The inclusion of&#10;V&#45;mode information dramatically boosts the sensitivity to these BSM models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10424v1) |&#10;| Initial data for a deformed isolated horizon | Aleš Flandera, David Kofroň, Tomáš Ledvinka | &#160;&#160;Within the isolated horizon formalism, we investigate a static axisymmetric&#10;space&#45;time of a black hole influenced by matter in its neighborhood. To&#10;illustrate the role of ingredients and assumptions in this formalism, we first&#10;show how, in spherical symmetry, the field equations and gauge conditions imply&#10;the isolated horizon initial data leading to the Schwarzschild space&#45;time.&#10;Then, we construct the initial data for a static axisymmetric isolated horizon&#10;representing a deformed black hole. The space&#45;time description in the&#10;Bondi&#45;like coordinates is then found as a series expansion in the vicinity of&#10;the horizon. To graphically illustrate this construction, we also find a&#10;numerical solution for a black hole deformed by a particular analytic model of&#10;a thin accretion disk. We also discuss how an accretion disk affects the&#10;analytical properties of the horizon geometry.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10423v1) |&#10;| Learning Semi&#45;Supervised Medical Image Segmentation from Spatial&#10; &#160;Registration | Qianying Liu, Paul Henderson, Xiao Gu, Hang Dai, Fani Deligianni | &#160;&#160;Semi&#45;supervised medical image segmentation has shown promise in training&#10;models with limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. However,&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methods ignore a potentially valuable source of unsupervised&#10;semantic information &#45;&#45; spatial registration transforms between image volumes.&#10;To address this, we propose CCT&#45;R, a contrastive cross&#45;teaching framework&#10;incorporating registration information. To leverage the semantic information&#10;available in registrations between volume pairs, CCT&#45;R incorporates two&#10;proposed modules: Registration Supervision Loss (RSL) and Registration&#45;Enhanced&#10;Positive Sampling (REPS). The RSL leverages segmentation knowledge derived from&#10;transforms between labeled and unlabeled volume pairs, providing an additional&#10;source of pseudo&#45;labels. REPS enhances contrastive learning by identifying&#10;anatomically&#45;corresponding positives across volumes using registration&#10;transforms. Experimental results on two challenging medical segmentation&#10;benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CCT&#45;R across&#10;various semi&#45;supervised settings, with as few as one labeled case. Our code is&#10;available at&#10;https://github.com/kathyliu579/ContrastiveCross&#45;teachingWithRegistration.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10422v1) |&#10;| Multidimensional Deconvolution with Profiling | Huanbiao Zhu, Krish Desai, Mikael Kuusela, Vinicius Mikuni, Benjamin Nachman, Larry Wasserman | &#160;&#160;In many experimental contexts, it is necessary to statistically remove the&#10;impact of instrumental effects in order to physically interpret measurements.&#10;This task has been extensively studied in particle physics, where the&#10;deconvolution task is called unfolding. A number of recent methods have shown&#10;how to perform high&#45;dimensional, unbinned unfolding using machine learning.&#10;However, one of the assumptions in all of these methods is that the detector&#10;response is accurately modeled in the Monte Carlo simulation. In practice, the&#10;detector response depends on a number of nuisance parameters that can be&#10;constrained with data. We propose a new algorithm called Profile OmniFold&#10;(POF), which works in a similar iterative manner as the OmniFold (OF) algorithm&#10;while being able to simultaneously profile the nuisance parameters. We&#10;illustrate the method with a Gaussian example as a proof of concept&#10;highlighting its promising capabilities.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10421v1) |&#10;| HiFi&#45;CS: Towards Open Vocabulary Visual Grounding For Robotic Grasping&#10; &#160;Using Vision&#45;Language Models | Vineet Bhat, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Ramesh Karri, Farshad Khorrami | &#160;&#160;Robots interacting with humans through natural language can unlock numerous&#10;applications such as Referring Grasp Synthesis (RGS). Given a text query, RGS&#10;determines a stable grasp pose to manipulate the referred object in the robot&#39;s&#10;workspace. RGS comprises two steps: visual grounding and grasp pose estimation.&#10;Recent studies leverage powerful Vision&#45;Language Models (VLMs) for visually&#10;grounding free&#45;flowing natural language in real&#45;world robotic execution.&#10;However, comparisons in complex, cluttered environments with multiple instances&#10;of the same object are lacking. This paper introduces HiFi&#45;CS, featuring&#10;hierarchical application of Featurewise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to fuse image&#10;and text embeddings, enhancing visual grounding for complex attribute rich text&#10;queries encountered in robotic grasping. Visual grounding associates an object&#10;in 2D/3D space with natural language input and is studied in two scenarios:&#10;Closed and Open Vocabulary. HiFi&#45;CS features a lightweight decoder combined&#10;with a frozen VLM and outperforms competitive baselines in closed vocabulary&#10;settings while being 100x smaller in size. Our model can effectively guide&#10;open&#45;set object detectors like GroundedSAM to enhance open&#45;vocabulary&#10;performance. We validate our approach through real&#45;world RGS experiments using&#10;a 7&#45;DOF robotic arm, achieving 90.33% visual grounding accuracy in 15 tabletop&#10;scenes. We include our codebase in the supplementary material.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10419v1) |&#10;| X&#45;ray reverberation as an explanation for UV/optical variability in&#10; &#160;nearby Seyferts | M. Papoutsis, I. E. Papadakis, C. Panagiotou, M. Dovčiak, E. Kammoun | &#160;&#160;Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to be variable across all&#10;wavelengths. Significant observational efforts have been invested in the last&#10;decade in studying their ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability. Long and&#10;densely sampled, multi&#45;wavelength monitoring campaigns of numerous Seyfert&#10;galaxies have been conducted with the aim of determining the X&#45;ray/UV/optical&#10;continuum time lags. Time&#45;lag studies can be used to constrain theoretical&#10;models. The observed time lags can be explained by thermal reprocessing of the&#10;X&#45;rays illuminating the accretion disc (known as the X&#45;ray reverberation&#10;model). However, the observed light curves contain more information that can be&#10;used to further constrain physical models. Our primary objective is to&#10;investigate whether, in addition to time lags, the X&#45;ray reverberation model&#10;can also explain the UV/optical variability amplitude of nearby Seyferts. To do&#10;this, we measured the excess variance of four sources (namely Mrk 509, NGC&#10;4151, NGC 2617, and Mrk 142) as a function of wavelength using data from&#10;archival long, multi&#45;wavelength campaigns with Swift, and ground&#45;based&#10;telescopes. We also computed the model excess variance in the case of the X&#45;ray&#10;reverberation model by determining the disc&#39;s transfer function and assuming a&#10;bending power law for the X&#45;ray power spectrum. We tested the validity of the&#10;model by comparing the measured and model variances for a range of accretion&#10;rates and X&#45;ray source heights. We conclude that the X&#45;ray thermal&#10;reverberation model can fit both the continuum, UV/optical time lags, as well&#10;as the variance in these AGNs, for the same physical parameters. Our results&#10;suggest that the accretion disc is constant and that all the observed&#10;UV/optical variations, on timescales of days and up to a few weeks, can be&#10;fully explained by the variable X&#45;rays as they illuminate the accretion disc.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10417v1) |&#10;| Local central limit theorem for Mallows measure | Alexey Bufetov, Kailun Chen | &#160;&#160;We study the statistics of the Mallows measure on permutations in the limit&#10;pioneered by Starr (2009).

We also re&#45;derive versions of the law of large numbers&#10;and the large deviation principle, obtain the standard central limit theorem&#10;from the local one, and establish a multi&#45;point version of the local central&#10;limit theorem.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10415v1) |&#10;| On interactive anisotropic walks in two dimensions generated from a&#10; &#160;three state opinion dynamics model | Surajit Saha, Parongama Sen | &#160;&#160;A system of interacting walkers on a two&#45;dimensional space where the dynamics&#10;of each walker are governed by the opinions of agents of a three&#45;state opinion&#10;dynamics model are considered. Such walks, inspired by Ising&#45;like models and&#10;opinions dynamics models, are usually considered in one&#45;dimensional virtual&#10;spaces. Here, the mapping is done in such a way that the walk is directed along&#10;the $y$ axis while it can move either way along the $x$ axis. We explore the&#10;properties of such walks as the parameter representing the noise in the opinion&#10;dynamics model, responsible for a continuous phase transition, is varied. The&#10;walk features show marked differences as the system crosses the critical point.&#10;The bivariate distribution of the displacements below the critical point is a&#10;modified biased Gaussian function of x and y which is symmetric about the X&#10;axis.&#10; &#160;The marginal probability distributions can be extracted and the scaling forms&#10;of different quantities, showing power law behaviour, are obtained. The&#10;directed nature of the walk is reflected in the marginal distributions as well&#10;as in the exponents.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10413v1) |&#10;| A Large&#45;Scale Privacy Assessment of Android Third&#45;Party SDKs | Mark Huasong Meng, Chuan Yan, Yun Hao, Qing Zhang, Zeyu Wang, Kailong Wang, Sin Gee Teo, Guangdong Bai, Jin Song Dong | &#160;&#160;Third&#45;party Software Development Kits (SDKs) are widely adopted in Android&#10;app development, to effortlessly accelerate development pipelines and enhance&#10;app functionality. However, this convenience raises substantial concerns about&#10;unauthorized access to users&#39; privacy&#45;sensitive information, which could be&#10;further abused for illegitimate purposes like user tracking or monetization.&#10;Our study offers a targeted analysis of user privacy protection among Android&#10;third&#45;party SDKs, filling a critical gap in the Android software supply chain.&#10;It focuses on two aspects of their privacy practices, including data&#10;exfiltration and behavior&#45;policy compliance (or privacy compliance), utilizing&#10;techniques of taint analysis and large language models. It covers 158&#10;widely&#45;used SDKs from two key SDK release platforms, the official one and a&#10;large alternative one. From them, we identified 338 instances of privacy data&#10;exfiltration. On the privacy compliance, our study reveals that more than 30%&#10;of the examined SDKs fail to provide a privacy policy to disclose their data&#10;handling practices. Among those that provide privacy policies, 37% of them&#10;over&#45;collect user data, and 88% falsely claim access to sensitive data. We&#10;revisit the latest versions of the SDKs after 12 months. Our analysis&#10;demonstrates a persistent lack of improvement in these concerning trends. Based&#10;on our findings, we propose three actionable recommendations to mitigate the&#10;privacy leakage risks and enhance privacy protection for Android users. Our&#10;research not only serves as an urgent call for industry attention but also&#10;provides crucial insights for future regulatory interventions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10411v1) |&#10;| A point process approach for the classification of noisy calcium imaging&#10; &#160;data | Arianna Burzacchi, Nicoletta D&#39;Angelo, David Payares&#45;Garcia, Jorge Mateu | &#160;&#160;We study noisy calcium imaging data, with a focus on the classification of&#10;spike traces. As raw traces obscure the true temporal structure of neuron&#39;s&#10;activity, we performed a tuned filtering of the calcium concentration using two&#10;methods: a biophysical model and a kernel mapping. The former characterizes&#10;spike trains related to a particular triggering event, while the latter filters&#10;out the signal and refines the selection of the underlying neuronal response.&#10;Transitioning from traditional time series analysis to point process theory,&#10;the study explores spike&#45;time distance metrics and point pattern prototypes to&#10;describe repeated observations. We assume that the analyzed neuron&#39;s firing&#10;events, i.e. spike occurrences, are temporal point process events. In&#10;particular, the study aims to categorize 47 point patterns by depth, assuming&#10;the similarity of spike occurrences within specific depth categories. The&#10;results highlight the pivotal roles of depth and stimuli in discerning diverse&#10;temporal structures of neuron firing events, confirming the point process&#10;approach based on prototype analysis is largely useful in the classification of&#10;spike traces.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10409v1) |&#10;| Variational closures for composite homogenised fluid flows | Theo Diamantakis, Ruiao Hu | &#160;&#160;The Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport is a variational formulation of&#10;stochastic fluid dynamics introduced to model the effects of unresolved scales,&#10;whilst preserving the geometric structure of ideal fluid flows. In this work,&#10;we show that the SALT equations can arise from the decomposition of the fluid&#10;flow map into its mean and fluctuating components. The fluctuating component is&#10;realised as a prescribed stochastic diffeomorphism that introduces stochastic&#10;transport into the system and we construct it using homogenisation theory. The&#10;dynamics of the mean component are derived from a variational principle&#10;utilising particular forms of variations that preserve the composite structure&#10;of the flow. Using a new variational principle, we show that SALT equations can&#10;arise from random Lagrangians and are equivalent to random coefficient PDEs. We&#10;also demonstrate how to modify the composite flow and the associated&#10;variational principle to derive models inspired by the Lagrangian Averaged&#10;Euler&#45;Poincare (LAEP) theory.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10408v1) |&#10;| Bitcoin Transaction Behavior Modeling Based on Balance Data | Yu Zhang, Claudio Tessone | &#160;&#160;When analyzing Bitcoin users&#39; balance distribution, we observed that it&#10;follows a log&#45;normal pattern. Drawing parallels from the successful application&#10;of Gibrat&#39;s law of proportional growth in explaining city size and word&#10;frequency distributions, we tested whether the same principle could account for&#10;the log&#45;normal distribution in Bitcoin balances. However, our calculations&#10;revealed that the exponent parameters in both the drift and variance terms&#10;deviate slightly from one. This suggests that Gibrat&#39;s proportional growth rule&#10;alone does not fully explain the log&#45;normal distribution observed in Bitcoin&#10;users&#39; balances. During our exploration, we discovered an intriguing&#10;phenomenon: Bitcoin users tend to fall into two distinct categories based on&#10;their behavior, which we refer to as ``poor&quot; and ``wealthy&quot; users. Poor users,&#10;who initially purchase only a small amount of Bitcoin, tend to buy more&#10;bitcoins first and then sell out all their holdings gradually over time. The&#10;certainty of selling all their coins is higher and higher with time. In&#10;contrast, wealthy users, who acquire a large amount of Bitcoin from the start,&#10;tend to sell off their holdings over time. The speed at which they sell their&#10;bitcoins is lower and lower over time and they will hold at least a small part&#10;of their initial holdings at last. Interestingly, the wealthier the user, the&#10;larger the proportion of their balance and the higher the certainty they tend&#10;to sell. This research provided an interesting perspective to explore bitcoin&#10;users&#39; behaviors which may apply to other finance markets.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10407v1) |&#10;| Stochastic Data&#45;Driven Predictive Control: Chance&#45;Constraint&#10; &#160;Satisfaction with Identified Multi&#45;step Predictors | Haldun Balim, Andrea Carron, Melanie N. Zeilinger, Johannes Köhler | &#160;&#160;We propose a novel data&#45;driven stochastic model predictive control framework&#10;for uncertain linear systems with noisy output measurements. Our approach&#10;leverages multi&#45;step predictors to efficiently propagate uncertainty, ensuring&#10;chance constraint satisfaction with minimal conservatism. In particular, we&#10;present a strategy to identify multi&#45;step predictors and quantify the&#10;associated uncertainty using a surrogate (data&#45;driven) state space model. Then,&#10;we utilize the derived distribution to formulate a constraint tightening that&#10;ensures chance constraint satisfaction. A numerical example highlights the&#10;reduced conservatism of handling parametric uncertainty in the proposed method&#10;compared to state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art solutions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10405v1) |&#10;| A Knowledge&#45;Enhanced Disease Diagnosis Method Based on Prompt Learning&#10; &#160;and BERT Integration | Zhang Zheng | &#160;&#160;This paper proposes a knowledge&#45;enhanced disease diagnosis method based on a&#10;prompt learning framework. The method retrieves structured knowledge from&#10;external knowledge graphs related to clinical cases, encodes it, and injects it&#10;into the prompt templates to enhance the language model&#39;s understanding and&#10;reasoning capabilities for the task.We conducted experiments on three public&#10;datasets: CHIP&#45;CTC, IMCS&#45;V2&#45;NER, and KUAKE&#45;QTR. The results show that the&#10;proposed method significantly outperforms existing models across multiple&#10;evaluation metrics, with an F1 score improvement of 2.4% on the CHIP&#45;CTC&#10;dataset, 3.1% on the IMCS&#45;V2&#45;NER dataset,and 4.2% on the KUAKE&#45;QTR dataset.&#10;Additionally,ablation studies confirmed the critical role of the knowledge&#10;injection module,as the removal of this module resulted in a significant drop&#10;in F1 score. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not&#10;only effectively improves the accuracy of disease diagnosis but also enhances&#10;the interpretability of the predictions, providing more reliable support and&#10;evidence for clinical diagnosis.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10403v1) |&#10;| A Statistical Equilibrium Approach to Adam Smith&#39;s Labor Theory of Value | Ellis Scharfenaker, Bruno Theodosio, Duncan K.

In meiosis II mouse oocytes (developing egg cells) awaiting&#10;fertilisation, the spindle, which is the protein structure responsible for&#10;dividing genetic material in a cell, must maintain its position near the cell&#10;cortex (the thin actin network bound to the cell membrane) for many hours.&#10;However, the cytoplasmic streaming that accompanies this stable positioning&#10;would intuitively appear to destabilise the spindle position. Here, through a&#10;combination of numerical and analytical modelling, we reveal a new,&#10;hydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning beneath the cortical cap.&#10;We show that this stability depends critically on the spindle size and the&#10;active driving from the cortex, and demonstrate that stable spindle positioning&#10;can result purely from a hydrodynamic suction force exerted on the spindle by&#10;the cytoplasmic flow. Our findings show that local fluid dynamic forces can be&#10;sufficient to stabilise the spindle, explaining robustness against&#10;perturbations not only perpendicular but also parallel to the cortex. Our&#10;results shed light on the importance of cytoplasmic streaming in mammalian&#10;meiosis.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10401v1) |&#10;| Sherpa: An Open Source Python Fitting Package | Aneta Siemiginowska, Douglas Burke, Hans Moritz Günther, Nicholas P.

Dejrah | &#160;&#160;We focus on the inflationary predictions of $beta$&#45;exponential potential&#10;models, in which the inflaton is a representation of the field delineating the&#10;size of extra&#45;dimension. Since it offers a well&#45;motivated starting point for&#10;the study of physics at very high energies, we incorporate an $R^2$ term in the&#10;Palatini gravity. In addition, afterward the inflation, the inflaton oscillates&#10;about the minimum of the inflation potential, and reheats the universe. This&#10;occurs during the reheating phase, at which the inflaton decays into the&#10;standard model particles, which fill the universe. We extend our examination by&#10;considering the reheating effects on inflationary observables by employing the&#10;different scenarios of the reheat temperature. Supposing the standard thermal&#10;history after inflation, we display the inflationary predictions, $n_s, r,&#10;mathrm{d}n_s/mathrm{d}&#10;n k$ of $beta$&#45;exponential potential with minimal&#10;coupling in Palatini $R^2$ gravity. Also, different kinds of constraints from a&#10;variety of observations, such as BICEP/Keck, Planck 2018, as well as future&#10;possible detectable sensitivities that might be reached by CMB experiments:&#10;CMB&#45;S4 and LiteBIRD are taken into account in this work. We indicate that our&#10;results are consistent with both the latest data and the future sensitivity&#10;forecasts of LiteBIRD/Planck and CMB&#45;S4. Finally, the results in this study&#10;highlight the viability of our model even in the case of the existence of more&#10;stringent constraints expected from future achievable confidence level limits.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10398v1) |&#10;| Quantifying Observational Projection Effects with a Simulation&#45;based hot&#10; &#160;CGM model | Soumya Shreeram, Johan Comparat, Andrea Merloni, Yi Zhang, Gabriele Ponti, Kirpal Nandra, John ZuHone, Ilaria Marini, Stephan Vladutescu&#45;Zopp, Paola Popesso, Ruediger Pakmor, Riccardo Seppi, Celine Peroux, Daniele Sorini | &#160;&#160;The hot phase of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) allows us to probe the&#10;inflow and outflow of gas within a galaxy, which is responsible for dictating&#10;the evolution of the galaxy. Studying the hot CGM sheds light on a better&#10;understanding of gas physics, which is crucial to inform and constrain&#10;simulation models. With the recent advances in observational measurements&#10;probing the hot CGM in X&#45;rays and tSZ, we have a new avenue for widening our&#10;knowledge of gas physics and feedback by exploiting the information from&#10;current/future observations. In this paper, we use the TNG300 hydrodynamical&#10;simulations to build a fully self&#45;consistent forward model for the hot CGM. We&#10;construct a lightcone and generate mock X&#45;ray observations. We quantify the&#10;projection effects, namely the locally correlated large&#45;scale structure in&#10;X&#45;rays and the effect due to satellite galaxies misclassified as centrals which&#10;affects the measured hot CGM galactocentric profiles in stacking experiments.&#10;We present an analytical model that describes the intrinsic X&#45;ray surface&#10;brightness profile across the stellar and halo mass bins. The increasing&#10;stellar mass bins result in decreasing values of $beta$, the exponent&#10;quantifying the slope of the intrinsic galactocentric profiles. We carry&#10;forward the current state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art by also showing the impact of the locally&#10;correlated environment on the measured X&#45;ray surface brightness profiles. We&#10;also present, for the first time, the effect of misclassified centrals in&#10;stacking experiments for three stellar mass bins: $10^{10.5&#45;11} M_odot$,&#10;$10^{11&#45;11.2} M_odot$, and $10^{11.2&#45;11.5} M_odot$. We find that the&#10;contaminating effect of the misclassified centrals on the stacked profiles&#10;increases when the stellar mass decreases.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10397v1) |&#10;| MOST: MR reconstruction Optimization for multiple downStream Tasks via&#10; &#160;continual learning | Hwihun Jeong, Se Young Chun, Jongho Lee | &#160;&#160;Deep learning&#45;based Magnetic Resonance (MR) reconstruction methods have&#10;focused on generating high&#45;quality images but they often overlook the impact on&#10;downstream tasks (e.g., segmentation) that utilize the reconstructed images.&#10;Cascading separately trained reconstruction network and downstream task network&#10;has been shown to introduce performance degradation due to error propagation&#10;and domain gaps between training datasets. To mitigate this issue, downstream&#10;task&#45;oriented reconstruction optimization has been proposed for a single&#10;downstream task. Expanding this optimization to multi&#45;task scenarios is not&#10;straightforward. In this work, we extended this optimization to sequentially&#10;introduced multiple downstream tasks and demonstrated that a single MR&#10;reconstruction network can be optimized for multiple downstream tasks by&#10;deploying continual learning (MOST). MOST integrated techniques from&#10;replay&#45;based continual learning and image&#45;guided loss to overcome catastrophic&#10;forgetting. Comparative experiments demonstrated that MOST outperformed a&#10;reconstruction network without finetuning, a reconstruction network with&#10;na&quot;ive finetuning, and conventional continual learning methods.

In particular, we analyse the task of&#10;textit{multicopy state teleportation}, where Alice has $k$ identical copies of&#10;an arbitrary unknown $d$&#45;dimensional qudit state $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to teleport&#10;a single copy of $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to Bob using a maximally entangled&#10;two&#45;qudit state shared between Alice and Bob without Bob&#39;s correction. Alice&#10;may perform a joint measurement on her half of the entangled state and the $k$&#10;copies of $vertpsi&#13;angle$. We prove that the maximal probability of success&#10;for teleporting the exact state $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to Bob is&#10;$p(d,k)=frac{k}{d(k&#45;1+d)}$ and present an explicit protocol to attain this&#10;performance. Then, by utilising $k$ copies of an arbitrary target state&#10;$vertpsi&#13;angle$, we show how the multicopy state teleportation protocol can&#10;be employed to enhance the success probability of storage and retrieval of&#10;quantum programs, which aims to universally retrieve the action of an arbitrary&#10;quantum channel that is stored in a state. Our proofs make use of group&#10;representation theory methods, which may find applications beyond the problems&#10;addressed in this work.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10393v1) |&#10;| TPFL: Tsetlin&#45;Personalized Federated Learning with Confidence&#45;Based&#10; &#160;Clustering | Rasoul Jafari Gohari, Laya Aliahmadipour, Ezat Valipour | &#160;&#160;The world of Machine Learning (ML) has witnessed rapid changes in terms of&#10;new models and ways to process users data. The majority of work that has been&#10;done is focused on Deep Learning (DL) based approaches. However, with the&#10;emergence of new algorithms such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm, there&#10;is growing interest in exploring alternative approaches that may offer unique&#10;advantages in certain domains or applications. One of these domains is&#10;Federated Learning (FL), in which users privacy is of utmost importance. Due to&#10;its novelty, FL has seen a surge in the incorporation of personalization&#10;techniques to enhance model accuracy while maintaining user privacy under&#10;personalized conditions. In this work, we propose a novel approach dubbed TPFL:&#10;Tsetlin&#45;Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into&#10;clusters based on their confidence towards a specific class. In this way,&#10;clustering can benefit from two key advantages. Firstly, clients share only&#10;what they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight&#10;aggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been&#10;enough during the training. This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are&#10;non&#45;Independent and Identically Distributed (non&#45;IID). Secondly, by sharing&#10;only weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially&#10;reduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication&#10;cost. The results of TPFL demonstrated the highest accuracy on three different&#10;datasets; namely MNIST, FashionMNIST and FEMNIST.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10392v1) |&#10;| Prompt&#45;and&#45;Transfer: Dynamic Class&#45;aware Enhancement for Few&#45;shot&#10; &#160;Segmentation | Hanbo Bi, Yingchao Feng, Wenhui Diao, Peijin Wang, Yongqiang Mao, Kun Fu, Hongqi Wang, Xian Sun | &#160;&#160;For more efficient generalization to unseen domains (classes), most Few&#45;shot&#10;Segmentation (FSS) would directly exploit pre&#45;trained encoders and only&#10;fine&#45;tune the decoder, especially in the current era of large models. However,&#10;such fixed feature encoders tend to be class&#45;agnostic, inevitably activating&#10;objects that are irrelevant to the target class. In contrast, humans can&#10;effortlessly focus on specific objects in the line of sight. This paper mimics&#10;the visual perception pattern of human beings and proposes a novel and powerful&#10;prompt&#45;driven scheme, called ``Prompt and Transfer&quot; (PAT), which constructs a&#10;dynamic class&#45;aware prompting paradigm to tune the encoder for focusing on the&#10;interested object (target class) in the current task. Three key points are&#10;elaborated to enhance the prompting: 1) Cross&#45;modal linguistic information is&#10;introduced to initialize prompts for each task. 2) Semantic Prompt Transfer&#10;(SPT) that precisely transfers the class&#45;specific semantics within the images&#10;to prompts. 3) Part Mask Generator (PMG) that works in conjunction with SPT to&#10;adaptively generate different but complementary part prompts for different&#10;individuals. Surprisingly, PAT achieves competitive performance on 4 different&#10;tasks including standard FSS, Cross&#45;domain FSS (e.g., CV, medical, and remote&#10;sensing domains), Weak&#45;label FSS, and Zero&#45;shot Segmentation, setting new&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;arts on 11 benchmarks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10389v1) |&#10;| Revising the Structure of Recurrent Neural Networks to Eliminate&#10; &#160;Numerical Derivatives in Forming Physics Informed Loss Terms with Respect to&#10; &#160;Time | Mahyar Jahani&#45;nasab, Mohamad Ali Bijarchi | &#160;&#160;Solving unsteady partial differential equations (PDEs) using recurrent neural&#10;networks (RNNs) typically requires numerical derivatives between each block of&#10;the RNN to form the physics informed loss function. However, this introduces&#10;the complexities of numerical derivatives into the training process of these&#10;models. In this study, we propose modifying the structure of the traditional&#10;RNN to enable the prediction of each block over a time interval, making it&#10;possible to calculate the derivative of the output with respect to time using&#10;the backpropagation algorithm. To achieve this, the time intervals of these&#10;blocks are overlapped, defining a mutual loss function between them.&#10;Additionally, the employment of conditional hidden states enables us to achieve&#10;a unique solution for each block. The forget factor is utilized to control the&#10;influence of the conditional hidden state on the prediction of the subsequent&#10;block. This new model, termed the Mutual Interval RNN (MI&#45;RNN), is applied to&#10;solve three different benchmarks: the Burgers equation, unsteady heat&#10;conduction in an irregular domain, and the Green vortex problem. Our results&#10;demonstrate that MI&#45;RNN can find the exact solution more accurately compared to&#10;existing RNN models. For instance, in the second problem, MI&#45;RNN achieved one&#10;order of magnitude less relative error compared to the RNN model with numerical&#10;derivatives.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10388v1) |&#10;| Sharp decay rate for eigenfunctions of perturbed periodic Schrödinger&#10; &#160;operators | Wencai Liu, Rodrigo Matos, John N. Treuer | &#160;&#160;This paper investigates uniqueness results for perturbed periodic&#10;Schr&quot;odinger operators on $mathbb{Z}^d$. Specifically, we consider operators&#10;of the form $H = &#45;Delta + V + v$, where $Delta$ is the discrete Laplacian,&#10;$V: mathbb{Z}^d &#13;ightarrow mathbb{R}$ is a periodic potential, and $v:&#10;mathbb{Z}^d &#13;ightarrow mathbb{C}$ represents a decaying impurity. We&#10;establish quantitative conditions under which the equation $&#45;Delta u + V u + v&#10;u = &#10;ambda u$, for $&#10;ambda in mathbb{C}$, admits only the trivial solution&#10;$u equiv 0$. Key applications include the absence of embedded eigenvalues for&#10;operators with impurities decaying faster than any exponential function and the&#10;determination of sharp decay rates for eigenfunctions. Our findings extend&#10;previous works by providing precise decay conditions for impurities and&#10;analyzing different spectral regimes of $&#10;ambda$.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10387v1) |&#10;| Mamba&#45;ST: State Space Model for Efficient Style Transfer | Filippo Botti, Alex Ergasti, Leonardo Rossi, Tomaso Fontanini, Claudio Ferrari, Massimo Bertozzi, Andrea Prati | &#160;&#160;The goal of style transfer is, given a content image and a style source,&#10;generating a new image preserving the content but with the artistic&#10;representation of the style source. Most of the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art architectures&#10;use transformers or diffusion&#45;based models to perform this task, despite the&#10;heavy computational burden that they require. In particular, transformers use&#10;self&#45; and cross&#45;attention layers which have large memory footprint, while&#10;diffusion models require high inference time. To overcome the above, this paper&#10;explores a novel design of Mamba, an emergent State&#45;Space Model (SSM), called&#10;Mamba&#45;ST, to perform style transfer. To do so, we adapt Mamba linear equation&#10;to simulate the behavior of cross&#45;attention layers, which are able to combine&#10;two separate embeddings into a single output, but drastically reducing memory&#10;usage and time complexity. We modified the Mamba&#39;s inner equations so to accept&#10;inputs from, and combine, two separate data streams. To the best of our&#10;knowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt the equations of SSMs to a vision&#10;task like style transfer without requiring any other module like&#10;cross&#45;attention or custom normalization layers. An extensive set of experiments&#10;demonstrates the superiority and efficiency of our method in performing style&#10;transfer compared to transformers and diffusion models. Results show improved&#10;quality in terms of both ArtFID and FID metrics.

This module employs the Z4c formulation to solve the Einstein&#10;equations. We demonstrate its accuracy through a series of standard numerical&#10;relativity tests, including convergence of the gravitational waveform from&#10;binary black hole coalescence. Furthermore, we conduct scaling tests on OLCF&#10;Frontier and NERSC Perlmutter, where AthenaK exhibits excellent weak scaling&#10;efficiency of 80% on up to 65,536 AMD MI250X GPUs on Frontier (relative to 4&#10;GPUs) and strong scaling efficiencies of 84% and 77% on AMD MI250X and NVIDIA&#10;A100 GPUs on Frontier and Perlmutter respectively. Additionally, we observe a&#10;significant performance boost, with two orders of magnitude speedup ($gtrsim&#10;200times$) on a GPU compared to a single CPU core, affirming that AthenaK is&#10;well&#45;suited for exascale computing, thereby expanding the potential for&#10;breakthroughs in numerical relativity research.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10383v1) |&#10;| J&#45;UBIK: The JAX&#45;accelerated Universal Bayesian Imaging Kit | Vincent Eberle, Matteo Guardiani, Margret Westerkamp, Philipp Frank, Julian Rüstig, Julia Stadler, Torsten A. Enßlin | &#160;&#160;Many advances in astronomy and astrophysics originate from accurate images of&#10;the sky emission across multiple wavelengths. This often requires&#10;reconstructing spatially and spectrally correlated signals detected from&#10;multiple instruments. To facilitate the high&#45;fidelity imaging of these signals,&#10;we introduce the universal Bayesian imaging kit (UBIK). Specifically, we&#10;present J&#45;UBIK, a flexible and modular implementation leveraging the&#10;JAX&#45;accelerated NIFTy.re software as its backend. J&#45;UBIK streamlines the&#10;implementation of the key Bayesian inference components, providing for all the&#10;necessary steps of Bayesian imaging pipelines. First, it provides adaptable&#10;prior models for different sky realizations. Second, it includes likelihood&#10;models tailored to specific instruments. So far, the package includes three&#10;instruments: Chandra and eROSITA for X&#45;ray observations, and the James Webb&#10;Space Telescope (JWST) for the near&#45; and mid&#45;infrared. The aim is to expand&#10;this set in the future. Third, these models can be integrated with various&#10;inference and optimization schemes, such as maximum a posteriori estimation and&#10;variational inference. Explicit demos show how to integrate the individual&#10;modules into a full analysis pipeline. Overall, J&#45;UBIK enables efficient&#10;generation of high&#45;fidelity images via Bayesian pipelines that can be tailored&#10;to specific research objectives.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10381v1) |&#10;| Thermolectricity in irradiated bilayer graphene flakes | Cynthia Ihuoma Osuala, Tanu Choudhary, Raju K. Biswas, Sudin Ganguly, Chunlei Qu, Santanu K. Maiti | &#160;&#160;We present a comprehensive study on enhancing the thermoelectric (TE)&#10;performance of bilayer graphene (BLG) through irradiation with arbitrarily&#10;polarized light, focusing on $AA$&#45; and $AB$&#45;stacked configurations with zigzag&#10;edges. Utilizing a combination of tight&#45;binding theory and density functional&#10;theory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on&#10;electronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the&#10;electronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function,&#10;which significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the&#10;overall {it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT&#10;calculations reveal that $AB$&#45;stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal&#10;conductivity compared to $AA$&#45;stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic&#10;scattering and phonon group velocity. The combined analysis shows that FOM&#10;exceeds unity in both stacking types, with notable improvements near the&#10;irradiation&#45;induced gap. Additionally, we explore the dependence of FOM on the&#10;system dimensions and temperature, demonstrating that light&#45;irradiated BLG&#10;holds great promise for efficient thermoelectric energy conversion and waste&#10;heat recovery. Our results show favorable responses over a wide range of&#10;irradiation parameters. These findings provide crucial insights into optimizing&#10;BLG for advanced TE applications through light&#45;induced modifications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10380v1) |&#10;| Leveraging Joint Spectral and Spatial Learning with MAMBA for&#10; &#160;Multichannel Speech Enhancement | Wenze Ren, Haibin Wu, Yi&#45;Cheng Lin, Xuanjun Chen, Rong Chao, Kuo&#45;Hsuan Hung, You&#45;Jin Li, Wen&#45;Yuan Ting, Hsin&#45;Min Wang, Yu Tsao | &#160;&#160;In multichannel speech enhancement, effectively capturing spatial and&#10;spectral information across different microphones is crucial for noise&#10;reduction. Traditional methods, such as CNN or LSTM, attempt to model the&#10;temporal dynamics of full&#45;band and sub&#45;band spectral and spatial features.&#10;However, these approaches face limitations in fully modeling complex temporal&#10;dependencies, especially in dynamic acoustic environments. To overcome these&#10;challenges, we modify the current advanced model McNet by introducing an&#10;improved version of Mamba, a state&#45;space model, and further propose MCMamba.&#10;MCMamba has been completely reengineered to integrate full&#45;band and narrow&#45;band&#10;spatial information with sub&#45;band and full&#45;band spectral features, providing a&#10;more comprehensive approach to modeling spatial and spectral information. Our&#10;experimental results demonstrate that MCMamba significantly improves the&#10;modeling of spatial and spectral features in multichannel speech enhancement,&#10;outperforming McNet and achieving state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art performance on the CHiME&#45;3&#10;dataset. Additionally, we find that Mamba performs exceptionally well in&#10;modeling spectral information.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10376v1) |&#10;| Nonlinear Causality in Brain Networks: With Application to Motor Imagery&#10; &#160;vs Execution | Sipan Aslan, Hernando Ombao | &#160;&#160;One fundamental challenge of data&#45;driven analysis in neuroscience is modeling&#10;causal interactions and exploring the connectivity of nodes in a brain network.&#10;Various statistical methods, relying on various perspectives and employing&#10;different data modalities, are being developed to examine and comprehend the&#10;underlying causal structures inherent to brain dynamics. This study introduces&#10;a novel statistical approach, TAR4C, to dissect causal interactions in&#10;multichannel EEG recordings. TAR4C uses the threshold autoregressive model to&#10;describe the causal interaction between nodes or clusters of nodes in a brain&#10;network. The perspective involves testing whether one node, which may represent&#10;a brain region, can control the dynamics of the other. The node that has such&#10;an impact on the other is called a threshold variable and can be classified as&#10;a causative because its functionality is the leading source operating as an&#10;instantaneous switching mechanism that regulates the time&#45;varying&#10;autoregressive structure of the other. This statistical concept is commonly&#10;referred to as threshold non&#45;linearity. Once threshold non&#45;linearity has been&#10;verified between a pair of nodes, the subsequent essential facet of TAR&#10;modeling is to assess the predictive ability of the causal node for the current&#10;activity on the other and represent causal interactions in autoregressive&#10;terms. This predictive ability is what underlies Granger causality. The TAR4C&#10;approach can discover non&#45;linear and time&#45;dependent causal interactions without&#10;negating the G&#45;causality perspective. The efficacy of the proposed approach is&#10;exemplified by analyzing the EEG signals recorded during the motor&#10;movement/imagery experiment. The similarities and differences between the&#10;causal interactions manifesting during the execution and the imagery of a given&#10;motor movement are demonstrated by analyzing EEG recordings from multiple&#10;subjects.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10374v1) |&#10;| Instigating Cooperation among LLM Agents Using Adaptive Information&#10; &#160;Modulation | Qiliang Chen, &#160;Alireza, &#160;Ilami, Nunzio Lore, Babak Heydari | &#160;&#160;This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for&#10;human strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these&#10;agents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments. Our&#10;approach extends traditional agent&#45;based simulations by using strategic LLM&#10;agents (SLA) and introducing dynamic and adaptive governance through a&#10;pro&#45;social promoting RL agent (PPA) that modulates information access across&#10;agents in a network, optimizing social welfare and promoting pro&#45;social&#10;behavior. Through validation in iterative games, including the prisoner&#10;dilemma, we demonstrate that SLA agents exhibit nuanced strategic adaptations.&#10;The PPA agent effectively learns to adjust information transparency, resulting&#10;in enhanced cooperation rates. This framework offers significant insights into&#10;AI&#45;mediated social dynamics, contributing to the deployment of AI in real&#45;world&#10;team settings.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10372v1) |&#10;| Learning Gentle Grasping from Human&#45;Free Force Control Demonstration | Mingxuan Li, Lunwei Zhang, Tiemin Li, Yao Jiang | &#160;&#160;Humans can steadily and gently grasp unfamiliar objects based on tactile&#10;perception. Robots still face challenges in achieving similar performance due&#10;to the difficulty of learning accurate grasp&#45;force predictions and force&#10;control strategies that can be generalized from limited data. In this article,&#10;we propose an approach for learning grasping from ideal force control&#10;demonstrations, to achieve similar performance of human hands with limited data&#10;size. Our approach utilizes objects with known contact characteristics to&#10;automatically generate reference force curves without human demonstrations. In&#10;addition, we design the dual convolutional neural networks (Dual&#45;CNN)&#10;architecture which incorporating a physics&#45;based mechanics module for learning&#10;target grasping force predictions from demonstrations. The described method can&#10;be effectively applied in vision&#45;based tactile sensors and enables gentle and&#10;stable grasping of objects from the ground. The described prediction model and&#10;grasping strategy were validated in offline evaluations and online experiments,&#10;and the accuracy and generalizability were demonstrated.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10371v1) |&#10;| Uncovering the Mechanism of Hepatotoxiciy of PFAS Targeting L&#45;FABP Using&#10; &#160;GCN and Computational Modeling | Lucas Jividen, Tibo Duran, Xi&#45;Zhi Niu, Jun Bai | &#160;&#160;Per&#45; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental&#10;pollutants with known toxicity and bioaccumulation issues. Their widespread&#10;industrial use and resistance to degradation have led to global environmental&#10;contamination and significant health concerns. While a minority of PFAS have&#10;been extensively studied, the toxicity of many PFAS remains poorly understood&#10;due to limited direct toxicological data. This study advances the predictive&#10;modeling of PFAS toxicity by combining semi&#45;supervised graph convolutional&#10;networks (GCNs) with molecular descriptors and fingerprints. We propose a novel&#10;approach to enhance the prediction of PFAS binding affinities by isolating&#10;molecular fingerprints to construct graphs where then descriptors are set as&#10;the node features. This approach specifically captures the structural,&#10;physicochemical, and topological features of PFAS without overfitting due to an&#10;abundance of features. Unsupervised clustering then identifies representative&#10;compounds for detailed binding studies. Our results provide a more accurate&#10;ability to estimate PFAS hepatotoxicity to provide guidance in chemical&#10;discovery of new PFAS and the development of new safety regulations.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10370v1) |&#10;| Stochastic Control of UAVs: An Optimal Tradeoff between Performance,&#10; &#160;Flight Smoothness and Control Effort | George Rapakoulias, Panagiotis Tsiotras | &#160;&#160;Safe and accurate control of unmanned aerial vehicles in the presence of&#10;winds is a challenging control problem due to the hard&#45;to&#45;model and highly&#10;stochastic nature of the disturbance forces acting upon the vehicle. To meet&#10;performance constraints, state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art control methods such as Incremental&#10;Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) or other adaptive control techniques require&#10;high control gains to mitigate the effects of uncertainty entering the system.&#10;While achieving good tracking performance, IDNI requires excessive control&#10;effort, results in high actuator strain, and reduced flight smoothness due to&#10;constant and aggressive corrective actions commanded by the controller. In this&#10;paper, we propose a novel control architecture that allows the user to&#10;systematically address the trade&#45;off between high authority control and&#10;performance constraint satisfaction. Our approach consists of two parts. To&#10;cancel out biases introduced by unmodelled aerodynamic effects we propose a&#10;hybrid, model&#45;based disturbance force estimator augmented with a neural&#10;network, that can adapt to external wind conditions using a Kalman Filter. We&#10;then utilize state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art results from Covariance Steering theory, which&#10;offers a principled way of controlling the uncertainty of the tracking error&#10;dynamics. We first analyze the properties of the combined system and then&#10;provide extensive experimental results to verify the advantages of the proposed&#10;approach over existing methods&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10369v1) |&#10;| Integrated nowcasting of convective precipitation with Transformer&#45;based&#10; &#160;models using multi&#45;source data | Çağlar Küçük, Aitor Atencia, Markus Dabernig | &#160;&#160;Precipitation nowcasting is crucial for mitigating the impacts of severe&#10;weather events and supporting daily activities. Conventional models&#10;predominantly relying on radar data have limited performance in predicting&#10;cases with complex temporal features such as convection initiation,&#10;highlighting the need to integrate data from other sources for more&#10;comprehensive nowcasting. Unlike physics&#45;based models, machine learning&#10;(ML)&#45;based models offer promising solutions for efficiently integrating large&#10;volumes of diverse data. We present EF4INCA, a spatiotemporal Transformer model&#10;for precipitation nowcasting that integrates satellite&#45; and ground&#45;based&#10;observations with numerical weather prediction outputs. EF4INCA provides&#10;high&#45;resolution forecasts over Austria, accurately predicting the location and&#10;shape of precipitation fields with a spatial resolution of 1 kilometre and a&#10;temporal resolution of 5 minutes, up to 90 minutes ahead. Our evaluation shows&#10;that EF4INCA outperforms conventional nowcasting models, including the&#10;operational model of Austria, particularly in scenarios with complex temporal&#10;features such as convective initiation and rapid weather changes. EF4INCA&#10;maintains higher accuracy in location forecasting but generates smoother fields&#10;at later prediction times compared to traditional models. Interpretation of our&#10;model showed that precipitation products and SEVIRI infrared channels CH7 and&#10;CH9 are the most important data streams. These results underscore the&#10;importance of combining data from different domains, including physics&#45;based&#10;model products, with ML approaches. Our study highlights the robustness of&#10;EF4INCA and its potential for improved precipitation nowcasting. We provide&#10;access to our code repository, model weights, and the dataset curated for&#10;benchmarking, facilitating further development and application.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10367v1) |&#10;&#10;">

Hill, Matthias Kluge, Martin Landriau, Ximena Mazzalay, Eva Noyola, Taniya Parikh, Jan Snigula | &#160;&#160;We analyse the stellar structure of a sample of dwarf ellipticals (dE)&#10;inhabiting various environments within the Virgo cluster. Integral&#45;field&#10;observations with a high spectral resolution allow us to robustly determine&#10;their low velocity dispersions ($sim25$ km s$^{&#45;1}$) and higher&#45;order&#10;kinematic moments out to the half&#45;light radius. We find the dEs exhibit a&#10;diversity in ages with the younger dEs being less enhanced than the older,&#10;suggesting a complex star formation history for those dEs that recently entered&#10;Virgo while others have been quenched shortly after reionization.&#10;Orbit&#45;superposition modeling allowed us to recover viewing angles, stellar&#10;mass&#45;to&#45;light ratios (with gradients), as well as the intrinsic orbit&#10;structure. We find that the angular momentum of the dEs is strongly suppressed&#10;compared to ordinary early&#45;type galaxies and correlates with the environment.&#10;Flattened dEs are so because of a suppressed kinetic energy perpendicular to&#10;their equatorial plane. Combining population and dynamical modeling results, we&#10;find an age&#45;dependent stellar initial mass function (IMF) or, alternatively,&#10;evidence for a more extended star formation history for those galaxies that&#10;have had higher initial mass and/or inhabited lower density environments. dEs&#10;appear to have a spatially homogeneous stellar structure but the state they&#10;were `frozen&#39; in as they stopped forming stars varies dramatically according to&#10;their initial conditions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10518v1) |&#10;| RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long&#45;Context LLM Inference via Vector&#10; &#160;Retrieval | Di Liu, Meng Chen, Baotong Lu, Huiqiang Jiang, Zhenhua Han, Qianxi Zhang, Qi Chen, Chengruidong Zhang, Bailu Ding, Kai Zhang, Chen Chen, Fan Yang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu | &#160;&#160;Transformer&#45;based large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly important&#10;in various domains. However, the quadratic time complexity of attention&#10;operation poses a significant challenge for scaling to longer contexts due to&#10;the extremely high inference latency and GPU memory consumption for caching&#10;key&#45;value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training&#45;free&#10;approach to accelerate attention computation. To leverage the dynamic sparse&#10;property of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor&#10;search (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most&#10;relevant ones via vector search during generation. Due to the&#10;out&#45;of&#45;distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors, off&#45;the&#45;shelf&#10;ANNS indexes still need to scan O(N) (usually 30% of all keys) data for&#10;accurate retrieval, which fails to exploit the high sparsity.&#10;RetrievalAttention first identifies the OOD challenge of ANNS&#45;based attention,&#10;and addresses it via an attention&#45;aware vector search algorithm that can adapt&#10;to queries and only access 1&#45;&#45;3% of data, thus achieving a sub&#45;linear time&#10;complexity. RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of&#10;long&#45;context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the&#10;model accuracy. Especially, RetrievalAttention only needs 16GB GPU memory for&#10;serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating&#10;one token in 0.188 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB).&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516v1) |&#10;| An Efficient Self&#45;Learning Framework For Interactive Spoken Dialog&#10; &#160;Systems | Hitesh Tulsiani, David M. Chan, Shalini Ghosh, Garima Lalwani, Prabhat Pandey, Ankish Bansal, Sri Garimella, Ariya Rastrow, Björn Hoffmeister | &#160;&#160;Dialog systems, such as voice assistants, are expected to engage with users&#10;in complex, evolving conversations. Unfortunately, traditional automatic speech&#10;recognition (ASR) systems deployed in such applications are usually trained to&#10;recognize each turn independently and lack the ability to adapt to the&#10;conversational context or incorporate user feedback. In this work, we introduce&#10;a general framework for ASR in dialog systems that can go beyond learning from&#10;single&#45;turn utterances and learn over time how to adapt to both explicit&#10;supervision and implicit user feedback present in multi&#45;turn conversations. We&#10;accomplish that by leveraging advances in student&#45;teacher learning and&#10;context&#45;aware dialog processing, and designing contrastive self&#45;supervision&#10;approaches with Ohm, a new online hard&#45;negative mining approach. We show that&#10;leveraging our new framework compared to traditional training leads to relative&#10;WER reductions of close to 10% in real&#45;world dialog systems, and up to 26% on&#10;public synthetic data.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10515v1) |&#10;| Constraints on axions from patchy screening of the cosmic microwave&#10; &#160;background | Samuel Goldstein, Fiona McCarthy, Cristina Mondino, J. Colin Hill, Junwu Huang, Matthew C. Johnson | &#160;&#160;The resonant conversion of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons into&#10;axions within large&#45;scale structure induces an anisotropic spectral distortion&#10;in CMB temperature maps. Applying state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art foreground cleaning&#10;techniques to $textit{Planck}$ CMB observations, we construct maps of&#10;axion&#45;induced &quot;patchy screening&quot; of the CMB. We cross&#45;correlate these maps with&#10;data from the $textit{unWISE}$ galaxy survey and find no evidence of axions.&#10;We constrain the axion&#45;photon coupling, $g_{agammagamma} &#10;esssim 2 times&#10;10^{&#45;12}~{&#13;m GeV}^{&#45;1}$, at the 95% confidence level for axion masses in the&#10;range $10^{&#45;13}~{&#13;m eV} &#10;esssim m_a &#10;esssim 10^{&#45;12}~{&#13;m eV}$. These&#10;constraints are competitive with the tightest astrophysical axion limits in&#10;this mass range and are inferred from robust population&#45;level statistics, which&#10;makes them complementary to existing searches that rely on modeling of&#10;individual systems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10514v1) |&#10;| Weak Superimposed Codes of Improved Asymptotic Rate and Their Randomized&#10; &#160;Construction | Yu Tsunoda, Yuichiro Fujiwara | &#160;&#160;Weak superimposed codes are combinatorial structures related closely to&#10;generalized cover&#45;free families, superimposed codes, and disjunct matrices in&#10;that they are only required to satisfy similar but less stringent conditions.&#10;This class of codes may also be seen as a stricter variant of what are known as&#10;locally thin families in combinatorics. Originally, weak superimposed codes&#10;were introduced in the context of multimedia content protection against illegal&#10;distribution of copies under the assumption that a coalition of malicious users&#10;may employ the averaging attack with adversarial noise. As in many other kinds&#10;of codes in information theory, it is of interest and importance in the study&#10;of weak superimposed codes to find the highest achievable rate in the&#10;asymptotic regime and give an efficient construction that produces an infinite&#10;sequence of codes that achieve it. Here, we prove a tighter lower bound than&#10;the sharpest known one on the rate of optimal weak superimposed codes and give&#10;a polynomial&#45;time randomized construction algorithm for codes that&#10;asymptotically attain our improved bound with high probability. Our&#10;probabilistic approach is versatile and applicable to many other related codes&#10;and arrays.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10511v1) |&#10;| Pennsieve &#45; A Collaborative Platform for Translational Neuroscience and&#10; &#160;Beyond | Zack Goldblum, Zhongchuan Xu, Haoer Shi, Patryk Orzechowski, Jamaal Spence, Kathryn A Davis, Brian Litt, Nishant Sinha, Joost Wagenaar | &#160;&#160;The exponential growth of neuroscientific data necessitates platforms that&#10;facilitate data management and multidisciplinary collaboration.

Specifically, we investigate the role of resistivity&#10;in the dynamical evolution of neutron stars over a period of up to 100 ms and&#10;its effects on their quasi&#45;equilibrium configurations. Our results demonstrate&#10;that resistivity can significantly influence the development of&#10;magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, resulting in markedly different magnetic&#10;field geometries. Additionally, resistivity suppresses the growth of these&#10;instabilities, leading to a reduction in the amplitude of emitted gravitational&#10;waves. Despite the variations in magnetic field geometries, the ratio of&#10;poloidal to toroidal field energies remains consistently 9:1 throughout the&#10;simulations, for the models we investigated.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10508v1) |&#10;| Beth&#45;Uhlenbeck equation for the thermodynamics of fluctuations in a&#10; &#160;generalised 2+1D Gross&#45;Neveu model | Biplab Mahato, David Blaschke, Dietmar Ebert | &#160;&#160;We study a generalised version of Gross&#45;Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions. The&#10;model is inspired from graphene which shows a linear dispersion relation near&#10;the Dirac points. The phase structure and the thermodynamic properties in the&#10;mean field approximation have been studied before. Here we go beyond the mean&#10;field level by deriving a Beth&#45;Uhlenbeck equation for Gaussian fluctuations,&#10;solutions of which we explore numerically, for the first time including their&#10;momentum dependence. We discuss the excitonic mass, fluctuation pressure and&#10;phase shifts. We also perform a comparison with the NJL model in 3+1 dimension&#10;and discuss its implication for graphene.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10507v1) |&#10;| Context&#45;aware Code Segmentation for C&#45;to&#45;Rust Translation using Large&#10; &#160;Language Models | Momoko Shiraishi, Takahiro Shinagawa | &#160;&#160;There is strong motivation to translate C code into Rust code due to the&#10;continuing threat of memory safety vulnerabilities in existing C programs and&#10;the significant attention paid to Rust as an alternative to the C language.&#10;While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating this translation&#10;by generating more natural and safer code than rule&#45;based methods, previous&#10;studies have shown that LLM&#45;generated Rust code often fails to compile, even&#10;for relatively small C programs, due to significant differences between the two&#10;languages and context window limitations. We propose an LLM&#45;based translation&#10;scheme that improves the success rate of translating large&#45;scale C code into&#10;compilable Rust code. Our approach involves three key techniques: (1)&#10;pre&#45;processing the C code to better align its structure and expressions with&#10;Rust, (2) segmenting the code into optimally sized translation units to avoid&#10;exceeding the LLM&#39;s context window limits, and (3) iteratively compiling and&#10;repairing errors while maintaining consistency between translation units using&#10;context&#45;supplementing prompts. Compilation success is an essential first step&#10;in achieving functional equivalence, as only compilable code can be further&#10;tested. In experiments with 20 benchmark C programs, including those exceeding&#10;4 kilo lines of code, we successfully translated all programs into compilable&#10;Rust code without losing corresponding parts of the original code.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10506v1) |&#10;| Machine Learning Optimization of non&#45;Kasha Behavior and of Transient&#10; &#160;Dynamics in Model Retinal Isomerization | Davinder Singh, Chern Chuang, Paul Brumer | &#160;&#160;Designing a model of retinal isomerization in Rhodopsin, the first step in&#10;vision, that accounts for both experimental transient and stationary state&#10;observables is challenging. Here, multi&#45;objective Bayesian optimization is&#10;employed to refine the parameters of a minimal two&#45;state&#45;two&#45;mode (TM) model&#10;describing the photoisomerization of retinal in Rhodopsin. With an appropriate&#10;selection of objectives, the optimized retinal model predicts excitation&#10;wavelength&#45;dependent fluorescence spectra that closely align with&#10;experimentally observed non&#45;Kasha behavior in the non&#45;equilibrium steady state.&#10;Further, adjustments to the potential energy surface within the TM model reduce&#10;the discrepancies across the time domain. Overall, agreement with experimental&#10;data is excellent.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10505v1) |&#10;| DILA: Dictionary Label Attention for Mechanistic Interpretability in&#10; &#160;High&#45;dimensional Multi&#45;label Medical Coding Prediction | John Wu, David Wu, Jimeng Sun | &#160;&#160;Predicting high&#45;dimensional or extreme multilabels, such as in medical&#10;coding, requires both accuracy and interpretability. Existing works often rely&#10;on local interpretability methods, failing to provide comprehensive&#10;explanations of the overall mechanism behind each label prediction within a&#10;multilabel set. We propose a mechanistic interpretability module called&#10;DIctionary Label Attention (method) that disentangles uninterpretable dense&#10;embeddings into a sparse embedding space, where each nonzero element (a&#10;dictionary feature) represents a globally learned medical concept. Through&#10;human evaluations, we show that our sparse embeddings are more human&#10;understandable than its dense counterparts by at least 50 percent. Our&#10;automated dictionary feature identification pipeline, leveraging large language&#10;models (LLMs), uncovers thousands of learned medical concepts by examining and&#10;summarizing the highest activating tokens for each dictionary feature. We&#10;represent the relationships between dictionary features and medical codes&#10;through a sparse interpretable matrix, enhancing the mechanistic and global&#10;understanding of the model&#39;s predictions while maintaining competitive&#10;performance and scalability without extensive human annotation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10504v1) |&#10;| Causal Language Modeling Can Elicit Search and Reasoning Capabilities on&#10; &#160;Logic Puzzles | Kulin Shah, Nishanth Dikkala, Xin Wang, Rina Panigrahy | &#160;&#160;Causal language modeling using the Transformer architecture has yielded&#10;remarkable capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) over the last few&#10;years. However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning&#10;capabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this&#10;work, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as&#10;solving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to&#10;search over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then&#10;apply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the&#10;application of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in&#10;a cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases,&#10;multiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We&#10;observe that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn&#10;to solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21%$ of the puzzles fully correctly)&#10;when trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that&#10;training Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and&#10;without such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis&#10;to Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves&#10;$92.04 %$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal&#10;representations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear&#10;probing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any&#10;given cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine&#10;implicit in the Transformer weights.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10502v1) |&#10;| Alignment with nonlinear velocity couplings: collision&#45;avoidance and&#10; &#160;micro&#45;to&#45;macro mean&#45;field limits | Young&#45;Pil Choi, Michał Fabisiak, Jan Peszek | &#160;&#160;We investigate the pressureless fractional Euler&#45;alignment system with&#10;nonlinear velocity couplings, referred to as the $p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system.&#10;This model features a nonlinear velocity alignment force, interpreted as a&#10;density&#45;weighted fractional $p$&#45;Laplacian when the singularity parameter&#10;$alpha$ exceeds the spatial dimension $d$. Our primary goal is to establish&#10;the existence of solutions for strongly singular interactions ($alpha ge d$)&#10;and compactly supported initial conditions. We construct solutions as&#10;mean&#45;field limits of empirical measures from a kinetic variant of the&#10;$p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system. Specifically, we show that a sequence of empirical&#10;measures converges to a finite Radon measure, whose local density and velocity&#10;satisfy the $p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system. Our results are the first to prove the&#10;existence of solutions to this system in multi&#45;dimensional settings without&#10;significant initial data restrictions, covering both nonlinear ($p&gt;2$) and&#10;linear ($p=2$) cases. Additionally, we establish global existence, uniqueness,&#10;and collision avoidance for the corresponding particle ODE system under&#10;non&#45;collisional initial conditions, extending previous results for $1 &#10;e p &#10;e&#10;alpha + 2$. This analysis supports our mean&#45;field limit argument and&#10;contributes to understanding alignment models with singular communication.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10501v1) |&#10;| Focus diverse phase retrieval test results on broadband continuous&#10; &#160;wavefront sensing in space telescope applications | Hyukmo Kang, Kyle Van Gorkom, Meghdoot Biswas, Daewook Kim, Ewan S. Douglas | &#160;&#160;Continuous wavefront sensing benefits space observatories in on&#45;orbit optical&#10;performance maintenance. To measure the phase of a wavefront, phase retrieval&#10;is an attractive technique as it uses multiple point spread function (PSF)&#10;images that are acquired by the telescope itself without extra metrology&#10;systems nor complicated calibration. The focus diverse phase retrieval utilizes&#10;PSFs from predetermined defocused positions to enhance the dynamic range of the&#10;algorithm. We describe an updated visible light active optics testbed with the&#10;addition of a linear motorized focus stage. The performance of the phase&#10;retrieval algorithm in broadband is tested under various cases. While broadband&#10;pass filters have advantages in higher signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio (SNR), the&#10;performance of phase retrieval can be restricted due to blurred image caused by&#10;diffraction and increased computing cost. We used multiple bandpass filters (10&#10;nm, 88 nm, and 150 nm) and investigated effects of bandwidth on the accuracy&#10;and required image acquisition conditions such as SNR, reaching accuracies&#10;below 20 nm RMS wavefront error at the widest bandwidth. We also investigated&#10;the dynamic range of the phase retrieval algorithm depending on the bandwidth&#10;and required amount of defocus to expand dynamic range. Finally, we simulated&#10;the continuous wavefront sensing and correction loop with a range of&#10;statistically generated representative telescope disturbance time series to&#10;test for edge cases.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10500v1) |&#10;| The role of higher&#45;order terms in trapped&#45;ion quantum computing with&#10; &#160;magnetic gradient induced coupling | Sebastian Nagies, Kevin T. Geier, Javed Akram, Junichi Okamoto, Dimitris Badounas, Christof Wunderlich, Michael Johanning, Philipp Hauke | &#160;&#160;Trapped&#45;ion hardware based on the Magnetic Gradient Induced Coupling (MAGIC)&#10;scheme is emerging as a promising platform for quantum computing. Nevertheless,&#10;in this (as in any other) quantum&#45;computing platform, many technical questions&#10;still have to be resolved before large&#45;scale and error&#45;tolerant applications&#10;are possible. In this work, we present a thorough discussion of the&#10;contribution of higher&#45;order terms to the MAGIC setup, which can occur due to&#10;anharmonicities in the external potential of the ion crystal (e.g., through&#10;Coulomb repulsion) or through curvature of the applied magnetic field. These&#10;terms take the form of three&#45;spin couplings as well as diverse terms that&#10;couple spins to phonons. We find that most of these are negligible in realistic&#10;situations, with only two contributions that need careful attention. First,&#10;there are parasitic longitudinal fields whose strength increases with chain&#10;length, but which can easily be compensated by a microwave detuning. Second,&#10;anharmonicities of the Coulomb interaction can lead to well&#45;known two&#45;to&#45;one&#10;conversions of phonon excitations, which can be avoided if the phonons are&#10;ground&#45;state cooled. Our detailed analysis constitutes an important&#10;contribution on the way of making magnetic&#45;gradient trapped&#45;ion quantum&#10;technology fit for large&#45;scale applications, and it may inspire new ways to&#10;purposefully design interaction terms.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10498v1) |&#10;| MusicLIME: Explainable Multimodal Music Understanding | Theodoros Sotirou, Vassilis Lyberatos, Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Stamou | &#160;&#160;Multimodal models are critical for music understanding tasks, as they capture&#10;the complex interplay between audio and lyrics.

Most current recommender systems provide&#10;recommendations using conventional methods such as collaborative or&#10;content&#45;based filtering. Diffusion is a new approach to generative AI that&#10;improves on previous generative AI approaches such as Variational Autoencoders&#10;(VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We incorporate diffusion in&#10;a recommender system that mirrors the sequence users take when browsing and&#10;rating items. Although a few current recommender systems incorporate diffusion,&#10;they do not incorporate classifier&#45;free guidance, a new innovation in diffusion&#10;models as a whole. In this paper, we present a diffusion recommender system&#10;that augments the underlying recommender system model for improved performance&#10;and also incorporates classifier&#45;free guidance. Our findings show improvements&#10;over state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art recommender systems for most metrics for several&#10;recommendation tasks on a variety of datasets.

We&#10;find that for the same parameter count, the STU and its variants outperform the&#10;Transformer as well as other leading state space models across various&#10;modalities.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10489v1) |&#10;| Do Pre&#45;trained Vision&#45;Language Models Encode Object States? | Kaleb Newman, Shijie Wang, Yuan Zang, David Heffren, Chen Sun | &#160;&#160;For a vision&#45;language model (VLM) to understand the physical world, such as&#10;cause and effect, a first step is to capture the temporal dynamics of the&#10;visual world, for example how the physical states of objects evolve over time&#10;(e.g. a whole apple into a sliced apple). Our paper aims to investigate if VLMs&#10;pre&#45;trained on web&#45;scale data learn to encode object states, which can be&#10;extracted with zero&#45;shot text prompts. We curate an object state recognition&#10;dataset ChangeIt&#45;Frames, and evaluate nine open&#45;source VLMs, including models&#10;trained with contrastive and generative objectives. We observe that while these&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art vision&#45;language models can reliably perform object&#10;recognition, they consistently fail to accurately distinguish the objects&#39;&#10;physical states. Through extensive experiments, we identify three areas for&#10;improvements for VLMs to better encode object states, namely the quality of&#10;object localization, the architecture to bind concepts to objects, and the&#10;objective to learn discriminative visual and language encoders on object&#10;states. Data and code are released.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10488v1) |&#10;| A Host Galaxy Morphology Link Between Quasi&#45;Periodic Eruptions and Tidal&#10; &#160;Disruption Events | Olivier Gilbert, John J. Ruan, Michael Eracleous, Daryl Haggard, Jessie C. Runnoe | &#160;&#160;The physical processes that produce X&#45;ray Quasi&#45;Periodic Eruptions (QPEs)&#10;recently discovered from the nuclei of several low&#45;redshift galaxies are&#10;mysterious. Several pieces of observational evidence strongly suggest a link&#10;between QPEs and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE). Previous studies also reveal&#10;that the morphologies of TDE host galaxies are highly concentrated, with high&#10;Sersic indicies, bulge&#45;to&#45;total light (B/T) ratios, and stellar surface mass&#10;densities relative to the broader galaxy population. We use these distinctive&#10;properties to test the link between QPEs and TDEs, by comparing these&#10;parameters of QPE host galaxies to TDE host galaxies. We employ archival Legacy&#10;Survey images of a sample of 9 QPE host galaxies and a sample of 13 TDE host&#10;galaxies, and model their surface brightness profiles. We show that QPE host&#10;galaxies have high Sersic indices of ~3, high B/T ratios of ~0.5, and high&#10;surface mass densities of ~10^10 Msun kpc^&#45;2. These properties are similar to&#10;TDE host galaxies, but are in strong contrast to a mass&#45; and redshift&#45;matched&#10;control sample of galaxies. We also find tentative evidence that the central&#10;black holes in both QPE and TDE host galaxies are undermassive relative to&#10;their stellar mass. The morphological similarities between QPE and TDE host&#10;galaxies at the population level add to the mounting evidence of a physical&#10;link between these phenomena, and favor QPE models that also invoke TDEs.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10486v1) |&#10;| Tuning the Rate of Tightly Packed Systems To Produce Planet Occurrence&#10; &#160;Trends with Galactic Height | Sarah Ballard | &#160;&#160;The formation of planetary systems has historically been considered in&#10;isolation, decoupled from processes on galactic scales. Recent findings&#10;employing data from ESA&#39;s Gaia mission challenge this narrative, identifying&#10;trends in planet occurrence with galactic kinematics and stellar age. The&#10;findings indicate changes in planet occurrence over and above the predicted&#10;changes from metallicity variation within the Milky Way, so that changes to&#10;stellar metallicity alone (long understood to be deterministic in planet&#10;outcomes) cannot explain the trends entirely. The scope of potential factors&#10;influencing planet formation has grown progressively wider, with accompanying&#10;theoretical support for galactic&#45;scale influences upon planet formation. In&#10;this manuscript, we investigate specifically how changes to the rate of Systems&#10;of Tightly&#45;packed Inner Planets (STIPs) could manifest as a trend in planet&#10;occurrence with galactic height. We focus our study upon M dwarf planetary&#10;systems for two reasons: first, they host STIPs at high rates, and secondly,&#10;their longevity makes them useful probes for kinematic trends over Gyr. We&#10;consider two models for a varying STIP rate: one in which STIP likelihood is&#10;determined by stellar age alone, irrespective of galactic time, and another in&#10;which the STIP likelihood suddenly increased in recent galactic history. Both&#10;models, which impose a higher STIP likelihood among younger stars, produce a&#10;negative gradient in planet occurrence with increasing height from the galactic&#10;midplane. We find that a step function model in which STIP likelihood increased&#10;by a factor of several ~a few Gyr ago resembles an observed trend among FGK&#10;dwarfs. We consider plausible physical mechanisms that could mimic the&#10;hypothesized model, given known links between STIP occurrence and other stellar&#10;and planetary properties.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10485v1) |&#10;| XLM for Autonomous Driving Systems: A Comprehensive Review | Sonda Fourati, Wael Jaafar, Noura Baccar, Safwan Alfattani | &#160;&#160;Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable proficiency in various&#10;information&#45;processing tasks. These tasks span from extracting data and&#10;summarizing literature to generating content, predictive modeling,&#10;decision&#45;making, and system controls. Moreover, Vision Large Models (VLMs) and&#10;Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which represent the next generation of language&#10;models, a.k.a., XLMs, can combine and integrate many data modalities with the&#10;strength of language understanding, thus advancing several information&#45;based&#10;systems, such as Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). Indeed, by combining&#10;language communication with multimodal sensory inputs, e.g., panoramic images&#10;and LiDAR or radar data, accurate driving actions can be taken. In this&#10;context, we provide in this survey paper a comprehensive overview of the&#10;potential of XLMs towards achieving autonomous driving. Specifically, we review&#10;the relevant literature on ADS and XLMs, including their architectures, tools,&#10;and frameworks. Then, we detail the proposed approaches to deploy XLMs for&#10;autonomous driving solutions. Finally, we provide the related challenges to XLM&#10;deployment for ADS and point to future research directions aiming to enable XLM&#10;adoption in future ADS frameworks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10484v1) |&#10;| Efficient polarizable QM/MM using the direct reaction field Hamiltonian&#10; &#160;with electrostatic potential fitted multipole operators | Thomas P. Fay, Nicolas Ferré, Miquel Huix&#45;Rotllant | &#160;&#160;Electronic polarization and dispersion are decisive actors in determining&#10;interaction energies between molecules. These interactions have a particularly&#10;profound effect on excitation energies of molecules in complex environments,&#10;especially when the excitation involves a significant degree of charge&#10;reorganisation. The direct reaction field (DRF) approach, which has seen a&#10;recent revival of interest, provides a powerful framework for describing these&#10;interactions in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models of&#10;systems, where a small subsystem of interest is described using quantum&#10;chemical methods and the remainder is treated with a simple MM force field. In&#10;this paper we show how the DRF approach can be combined with the electrostatic&#10;potential fitted (ESPF) multipole operator description of the QM region charge&#10;density, which reduces the scaling $mathcal{O}(N_mathrm{MM}^3)$ of the method&#10;with MM system to $mathcal{O}(N_mathrm{MM}^2)$. We also show how the DRF&#10;approach can be combined with fluctuating charge descriptions of the&#10;polarizable environment, as well as previously used atom&#45;centred&#10;dipole&#45;polarizability based models. We further show that the ESPF&#45;DRF method&#10;provides an accurate description of molecular interactions in both ground and&#10;excited electronic states of the QM system and apply it to predict the gas to&#10;aqueous solution solvatochromic shifts in the UV/visible absorption spectrum of&#10;acrolein.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10483v1) |&#10;| Schrodinger&#39;s Memory: Large Language Models | Wei Wang, Qing Li | &#160;&#160;Memory is the foundation of LLMs&#39; functionality, yet past research has lacked&#10;an in&#45;depth exploration of their memory capabilities and underlying theory. In&#10;this paper, we apply UAT theory to explain the memory mechanism of LLMs and&#10;propose a new approach for evaluating LLM performance by comparing the memory&#10;capacities of different models. Through extensive experiments, we validate our&#10;theory and the memory abilities of LLMs. Finally, we compare the capabilities&#10;of the human brain and LLMs, highlighting both their similarities and&#10;differences in terms of working mechanisms.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10482v1) |&#10;| Exploring 3D Face Reconstruction and Fusion Methods for Face&#10; &#160;Verification: A Case&#45;Study in Video Surveillance | Simone Maurizio La Cava, Sara Concas, Ruben Tolosana, Roberto Casula, Giulia Orrù, Martin Drahansky, Julian Fierrez, Gian Luca Marcialis | &#160;&#160;3D face reconstruction (3DFR) algorithms are based on specific assumptions&#10;tailored to distinct application scenarios. These assumptions limit their use&#10;when acquisition conditions, such as the subject&#39;s distance from the camera or&#10;the camera&#39;s characteristics, are different than expected, as typically happens&#10;in video surveillance. Additionally, 3DFR algorithms follow various strategies&#10;to address the reconstruction of a 3D shape from 2D data, such as statistical&#10;model fitting, photometric stereo, or deep learning. In the present study, we&#10;explore the application of three 3DFR algorithms representative of the SOTA,&#10;employing each one as the template set generator for a face verification&#10;system. The scores provided by each system are combined by score&#45;level fusion.&#10;We show that the complementarity induced by different 3DFR algorithms improves&#10;performance when tests are conducted at never&#45;seen&#45;before distances from the&#10;camera and camera characteristics (cross&#45;distance and cross&#45;camera settings),&#10;thus encouraging further investigations on multiple 3DFR&#45;based approaches.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10481v1) |&#10;| Addressing misspecification in contextual optimization | Omar Bennouna, Jiawei Zhang, Saurabh Amin, Asuman Ozdaglar | &#160;&#160;We study a linear contextual optimization problem where a decision maker has&#10;access to historical data and contextual features to learn a cost prediction&#10;model aimed at minimizing decision error. We adopt the predict&#45;then&#45;optimize&#10;framework for this analysis. Given that perfect model alignment with reality is&#10;often unrealistic in practice, we focus on scenarios where the chosen&#10;hypothesis set is misspecified. In this context, it remains unclear whether&#10;current contextual optimization approaches can effectively address such model&#10;misspecification. In this paper, we present a novel integrated learning and&#10;optimization approach designed to tackle model misspecification in contextual&#10;optimization. This approach offers theoretical generalizability, tractability,&#10;and optimality guarantees, along with strong practical performance. Our method&#10;involves minimizing a tractable surrogate loss that aligns with the performance&#10;value from cost vector predictions, regardless of whether the model&#10;misspecified or not, and can be optimized in reasonable time. To our knowledge,&#10;no previous work has provided an approach with such guarantees in the context&#10;of model misspecification.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10479v1) |&#10;| Local SGD for Near&#45;Quadratic Problems: Improving Convergence under&#10; &#160;Unconstrained Noise Conditions | Andrey Sadchikov, Savelii Chezhegov, Aleksandr Beznosikov, Alexander Gasnikov | &#160;&#160;Distributed optimization plays an important role in modern large&#45;scale&#10;machine learning and data processing systems by optimizing the utilization of&#10;computational resources. One of the classical and popular approaches is Local&#10;Stochastic Gradient Descent (Local SGD), characterized by multiple local&#10;updates before averaging, which is particularly useful in distributed&#10;environments to reduce communication bottlenecks and improve scalability. A&#10;typical feature of this method is the dependence on the frequency of&#10;communications. But in the case of a quadratic target function with homogeneous&#10;data distribution over all devices, the influence of frequency of&#10;communications vanishes. As a natural consequence, subsequent studies include&#10;the assumption of a Lipschitz Hessian, as this indicates the similarity of the&#10;optimized function to a quadratic one to some extent. However, in order to&#10;extend the completeness of the Local SGD theory and unlock its potential, in&#10;this paper we abandon the Lipschitz Hessian assumption by introducing a new&#10;concept of $textit{approximate quadraticity}$. This assumption gives a new&#10;perspective on problems that have near quadratic properties. In addition,&#10;existing theoretical analyses of Local SGD often assume bounded variance. We,&#10;in turn, consider the unbounded noise condition, which allows us to broaden the&#10;class of studied problems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10478v1) |&#10;| SimInversion: A Simple Framework for Inversion&#45;Based Text&#45;to&#45;Image&#10; &#160;Editing | Qi Qian, Haiyang Xu, Ming Yan, Juhua Hu | &#160;&#160;Diffusion models demonstrate impressive image generation performance with&#10;text guidance. Inspired by the learning process of diffusion, existing images&#10;can be edited according to text by DDIM inversion. However, the vanilla DDIM&#10;inversion is not optimized for classifier&#45;free guidance and the accumulated&#10;error will result in the undesired performance. While many algorithms are&#10;developed to improve the framework of DDIM inversion for editing, in this work,&#10;we investigate the approximation error in DDIM inversion and propose to&#10;disentangle the guidance scale for the source and target branches to reduce the&#10;error while keeping the original framework. Moreover, a better guidance scale&#10;(i.e., 0.5) than default settings can be derived theoretically. Experiments on&#10;PIE&#45;Bench show that our proposal can improve the performance of DDIM inversion&#10;dramatically without sacrificing efficiency.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10476v1) |&#10;| Leadership and Engagement Dynamics in Legislative Twitter Networks:&#10; &#160;Statistical Analysis and Modeling | Carolina Luque, Juan Sosa | &#160;&#160;In this manuscript, we analyze the interaction network on Twitter among&#10;members of the 117th U.S. Congress to assess the visibility of political&#10;leaders and explore how systemic properties and node attributes influence the&#10;formation of legislative connections. We employ descriptive social network&#10;statistical methods, the exponential random graph model (ERGM), and the&#10;stochastic block model (SBM) to evaluate the relative impact of network&#10;systemic properties, as well as institutional and personal traits, on the&#10;generation of online relationships among legislators. Our findings reveal that&#10;legislative networks on social media platforms like Twitter tend to reinforce&#10;the leadership of dominant political actors rather than diminishing their&#10;influence. However, we identify that these leadership roles can manifest in&#10;various forms. Additionally, we highlight that online connections within&#10;legislative networks are influenced by both the systemic properties of the&#10;network and institutional characteristics.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10475v1) |&#10;| MacDiff: Unified Skeleton Modeling with Masked Conditional Diffusion | Lehong Wu, Lilang Lin, Jiahang Zhang, Yiyang Ma, Jiaying Liu | &#160;&#160;Self&#45;supervised learning has proved effective for skeleton&#45;based human action&#10;understanding. However, previous works either rely on contrastive learning that&#10;suffers false negative problems or are based on reconstruction that learns too&#10;much unessential low&#45;level clues, leading to limited representations for&#10;downstream tasks. Recently, great advances have been made in generative&#10;learning, which is naturally a challenging yet meaningful pretext task to model&#10;the general underlying data distributions. However, the representation learning&#10;capacity of generative models is under&#45;explored, especially for the skeletons&#10;with spacial sparsity and temporal redundancy. To this end, we propose Masked&#10;Conditional Diffusion (MacDiff) as a unified framework for human skeleton&#10;modeling. For the first time, we leverage diffusion models as effective&#10;skeleton representation learners. Specifically, we train a diffusion decoder&#10;conditioned on the representations extracted by a semantic encoder. Random&#10;masking is applied to encoder inputs to introduce a information bottleneck and&#10;remove redundancy of skeletons. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that&#10;our generative objective involves the contrastive learning objective which&#10;aligns the masked and noisy views. Meanwhile, it also enforces the&#10;representation to complement for the noisy view, leading to better&#10;generalization performance. MacDiff achieves state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art performance on&#10;representation learning benchmarks while maintaining the competence for&#10;generative tasks. Moreover, we leverage the diffusion model for data&#10;augmentation, significantly enhancing the fine&#45;tuning performance in scenarios&#10;with scarce labeled data.

Hassan | &#160;&#160;The proliferation of open Pre&#45;trained Language Models (PTLMs) on model&#10;registry platforms like Hugging Face (HF) presents both opportunities and&#10;challenges for companies building products around them. Similar to traditional&#10;software dependencies, PTLMs continue to evolve after a release. However, the&#10;current state of release practices of PTLMs on model registry platforms are&#10;plagued by a variety of inconsistencies, such as ambiguous naming conventions&#10;and inaccessible model training documentation. Given the knowledge gap on&#10;current PTLM release practices, our empirical study uses a mixed&#45;methods&#10;approach to analyze the releases of 52,227 PTLMs on the most well&#45;known model&#10;registry, HF. Our results reveal 148 different naming practices for PTLM&#10;releases, with 40.87% of changes to model weight files not represented in the&#10;adopted name&#45;based versioning practice or their documentation. In addition, we&#10;identified that the 52,227 PTLMs are derived from only 299 different base&#10;models (the modified original models used to create 52,227 PTLMs), with&#10;Fine&#45;tuning and Quantization being the most prevalent modification methods&#10;applied to these base models. Significant gaps in release transparency, in&#10;terms of training dataset specifications and model card availability, still&#10;exist, highlighting the need for standardized documentation. While we&#10;identified a model naming practice explicitly differentiating between major and&#10;minor PTLM releases, we did not find any significant difference in the types of&#10;changes that went into either type of releases, suggesting that major/minor&#10;version numbers for PTLMs often are chosen arbitrarily. Our findings provide&#10;valuable insights to improve PTLM release practices, nudging the field towards&#10;more formal semantic versioning practices.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10472v1) |&#10;| Real&#45;Time Whole&#45;Body Control of Legged Robots with Model&#45;Predictive Path&#10; &#160;Integral Control | Juan Alvarez&#45;Padilla, John Z.

F. Lizarraga, Flavia M. D. Marquitti, Marcus A. M. de Aguiar | &#160;&#160;We investigate the role of assortative mating in speciation using the&#10;sympatric model of Derrida and Higgs. The model explores the idea that genetic&#10;differences create incompatibilities between individuals, preventing mating if&#10;the number of such differences is too large. Speciation, however, only happens&#10;in this mating system if the number of genes is large. Here we show that&#10;speciation with small genome sizes can occur if assortative mating is&#10;introduced. In our model individuals are represented by three chromosomes: one&#10;responsible for reproductive compatibility, one for coding the trait on which&#10;assortativity will operate, and a neutral chromosome. Reproduction is possible&#10;if individuals are genetically similar with respect to the first chromosome,&#10;but among these compatible mating partners, the one with the most similar trait&#10;coded by the second chromosome is selected. We show that this type of&#10;assortativity facilitates speciation, which can happen with a small number of&#10;genes in the first chromosome. Species, classified according to reproductive&#10;isolation, dictated by the first chromosome, can display different traits&#10;values, as measured by the second and the third chromosomes. Therefore, species&#10;can also be identified based on similarity of the neutral trait, which works as&#10;a proxy for reproductive isolation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10466v1) |&#10;| A stabilized total pressure&#45;formulation of the Biot&#39;s poroelasticity&#10; &#160;equations in frequency domain: numerical analysis and applications | Cristian Cárcamo, Alfonso Caiazzo, Felipe Galarce, Joaquín Mura | &#160;&#160;This work focuses on the numerical solution of the dynamics of a poroelastic&#10;material in the frequency domain. We provide a detailed stability analysis&#10;based on the application of the Fredholm alternative in the continuous case,&#10;considering a total pressure formulation of the Biot&#39;s equations. In the&#10;discrete setting, we propose a stabilized equal order finite element method&#10;complemented by an additional pressure stabilization to enhance the robustness&#10;of the numerical scheme with respect to the fluid permeability. Utilizing the&#10;Fredholm alternative, we extend the well&#45;posedness results to the discrete&#10;setting, obtaining theoretical optimal convergence for the case of linear&#10;finite elements. We present different numerical experiments to validate the&#10;proposed method. First, we consider model problems with known analytic&#10;solutions in two and three dimensions. As next, we show that the method is&#10;robust for a wide range of permeabilities, including the case of discontinuous&#10;coefficients. Lastly, we show the application for the simulation of brain&#10;elastography on a realistic brain geometry obtained from medical imaging.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10465v1) |&#10;| New Direct Sum Tests | Alek Westover, Edward Yu, Kai Zheng | &#160;&#160;A function $f:[n]^{d} to mathbb{F}_2$ is a defn{direct sum} if there are&#10;functions $L_i:[n]to mathbb{F}_2$ such that ${f(x) = sum_{i}L_i(x_i)}$. In&#10;this work we give multiple results related to the property testing of direct&#10;sums.&#10; &#160;Our first result concerns a test proposed by Dinur and Golubev in 2019. We&#10;call their test the Diamond test and show that it is indeed a direct sum&#10;tester. More specifically, we show that if a function $f$ is $epsilon$&#45;far&#10;from being a direct sum function, then the Diamond test rejects $f$ with&#10;probability at least $Omega_{n,epsilon}(1)$. Even in the case of $n = 2$, the&#10;Diamond test is, to the best of our knowledge, novel and yields a new tester&#10;for the classic property of affinity.&#10; &#160;Apart from the Diamond test, we also analyze a broad family of direct sum&#10;tests, which at a high level, run an arbitrary affinity test on the restriction&#10;of $f$ to a random hypercube inside of $[n]^d$. This family of tests includes&#10;the direct sum test analyzed in cite{di19}, but does not include the Diamond&#10;test. As an application of our result, we obtain a direct sum test which works&#10;in the online adversary model of cite{KRV}.&#10; &#160;Finally, we also discuss a Fourier analytic interpretation of the diamond&#10;tester in the $n=2$ case, as well as prove local correction results for direct&#10;sum as conjectured by Dinur and Golubev.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10464v1) |&#10;| Kolmogorov&#45;Arnold Networks in Low&#45;Data Regimes: A Comparative Study with&#10; &#160;Multilayer Perceptrons | Farhad Pourkamali&#45;Anaraki | &#160;&#160;Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) have long been a cornerstone in deep learning,&#10;known for their capacity to model complex relationships. Recently,&#10;Kolmogorov&#45;Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a compelling alternative,&#10;utilizing highly flexible learnable activation functions directly on network&#10;edges, a departure from the neuron&#45;centric approach of MLPs. However, KANs&#10;significantly increase the number of learnable parameters, raising concerns&#10;about their effectiveness in data&#45;scarce environments. This paper presents a&#10;comprehensive comparative study of MLPs and KANs from both algorithmic and&#10;experimental perspectives, with a focus on low&#45;data regimes. We introduce an&#10;effective technique for designing MLPs with unique, parameterized activation&#10;functions for each neuron, enabling a more balanced comparison with KANs. Using&#10;empirical evaluations on simulated data and two real&#45;world data sets from&#10;medicine and engineering, we explore the trade&#45;offs between model complexity&#10;and accuracy, with particular attention to the role of network depth. Our&#10;findings show that MLPs with individualized activation functions achieve&#10;significantly higher predictive accuracy with only a modest increase in&#10;parameters, especially when the sample size is limited to around one hundred.&#10;For example, in a three&#45;class classification problem within additive&#10;manufacturing, MLPs achieve a median accuracy of 0.91, significantly&#10;outperforming KANs, which only reach a median accuracy of 0.53 with default&#10;hyperparameters. These results offer valuable insights into the impact of&#10;activation function selection in neural networks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10463v1) |&#10;| Effects of synapse location, delay and background stochastic activity on&#10; &#160;synchronising hippocampal CA1 neurons | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore | &#160;&#160;We study the synchronisation of neurons in a realistic model under the&#10;Hodgkin&#45;Huxley dynamics. To focus on the role of the different locations of the&#10;excitatory synapses, we use two identical neurons where the set of input&#10;signals is grouped at two different distances from the soma. The system is&#10;intended to represent a CA1 hippocampal neuron in which the synapses arriving&#10;from the CA3 neurons of the trisynaptic pathway appear to be localised in the&#10;apical dendritic region and are, in principle, either proximal or distal to the&#10;soma. Synchronisation is studied using a specifically defined spiking&#10;correlation function as a function of various parameters such as the distance&#10;from the soma of one of the synaptic groups, the inhibition weight and the&#10;associated activation delay. We found that the neurons&#39; spiking activity&#10;depends nonmonotonically on the relative dendritic location of the synapses and&#10;their inhibitory weight, whereas the synchronisation measure always decreases&#10;with inhibition, and strongly depends on its activation time delay. The&#10;background activity on the somas results essentially independent on the&#10;fluctuation intensity and strongly support the importance of the balance&#10;between inhibition and excitation for neuronal synchronization.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10460v1) |&#10;| Efficiently Crowdsourcing Visual Importance with Punch&#45;Hole Annotation | Minsuk Chang, Soohyun Lee, Aeri Cho, Hyeon Jeon, Seokhyeon Park, Cindy Xiong Bearfield, Jinwook Seo | &#160;&#160;We introduce a novel crowdsourcing method for identifying important areas in&#10;graphical images through punch&#45;hole labeling. Traditional methods, such as gaze&#10;trackers and mouse&#45;based annotations, which generate continuous data, can be&#10;impractical in crowdsourcing scenarios. They require many participants, and the&#10;outcome data can be noisy. In contrast, our method first segments the graphical&#10;image with a grid and drops a portion of the patches (punch holes). Then, we&#10;iteratively ask the labeler to validate each annotation with holes, narrowing&#10;down the annotation only having the most important area. This approach aims to&#10;reduce annotation noise in crowdsourcing by standardizing the annotations while&#10;enhancing labeling efficiency and reliability. Preliminary findings from&#10;fundamental charts demonstrate that punch&#45;hole labeling can effectively&#10;pinpoint critical regions. This also highlights its potential for broader&#10;application in visualization research, particularly in studying large&#45;scale&#10;users&#39; graphical perception. Our future work aims to enhance the algorithm to&#10;achieve faster labeling speed and prove its utility through large&#45;scale&#10;experiments.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10459v1) |&#10;| Full distribution of local observables in an exactly solvable current&#10; &#160;carrying steady states of a driven XXZ chain | Sandipan Manna, G J Sreejith | &#160;&#160;Current carrying steady states of interacting spins chains exhibit rich&#10;structures generated through an interplay of current induced correlations and&#10;energetic constraints from the Hamiltonian. The XXZ spin chain when coupled to&#10;maximally polarizing Lindblad terms admits an exact solution in a matrix&#10;product state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations&#10;and distributions of simple local spin observables in the non equilibrium&#10;steady state (NESS). We present exact expressions for spin correlators, entropy&#10;per site, cumulant generating functions for distributions of local observables&#10;in the XX limit (Ising anisotropy $Delta=0$). Further, we use the exact MPS&#10;solution in systems with $Delta&gt;0$, to numerically exactly calculate the&#10;entropy, correlations, as well as distributions of spin observables in blocks&#10;as large as $nsim 200$ sites allowing an estimation of the rate functions. The&#10;$z$ magnetization distribution is consistant with short range spin correlations&#10;in the $z$ direction while the $x$&#45;magnetization shows a double peak structure&#10;at larger $Delta$ suggesting short range ferromagnetic ordering. We find that&#10;the distribution of $z$&#45;magnetization sharpens for parameters where the current&#10;is maximized.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10458v1) |&#10;| Mean Residual Life Ageing Intensity Function | Ashutosh Singh, Ishapathik Das, Asok Kumar Nanda, Sumen Sen | &#160;&#160;The ageing intensity function is a powerful analytical tool that provides&#10;valuable insights into the ageing process across diverse domains such as&#10;reliability engineering, actuarial science, and healthcare. Its applications&#10;continue to expand as researchers delve deeper into understanding the complex&#10;dynamics of ageing and its implications for society. One common approach to&#10;defining the ageing intensity function is through the hazard rate or failure&#10;rate function, extensively explored in scholarly literature. Equally&#10;significant to the hazard rate function is the mean residual life function,&#10;which plays a crucial role in analyzing the ageing patterns exhibited by units&#10;or components. This article introduces the mean residual life ageing intensity&#10;(MRLAI) function to delve into component ageing behaviours across various&#10;distributions. Additionally, we scrutinize the closure properties of the MRLAI&#10;function across different reliability operations. Furthermore, a new order&#10;termed the mean residual life ageing intensity order is defined to analyze the&#10;ageing behaviour of a system, and the closure property of this order under&#10;various reliability operations is discussed.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10456v1) |&#10;| Quantile Fourier regressions for decision making under uncertainty | Arash Khojaste, Geoffrey Pritchard, Golbon Zakeri | &#160;&#160;Weconsider Markov decision processes arising from a Markov model of an&#10;underlying natural phenomenon. Such phenomena are usually periodic (e.g.&#10;annual) in time, and so the Markov processes modelling them must be&#10;time&#45;inhomogeneous, with cyclostationary rather than stationary behaviour. We&#10;describe a technique for constructing such processes that allows for periodic&#10;variations both in the values taken by the process and in the serial dependence&#10;structure. We include two illustrative numerical examples: a hydropower&#10;scheduling problem and a model of offshore wind power integration.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10455v1) |&#10;| The Debiased Near&#45;Earth Object Population from ATLAS Telescopes | Rogerio Deienno, Larry Denneau, David Nesvorný, David Vokrouhlický, William F. Bottke, Robert Jedicke, Shantanu Naidu, Steven R. Chesley, Davide Farnocchia, Paul W. Chodas | &#160;&#160;This work is dedicated to debias the Near&#45;Earth Objects (NEO) population&#10;based on observations from the Asteroid Terrestrial&#45;impact Last Alert System&#10;(ATLAS) telescopes. We have applied similar methods used to develop the&#10;recently released NEO model generator (NEOMOD), once debiasing the NEO&#10;population using data from Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) G96 telescope. ATLAS is&#10;composed of four different telescopes. We first analyzed observational data&#10;from each of all four telescopes separately and later combined them. Our&#10;results highlight main differences between CSS and ATLAS, e.g., sky coverage&#10;and survey power at debiasing the NEO population. ATLAS has a much larger sky&#10;coverage than CSS, allowing it to find bright NEOs that would be constantly&#10;&quot;hiding&quot; from CSS. Consequently, ATLAS is more powerful than CSS at debiasing&#10;the NEO population for H $&#10;esssim$ 19. With its intrinsically greater&#10;sensitivity and emphasis on observing near opposition, CSS excels in the&#10;debiasing of smaller objects. ATLAS, as an all sky survey designed to find&#10;imminent hazardous objects, necessarily spends a significant fraction of time&#10;looking at places on the sky where objects do not appear, reducing its power&#10;for debiasing the population of small objects. We estimate a NEO population&#10;completeness of $approx$ 88%$^{+3%}_{&#45;2%}$ for H $&lt;$ 17.75 and $approx$&#10;36%$^{+1%}_{&#45;1%}$ for H $&lt;$ 22.25. Those numbers are similar to previous&#10;estimates (within error bars for H $&lt;$ 17.75) from CSS, yet, around 3% and 8%&#10;smaller at their face values, respectively. We also confirm previous finding&#10;that the $&#10;u_6$ secular resonance is the main source of small and faint NEOs&#10;at H = 28, whereas the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter dominates for&#10;larger and brighter NEOs at H = 15.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10453v1) |&#10;| Signed Graph Autoencoder for Explainable and Polarization&#45;Aware Network&#10; &#160;Embeddings | Nikolaos Nakis, Chrysoula Kosma, Giannis Nikolentzos, Michalis Chatzianastasis, Iakovos Evdaimon, Michalis Vazirgiannis | &#160;&#160;Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant&#10;attention in recent years for their ability to extract informative latent&#10;representations, characterizing the structure of complex topologies, such as&#10;graphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited&#10;focus on developing and evaluating explainable neural&#45;based graph generative&#10;models specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we&#10;propose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE&#10;extracts node&#45;level representations that express node memberships over distinct&#10;extreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is&#10;achieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its&#10;polarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for&#10;analyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with&#10;relational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation&#10;demonstrates the SGAAEs&#39; capability to successfully infer node memberships over&#10;the different underlying latent structures while extracting competing&#10;communities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the&#10;network. Additionally, we introduce the 2&#45;level network polarization problem&#10;and show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model&#10;achieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across&#10;four real&#45;world datasets, outperforming several baseline models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10452v1) |&#10;| Why you should also use OLS estimation of tail exponents | Thiago Trafane Oliveira Santos, Daniel Oliveira Cajueiro | &#160;&#160;Even though practitioners often estimate Pareto exponents running OLS&#10;rank&#45;size regressions, the usual recommendation is to use the Hill MLE with a&#10;small&#45;sample correction instead, due to its unbiasedness and efficiency. In&#10;this paper, we advocate that you should also apply OLS in empirical&#10;applications. On the one hand, we demonstrate that, with a small&#45;sample&#10;correction, the OLS estimator is also unbiased. On the other hand, we show that&#10;the MLE assigns significantly greater weight to smaller observations. This&#10;suggests that the OLS estimator may outperform the MLE in cases where the&#10;distribution is (i) strictly Pareto but only in the upper tail or (ii)&#10;regularly varying rather than strictly Pareto. We substantiate our theoretical&#10;findings with Monte Carlo simulations and real&#45;world applications,&#10;demonstrating the practical relevance of the OLS method in estimating tail&#10;exponents.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10448v1) |&#10;| Hydrodynamic hovering of swimming bacteria above surfaces | Pyae Hein Htet, Debasish Das, Eric Lauga | &#160;&#160;Flagellated bacteria are hydrodynamically attracted to rigid walls, yet past&#10;work shows a &#39;hovering&#39; state where they swim stably at a finite height above&#10;surfaces. We use numerics and theory to reveal the physical origin of hovering.&#10;Simulations first show that hovering requires an elongated cell body and&#10;results from a tilt away from the wall. Theoretical models then identify two&#10;essential asymmetries: the response of width&#45;asymmetric cells to active flows&#10;created by length&#45;asymmetric cells. A minimal model reconciles near and&#10;far&#45;field hydrodynamics, capturing all key features of hovering.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10447v1) |&#10;| KoroT&#45;3E: A Personalized Musical Mnemonics Tool for Enhancing Memory&#10; &#160;Retention of Complex Computer Science Concepts | Xiangzhe Yuan, Jiajun Wang, Siying Hu, Andrew Cheung, Zhicong Lu | &#160;&#160;As the demand for computer science (CS) skills grows, mastering foundational&#10;concepts is crucial yet challenging for novice learners. To address this&#10;challenge, we present KoroT&#45;3E, an AI&#45;based system that creates personalized&#10;musical mnemonics to enhance both memory retention and understanding of&#10;concepts in CS. KoroT&#45;3E enables users to transform complex concepts into&#10;memorable lyrics and compose melodies that suit their musical preferences. We&#10;conducted semi&#45;structured interviews (n=12) to investigate why novice learners&#10;find it challenging to memorize and understand CS concepts. The findings,&#10;combined with constructivist learning theory, established our initial design,&#10;which was then refined following consultations with CS education experts. An&#10;empirical experiment(n=36) showed that those using KoroT&#45;3E (n=18)&#10;significantly outperformed the control group (n=18), with improved memory&#10;efficiency, increased motivation, and a positive learning experience. These&#10;findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating multimodal generative AI&#10;into CS education to create personalized and interactive learning experiences.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10446v1) |&#10;| Deep&#45;Wide Learning Assistance for Insect Pest Classification | Toan Nguyen, Huy Nguyen, Huy Ung, Hieu Ung, Binh Nguyen | &#160;&#160;Accurate insect pest recognition plays a critical role in agriculture. It is&#10;a challenging problem due to the intricate characteristics of insects. In this&#10;paper, we present DeWi, novel learning assistance for insect pest&#10;classification. With a one&#45;stage and alternating training strategy, DeWi&#10;simultaneously improves several Convolutional Neural Networks in two&#10;perspectives: discrimination (by optimizing a triplet margin loss in a&#10;supervised training manner) and generalization (via data augmentation). From&#10;that, DeWi can learn discriminative and in&#45;depth features of insect pests&#10;(deep) yet still generalize well to a large number of insect categories (wide).&#10;Experimental results show that DeWi achieves the highest performances on two&#10;insect pest classification benchmarks (76.44% accuracy on the IP102 dataset&#10;and 99.79% accuracy on the D0 dataset, respectively). In addition, extensive&#10;evaluations and ablation studies are conducted to thoroughly investigate our&#10;DeWi and demonstrate its superiority.

Behavior trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robot&#10;task planning for their modularity and flexibility, but manually designing them&#10;can be effort&#45;intensive. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been&#10;applied in robotic task planning for generating action sequences, but their&#10;ability to generate BTs has not been fully investigated. To this end, We&#10;propose LLM as BT&#45;planner, a novel framework to leverage LLMs for BT generation&#10;in robotic assembly task planning and execution. Four in&#45;context learning&#10;methods are introduced to utilize the natural language processing and inference&#10;capabilities of LLMs to produce task plans in BT format, reducing manual effort&#10;and ensuring robustness and comprehensibility. We also evaluate the performance&#10;of fine&#45;tuned, fewer&#45;parameter LLMs on the same tasks. Experiments in simulated&#10;and real&#45;world settings show that our framework enhances LLMs&#39; performance in&#10;BT generation, improving success rates in BT generation through in&#45;context&#10;learning and supervised fine&#45;tuning.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10444v1) |&#10;| The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration. II.&#10; &#160;Mid&#45;Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy | Karl D. Gordon, G. C. Sloan, Macarena Garcia Marin, Mattia Libralato, George Rieke, Jonathan A. Aguilar, Ralph Bohlin, Misty Cracraft, Marjorie Decleir, Andras Gaspar, David R. Law, Alberto Noriega&#45;Crespo, Michael Regan | &#160;&#160;The absolute flux calibration of the Mid&#45;Infrared Instrument Imaging and&#10;Coronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first&#10;2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the&#10;flux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays,&#10;and different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining&#10;observed aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions&#10;based on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of&#10;these observations were combined with model point&#45;spread&#45;functions to measure&#10;the corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with&#10;time, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time,&#10;rate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations&#10;were with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately&#10;every month revealed a modest time&#45;dependent response loss seen mainly at the&#10;longest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential&#10;with a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the&#10;band&#45;dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was&#10;found to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different&#10;subarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting&#10;for the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors&#10;measured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The&#10;formal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are&#10;0.3 to 1.0%, with longer&#45;wavelength bands generally having larger&#10;uncertainties.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10443v1) |&#10;| CtRNet&#45;X: Camera&#45;to&#45;Robot Pose Estimation in Real&#45;world Conditions Using&#10; &#160;a Single Camera | Jingpei Lu, Zekai Liang, Tristin Xie, Florian Ritcher, Shan Lin, Sainan Liu, Michael C. Yip | &#160;&#160;Camera&#45;to&#45;robot calibration is crucial for vision&#45;based robot control and&#10;requires effort to make it accurate. Recent advancements in markerless pose&#10;estimation methods have eliminated the need for time&#45;consuming physical setups&#10;for camera&#45;to&#45;robot calibration. While the existing markerless pose estimation&#10;methods have demonstrated impressive accuracy without the need for cumbersome&#10;setups, they rely on the assumption that all the robot joints are visible&#10;within the camera&#39;s field of view. However, in practice, robots usually move in&#10;and out of view, and some portion of the robot may stay out&#45;of&#45;frame during the&#10;whole manipulation task due to real&#45;world constraints, leading to a lack of&#10;sufficient visual features and subsequent failure of these approaches. To&#10;address this challenge and enhance the applicability to vision&#45;based robot&#10;control, we propose a novel framework capable of estimating the robot pose with&#10;partially visible robot manipulators. Our approach leverages the&#10;Vision&#45;Language Models for fine&#45;grained robot components detection, and&#10;integrates it into a keypoint&#45;based pose estimation network, which enables more&#10;robust performance in varied operational conditions. The framework is evaluated&#10;on both public robot datasets and self&#45;collected partial&#45;view datasets to&#10;demonstrate our robustness and generalizability. As a result, this method is&#10;effective for robot pose estimation in a wider range of real&#45;world manipulation&#10;scenarios.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10441v1) |&#10;| Successive topological phase transitions in two distinct spin&#45;flop&#10; &#160;phases on the honeycomb lattice | Xudong Li, Jize Zhao, Jinbin Li, Qiang Luo | &#160;&#160;The Kitaev magnets with bond&#45;dependent interactions have garnered&#10;considerable attention in recent years for their ability to harbor exotic&#10;phases and nontrivial excitations. The topological magnons, which are indicated&#10;by nonzero Chern number and thermal Hall conductivity, are proposed to&#10;partially explain thermal Hall measurements in real materials. Hitherto,&#10;topological magnons have been extensively explored when the magnetic field is&#10;normal to the honeycomb plane, but their topological characteristics are less&#10;studied in the presence of in&#45;plane magnetic field. Here, we study two distinct&#10;in&#45;plane field induced spin&#45;flop phases in the $Gamma$&#45;$Gamma&#39;$ model, both&#10;of which are off&#45;diagonal couplings that have intimate relation to the Kitaev&#10;interaction. The two spin&#45;flop phases are distinguished by their out&#45;of&#45;plane&#10;spin components which can be either antiparallel or parallel, thus dubbing&#10;antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) spin&#45;flop phases, respectively.&#10;We map out topological phase diagrams for both phases, revealing a rich pattern&#10;of the Chern number over exchange parameters and magnetic field. We&#10;analytically calculate the boundaries of topological phase transitions when the&#10;magnetic field is along the $a$ and $b$ directions. We find that the thermal&#10;Hall conductivity and its derivative display contrasting behaviors when&#10;crossing different topological phase transitions. The striking difference of&#10;the two phases lies in that when the magnetic field is along the $b$ direction,&#10;topological magnons are totally absent in the AFM spin&#45;flop phase, while they&#10;can survive in the FM analogue in certain parameter regions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10439v1) |&#10;| A functorial approach to $n$&#45;abelian categories | Vitor Gulisz | &#160;&#160;We develop a functorial approach to the study of $n$&#45;abelian categories by&#10;reformulating their axioms in terms of their categories of finitely presented&#10;functors. Such an approach allows the use of classical homological algebra and&#10;representation theory techniques to understand higher homological algebra.

We also specialize our results to modules&#10;over rings, thereby describing when the category of finitely generated&#10;projective modules over a ring is $n$&#45;abelian. Moreover, we establish a&#10;correspondence for $n$&#45;abelian categories with additive generators, which&#10;extends the higher Auslander correspondence.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10438v1) |&#10;| Color symmetry breaking in the Potts spin glass | Jean&#45;Christophe Mourrat | &#160;&#160;The Potts spin glass is an analogue of the Sherrington&#45;Kirkpatrick model in&#10;which each spin can take one of $kappa$ possible values, which we interpret as&#10;colors.

The vast majority of&#10;energy&#45;preserving reduced&#45;order methods use symplectic Galerkin projection to&#10;construct reduced&#45;order Hamiltonian models by projecting the full models onto a&#10;symplectic subspace. However, symplectic projection requires the existence of&#10;fully discrete operators, and in many cases, such as black&#45;box PDE solvers,&#10;these operators are inaccessible. In this work, we propose an energy&#45;preserving&#10;machine learning method that can infer the dynamics of the given PDE using data&#10;only, so that the proposed framework does not depend on the fully discrete&#10;operators. In this context, the proposed method is non&#45;intrusive. The proposed&#10;method is grey box in the sense that it requires only some basic knowledge of&#10;the multi&#45;symplectic model at the partial differential equation level. We prove&#10;that the proposed method satisfies spatially discrete local energy conservation&#10;and preserves the multi&#45;symplectic conservation laws. We test our method on the&#10;linear wave equation, the Korteweg&#45;de Vries equation, and the&#10;Zakharov&#45;Kuznetsov equation.

To&#10;focus on the role of different excitatory positions, we use two copies of the&#10;same neuron whose synapses are located at different distances from the soma and&#10;are exposed to identical Poissonian distributed current pulses. The&#10;synchronization is investigated through a specifically defined spiking&#10;correlation function, and its behavior is analyzed as a function of several&#10;parameters: inhibition weight, distance from the soma of one synaptic group,&#10;excitatory inactivation delay, and weight of the excitatory synapses.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10431v1) |&#10;| Meta&#45;Whisper: Speech&#45;Based Meta&#45;ICL for ASR on Low&#45;Resource Languages | Ming&#45;Hao Hsu, Kuan Po Huang, Hung&#45;yi Lee | &#160;&#160;This paper presents Meta&#45;Whisper, a novel approach to improve automatic&#10;speech recognition (ASR) for low&#45;resource languages using the Whisper model. By&#10;leveraging Meta In&#45;Context Learning (Meta&#45;ICL) and a k&#45;Nearest Neighbors (KNN)&#10;algorithm for sample selection, Meta&#45;Whisper enhances Whisper&#39;s ability to&#10;recognize speech in unfamiliar languages without extensive fine&#45;tuning.&#10;Experiments on the ML&#45;SUPERB dataset show that Meta&#45;Whisper significantly&#10;reduces the Character Error Rate (CER) for low&#45;resource languages compared to&#10;the original Whisper model. This method offers a promising solution for&#10;developing more adaptable multilingual ASR systems, particularly for languages&#10;with limited resources.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10429v1) |&#10;| User&#45;Authenticated Device&#45;Independent Quantum Secure Direct&#10; &#160;Communication Protocol | Nayana Das, Saikat Basu, Goutam Paul, Vijay S. Rao | &#160;&#160;Device&#45;Independent Quantum Secure Direct Communication (DI&#45;QSDC) enhances&#10;quantum cryptography by enabling secure message transmission without relying on&#10;the trustworthiness of the devices involved. This approach mitigates risks&#10;associated with compromised or untrusted devices, common in traditional quantum&#10;communication.&#10; &#160;In this paper, we propose the first of its kind DI&#45;QSDC protocol with user&#10;identity authentication. This ensures the authenticity of both the sender and&#10;receiver prior to message exchange. We then discuss the security of the&#10;proposed protocol against common attacks, demonstrating that no eavesdropper&#10;gains any information from either the quantum or the classical channel. Next,&#10;we implement the protocol on IBM&#39;s quantum hardware and evaluate its&#10;performance in a realistic noisy environment. Additionally, by simulating&#10;common attack models, we showcase that the protocol is secure against any&#10;eavesdropper in the channel. These findings highlight the protocol&#39;s robust&#10;security and practical feasibility for real&#45;world secure quantum communication.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10427v1) |&#10;| Role of kinematic constraints in the time reversal symmetry breaking of&#10; &#160;a model active matter | Soumen Das, Shankar Ghosh, Tridib Sadhu, Juliane U Klamser | &#160;&#160;Active&#45;matter systems are inherently out&#45;of&#45;equilibrium and perform&#10;mechanical work by utilizing their internal energy sources. Breakdown of&#10;time&#45;reversal symmetry (BTRS) is a hallmark of such dissipative non&#45;equilibrium&#10;dynamics. We introduce a robust, experimentally accessible, noninvasive,&#10;quantitative measure of BTRS in terms of the Kullback&#45;Leibler divergence in&#10;collision events, demonstrated in our novel artificial active matter, comprised&#10;of battery&#45;powered spherical rolling robots whose energetics in different modes&#10;of motion can be measured with high precision. Our dimensionless measure&#10;characterizes how dissipation and internal energetics are influenced by&#10;kinematic constraints from interactions with the environment. We propose this&#10;measure of BTRS as an empirical estimate of the distance from equilibrium. An&#10;energetic insight into this departure of active matter from equilibrium comes&#10;from our demonstration of a non&#45;trivial fluctuation symmetry, which reveals a&#10;potentially universal thermodynamic characteristic of active energetics. As a&#10;many&#45;body consequence of BTRS in our experimental active system, we demonstrate&#10;the emergence of activity&#45;induced herding, which has no equilibrium analogue.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10425v1) |&#10;| Unveiling V Modes: Enhancing CMB Sensitivity to BSM Physics with a&#10; &#160;Non&#45;Ideal Half&#45;Wave Plate | N. Raffuzzi, M. Lembo, S. Giardiello, M. Gerbino, M. Lattanzi, P. Natoli, L. Pagano | &#160;&#160;V&#45;mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background is expected to be&#10;vanishingly small in the $Lambda$CDM model and, hence, usually ignored.&#10;Nonetheless, several astrophysical effects, as well as beyond standard model&#10;physics could produce it at a detectable level. A realistic half&#45;wave plate &#45;&#10;an optical element commonly used in CMB experiments to modulate the polarized&#10;signal &#45; can provide sensitivity to V modes without significantly spoiling that&#10;to linear polarization. We assess this sensitivity for some new&#45;generation CMB&#10;experiments, such as the LiteBIRD satellite, the ground&#45;based Simons&#10;Observatory and a CMB&#45;S4&#45;like experiment. We forecast the efficiency of these&#10;experiments to constrain the phenomenology of certain classes of BSM models&#10;inducing mixing of linear polarization states and generation of V modes in the&#10;CMB. We find that new&#45;generation experiments can improve current limits by&#10;1&#45;to&#45;3 orders of magnitude, depending on the data combination. The inclusion of&#10;V&#45;mode information dramatically boosts the sensitivity to these BSM models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10424v1) |&#10;| Initial data for a deformed isolated horizon | Aleš Flandera, David Kofroň, Tomáš Ledvinka | &#160;&#160;Within the isolated horizon formalism, we investigate a static axisymmetric&#10;space&#45;time of a black hole influenced by matter in its neighborhood. To&#10;illustrate the role of ingredients and assumptions in this formalism, we first&#10;show how, in spherical symmetry, the field equations and gauge conditions imply&#10;the isolated horizon initial data leading to the Schwarzschild space&#45;time.&#10;Then, we construct the initial data for a static axisymmetric isolated horizon&#10;representing a deformed black hole. The space&#45;time description in the&#10;Bondi&#45;like coordinates is then found as a series expansion in the vicinity of&#10;the horizon. To graphically illustrate this construction, we also find a&#10;numerical solution for a black hole deformed by a particular analytic model of&#10;a thin accretion disk. We also discuss how an accretion disk affects the&#10;analytical properties of the horizon geometry.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10423v1) |&#10;| Learning Semi&#45;Supervised Medical Image Segmentation from Spatial&#10; &#160;Registration | Qianying Liu, Paul Henderson, Xiao Gu, Hang Dai, Fani Deligianni | &#160;&#160;Semi&#45;supervised medical image segmentation has shown promise in training&#10;models with limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. However,&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methods ignore a potentially valuable source of unsupervised&#10;semantic information &#45;&#45; spatial registration transforms between image volumes.&#10;To address this, we propose CCT&#45;R, a contrastive cross&#45;teaching framework&#10;incorporating registration information. To leverage the semantic information&#10;available in registrations between volume pairs, CCT&#45;R incorporates two&#10;proposed modules: Registration Supervision Loss (RSL) and Registration&#45;Enhanced&#10;Positive Sampling (REPS). The RSL leverages segmentation knowledge derived from&#10;transforms between labeled and unlabeled volume pairs, providing an additional&#10;source of pseudo&#45;labels. REPS enhances contrastive learning by identifying&#10;anatomically&#45;corresponding positives across volumes using registration&#10;transforms. Experimental results on two challenging medical segmentation&#10;benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CCT&#45;R across&#10;various semi&#45;supervised settings, with as few as one labeled case.

A number of recent methods have shown&#10;how to perform high&#45;dimensional, unbinned unfolding using machine learning.&#10;However, one of the assumptions in all of these methods is that the detector&#10;response is accurately modeled in the Monte Carlo simulation. In practice, the&#10;detector response depends on a number of nuisance parameters that can be&#10;constrained with data. We propose a new algorithm called Profile OmniFold&#10;(POF), which works in a similar iterative manner as the OmniFold (OF) algorithm&#10;while being able to simultaneously profile the nuisance parameters. We&#10;illustrate the method with a Gaussian example as a proof of concept&#10;highlighting its promising capabilities.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10421v1) |&#10;| HiFi&#45;CS: Towards Open Vocabulary Visual Grounding For Robotic Grasping&#10; &#160;Using Vision&#45;Language Models | Vineet Bhat, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Ramesh Karri, Farshad Khorrami | &#160;&#160;Robots interacting with humans through natural language can unlock numerous&#10;applications such as Referring Grasp Synthesis (RGS). Given a text query, RGS&#10;determines a stable grasp pose to manipulate the referred object in the robot&#39;s&#10;workspace. RGS comprises two steps: visual grounding and grasp pose estimation.&#10;Recent studies leverage powerful Vision&#45;Language Models (VLMs) for visually&#10;grounding free&#45;flowing natural language in real&#45;world robotic execution.&#10;However, comparisons in complex, cluttered environments with multiple instances&#10;of the same object are lacking. This paper introduces HiFi&#45;CS, featuring&#10;hierarchical application of Featurewise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to fuse image&#10;and text embeddings, enhancing visual grounding for complex attribute rich text&#10;queries encountered in robotic grasping. Visual grounding associates an object&#10;in 2D/3D space with natural language input and is studied in two scenarios:&#10;Closed and Open Vocabulary. HiFi&#45;CS features a lightweight decoder combined&#10;with a frozen VLM and outperforms competitive baselines in closed vocabulary&#10;settings while being 100x smaller in size. Our model can effectively guide&#10;open&#45;set object detectors like GroundedSAM to enhance open&#45;vocabulary&#10;performance. We validate our approach through real&#45;world RGS experiments using&#10;a 7&#45;DOF robotic arm, achieving 90.33% visual grounding accuracy in 15 tabletop&#10;scenes.

Papoutsis, I. E. Papadakis, C. Panagiotou, M. Dovčiak, E. Kammoun | &#160;&#160;Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to be variable across all&#10;wavelengths. Significant observational efforts have been invested in the last&#10;decade in studying their ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability. Long and&#10;densely sampled, multi&#45;wavelength monitoring campaigns of numerous Seyfert&#10;galaxies have been conducted with the aim of determining the X&#45;ray/UV/optical&#10;continuum time lags. Time&#45;lag studies can be used to constrain theoretical&#10;models. The observed time lags can be explained by thermal reprocessing of the&#10;X&#45;rays illuminating the accretion disc (known as the X&#45;ray reverberation&#10;model). However, the observed light curves contain more information that can be&#10;used to further constrain physical models. Our primary objective is to&#10;investigate whether, in addition to time lags, the X&#45;ray reverberation model&#10;can also explain the UV/optical variability amplitude of nearby Seyferts. To do&#10;this, we measured the excess variance of four sources (namely Mrk 509, NGC&#10;4151, NGC 2617, and Mrk 142) as a function of wavelength using data from&#10;archival long, multi&#45;wavelength campaigns with Swift, and ground&#45;based&#10;telescopes. We also computed the model excess variance in the case of the X&#45;ray&#10;reverberation model by determining the disc&#39;s transfer function and assuming a&#10;bending power law for the X&#45;ray power spectrum. We tested the validity of the&#10;model by comparing the measured and model variances for a range of accretion&#10;rates and X&#45;ray source heights. We conclude that the X&#45;ray thermal&#10;reverberation model can fit both the continuum, UV/optical time lags, as well&#10;as the variance in these AGNs, for the same physical parameters. Our results&#10;suggest that the accretion disc is constant and that all the observed&#10;UV/optical variations, on timescales of days and up to a few weeks, can be&#10;fully explained by the variable X&#45;rays as they illuminate the accretion disc.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10417v1) |&#10;| Local central limit theorem for Mallows measure | Alexey Bufetov, Kailun Chen | &#160;&#160;We study the statistics of the Mallows measure on permutations in the limit&#10;pioneered by Starr (2009).

We also re&#45;derive versions of the law of large numbers&#10;and the large deviation principle, obtain the standard central limit theorem&#10;from the local one, and establish a multi&#45;point version of the local central&#10;limit theorem.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10415v1) |&#10;| On interactive anisotropic walks in two dimensions generated from a&#10; &#160;three state opinion dynamics model | Surajit Saha, Parongama Sen | &#160;&#160;A system of interacting walkers on a two&#45;dimensional space where the dynamics&#10;of each walker are governed by the opinions of agents of a three&#45;state opinion&#10;dynamics model are considered. Such walks, inspired by Ising&#45;like models and&#10;opinions dynamics models, are usually considered in one&#45;dimensional virtual&#10;spaces. Here, the mapping is done in such a way that the walk is directed along&#10;the $y$ axis while it can move either way along the $x$ axis. We explore the&#10;properties of such walks as the parameter representing the noise in the opinion&#10;dynamics model, responsible for a continuous phase transition, is varied. The&#10;walk features show marked differences as the system crosses the critical point.&#10;The bivariate distribution of the displacements below the critical point is a&#10;modified biased Gaussian function of x and y which is symmetric about the X&#10;axis.&#10; &#160;The marginal probability distributions can be extracted and the scaling forms&#10;of different quantities, showing power law behaviour, are obtained. The&#10;directed nature of the walk is reflected in the marginal distributions as well&#10;as in the exponents.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10413v1) |&#10;| A Large&#45;Scale Privacy Assessment of Android Third&#45;Party SDKs | Mark Huasong Meng, Chuan Yan, Yun Hao, Qing Zhang, Zeyu Wang, Kailong Wang, Sin Gee Teo, Guangdong Bai, Jin Song Dong | &#160;&#160;Third&#45;party Software Development Kits (SDKs) are widely adopted in Android&#10;app development, to effortlessly accelerate development pipelines and enhance&#10;app functionality. However, this convenience raises substantial concerns about&#10;unauthorized access to users&#39; privacy&#45;sensitive information, which could be&#10;further abused for illegitimate purposes like user tracking or monetization.&#10;Our study offers a targeted analysis of user privacy protection among Android&#10;third&#45;party SDKs, filling a critical gap in the Android software supply chain.&#10;It focuses on two aspects of their privacy practices, including data&#10;exfiltration and behavior&#45;policy compliance (or privacy compliance), utilizing&#10;techniques of taint analysis and large language models. It covers 158&#10;widely&#45;used SDKs from two key SDK release platforms, the official one and a&#10;large alternative one. From them, we identified 338 instances of privacy data&#10;exfiltration. On the privacy compliance, our study reveals that more than 30%&#10;of the examined SDKs fail to provide a privacy policy to disclose their data&#10;handling practices. Among those that provide privacy policies, 37% of them&#10;over&#45;collect user data, and 88% falsely claim access to sensitive data. We&#10;revisit the latest versions of the SDKs after 12 months. Our analysis&#10;demonstrates a persistent lack of improvement in these concerning trends. Based&#10;on our findings, we propose three actionable recommendations to mitigate the&#10;privacy leakage risks and enhance privacy protection for Android users. Our&#10;research not only serves as an urgent call for industry attention but also&#10;provides crucial insights for future regulatory interventions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10411v1) |&#10;| A point process approach for the classification of noisy calcium imaging&#10; &#160;data | Arianna Burzacchi, Nicoletta D&#39;Angelo, David Payares&#45;Garcia, Jorge Mateu | &#160;&#160;We study noisy calcium imaging data, with a focus on the classification of&#10;spike traces. As raw traces obscure the true temporal structure of neuron&#39;s&#10;activity, we performed a tuned filtering of the calcium concentration using two&#10;methods: a biophysical model and a kernel mapping. The former characterizes&#10;spike trains related to a particular triggering event, while the latter filters&#10;out the signal and refines the selection of the underlying neuronal response.&#10;Transitioning from traditional time series analysis to point process theory,&#10;the study explores spike&#45;time distance metrics and point pattern prototypes to&#10;describe repeated observations. We assume that the analyzed neuron&#39;s firing&#10;events, i.e. spike occurrences, are temporal point process events. In&#10;particular, the study aims to categorize 47 point patterns by depth, assuming&#10;the similarity of spike occurrences within specific depth categories. The&#10;results highlight the pivotal roles of depth and stimuli in discerning diverse&#10;temporal structures of neuron firing events, confirming the point process&#10;approach based on prototype analysis is largely useful in the classification of&#10;spike traces.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10409v1) |&#10;| Variational closures for composite homogenised fluid flows | Theo Diamantakis, Ruiao Hu | &#160;&#160;The Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport is a variational formulation of&#10;stochastic fluid dynamics introduced to model the effects of unresolved scales,&#10;whilst preserving the geometric structure of ideal fluid flows. In this work,&#10;we show that the SALT equations can arise from the decomposition of the fluid&#10;flow map into its mean and fluctuating components. The fluctuating component is&#10;realised as a prescribed stochastic diffeomorphism that introduces stochastic&#10;transport into the system and we construct it using homogenisation theory. The&#10;dynamics of the mean component are derived from a variational principle&#10;utilising particular forms of variations that preserve the composite structure&#10;of the flow. Using a new variational principle, we show that SALT equations can&#10;arise from random Lagrangians and are equivalent to random coefficient PDEs. We&#10;also demonstrate how to modify the composite flow and the associated&#10;variational principle to derive models inspired by the Lagrangian Averaged&#10;Euler&#45;Poincare (LAEP) theory.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10408v1) |&#10;| Bitcoin Transaction Behavior Modeling Based on Balance Data | Yu Zhang, Claudio Tessone | &#160;&#160;When analyzing Bitcoin users&#39; balance distribution, we observed that it&#10;follows a log&#45;normal pattern. Drawing parallels from the successful application&#10;of Gibrat&#39;s law of proportional growth in explaining city size and word&#10;frequency distributions, we tested whether the same principle could account for&#10;the log&#45;normal distribution in Bitcoin balances. However, our calculations&#10;revealed that the exponent parameters in both the drift and variance terms&#10;deviate slightly from one. This suggests that Gibrat&#39;s proportional growth rule&#10;alone does not fully explain the log&#45;normal distribution observed in Bitcoin&#10;users&#39; balances. During our exploration, we discovered an intriguing&#10;phenomenon: Bitcoin users tend to fall into two distinct categories based on&#10;their behavior, which we refer to as ``poor&quot; and ``wealthy&quot; users. Poor users,&#10;who initially purchase only a small amount of Bitcoin, tend to buy more&#10;bitcoins first and then sell out all their holdings gradually over time. The&#10;certainty of selling all their coins is higher and higher with time. In&#10;contrast, wealthy users, who acquire a large amount of Bitcoin from the start,&#10;tend to sell off their holdings over time. The speed at which they sell their&#10;bitcoins is lower and lower over time and they will hold at least a small part&#10;of their initial holdings at last. Interestingly, the wealthier the user, the&#10;larger the proportion of their balance and the higher the certainty they tend&#10;to sell. This research provided an interesting perspective to explore bitcoin&#10;users&#39; behaviors which may apply to other finance markets.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10407v1) |&#10;| Stochastic Data&#45;Driven Predictive Control: Chance&#45;Constraint&#10; &#160;Satisfaction with Identified Multi&#45;step Predictors | Haldun Balim, Andrea Carron, Melanie N. Zeilinger, Johannes Köhler | &#160;&#160;We propose a novel data&#45;driven stochastic model predictive control framework&#10;for uncertain linear systems with noisy output measurements. Our approach&#10;leverages multi&#45;step predictors to efficiently propagate uncertainty, ensuring&#10;chance constraint satisfaction with minimal conservatism. In particular, we&#10;present a strategy to identify multi&#45;step predictors and quantify the&#10;associated uncertainty using a surrogate (data&#45;driven) state space model. Then,&#10;we utilize the derived distribution to formulate a constraint tightening that&#10;ensures chance constraint satisfaction. A numerical example highlights the&#10;reduced conservatism of handling parametric uncertainty in the proposed method&#10;compared to state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art solutions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10405v1) |&#10;| A Knowledge&#45;Enhanced Disease Diagnosis Method Based on Prompt Learning&#10; &#160;and BERT Integration | Zhang Zheng | &#160;&#160;This paper proposes a knowledge&#45;enhanced disease diagnosis method based on a&#10;prompt learning framework. The method retrieves structured knowledge from&#10;external knowledge graphs related to clinical cases, encodes it, and injects it&#10;into the prompt templates to enhance the language model&#39;s understanding and&#10;reasoning capabilities for the task.We conducted experiments on three public&#10;datasets: CHIP&#45;CTC, IMCS&#45;V2&#45;NER, and KUAKE&#45;QTR. The results show that the&#10;proposed method significantly outperforms existing models across multiple&#10;evaluation metrics, with an F1 score improvement of 2.4% on the CHIP&#45;CTC&#10;dataset, 3.1% on the IMCS&#45;V2&#45;NER dataset,and 4.2% on the KUAKE&#45;QTR dataset.&#10;Additionally,ablation studies confirmed the critical role of the knowledge&#10;injection module,as the removal of this module resulted in a significant drop&#10;in F1 score. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not&#10;only effectively improves the accuracy of disease diagnosis but also enhances&#10;the interpretability of the predictions, providing more reliable support and&#10;evidence for clinical diagnosis.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10403v1) |&#10;| A Statistical Equilibrium Approach to Adam Smith&#39;s Labor Theory of Value | Ellis Scharfenaker, Bruno Theodosio, Duncan K.

In meiosis II mouse oocytes (developing egg cells) awaiting&#10;fertilisation, the spindle, which is the protein structure responsible for&#10;dividing genetic material in a cell, must maintain its position near the cell&#10;cortex (the thin actin network bound to the cell membrane) for many hours.&#10;However, the cytoplasmic streaming that accompanies this stable positioning&#10;would intuitively appear to destabilise the spindle position. Here, through a&#10;combination of numerical and analytical modelling, we reveal a new,&#10;hydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning beneath the cortical cap.&#10;We show that this stability depends critically on the spindle size and the&#10;active driving from the cortex, and demonstrate that stable spindle positioning&#10;can result purely from a hydrodynamic suction force exerted on the spindle by&#10;the cytoplasmic flow. Our findings show that local fluid dynamic forces can be&#10;sufficient to stabilise the spindle, explaining robustness against&#10;perturbations not only perpendicular but also parallel to the cortex. Our&#10;results shed light on the importance of cytoplasmic streaming in mammalian&#10;meiosis.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10401v1) |&#10;| Sherpa: An Open Source Python Fitting Package | Aneta Siemiginowska, Douglas Burke, Hans Moritz Günther, Nicholas P.

Dejrah | &#160;&#160;We focus on the inflationary predictions of $beta$&#45;exponential potential&#10;models, in which the inflaton is a representation of the field delineating the&#10;size of extra&#45;dimension. Since it offers a well&#45;motivated starting point for&#10;the study of physics at very high energies, we incorporate an $R^2$ term in the&#10;Palatini gravity. In addition, afterward the inflation, the inflaton oscillates&#10;about the minimum of the inflation potential, and reheats the universe. This&#10;occurs during the reheating phase, at which the inflaton decays into the&#10;standard model particles, which fill the universe. We extend our examination by&#10;considering the reheating effects on inflationary observables by employing the&#10;different scenarios of the reheat temperature. Supposing the standard thermal&#10;history after inflation, we display the inflationary predictions, $n_s, r,&#10;mathrm{d}n_s/mathrm{d}&#10;n k$ of $beta$&#45;exponential potential with minimal&#10;coupling in Palatini $R^2$ gravity. Also, different kinds of constraints from a&#10;variety of observations, such as BICEP/Keck, Planck 2018, as well as future&#10;possible detectable sensitivities that might be reached by CMB experiments:&#10;CMB&#45;S4 and LiteBIRD are taken into account in this work. We indicate that our&#10;results are consistent with both the latest data and the future sensitivity&#10;forecasts of LiteBIRD/Planck and CMB&#45;S4. Finally, the results in this study&#10;highlight the viability of our model even in the case of the existence of more&#10;stringent constraints expected from future achievable confidence level limits.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10398v1) |&#10;| Quantifying Observational Projection Effects with a Simulation&#45;based hot&#10; &#160;CGM model | Soumya Shreeram, Johan Comparat, Andrea Merloni, Yi Zhang, Gabriele Ponti, Kirpal Nandra, John ZuHone, Ilaria Marini, Stephan Vladutescu&#45;Zopp, Paola Popesso, Ruediger Pakmor, Riccardo Seppi, Celine Peroux, Daniele Sorini | &#160;&#160;The hot phase of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) allows us to probe the&#10;inflow and outflow of gas within a galaxy, which is responsible for dictating&#10;the evolution of the galaxy. Studying the hot CGM sheds light on a better&#10;understanding of gas physics, which is crucial to inform and constrain&#10;simulation models. With the recent advances in observational measurements&#10;probing the hot CGM in X&#45;rays and tSZ, we have a new avenue for widening our&#10;knowledge of gas physics and feedback by exploiting the information from&#10;current/future observations. In this paper, we use the TNG300 hydrodynamical&#10;simulations to build a fully self&#45;consistent forward model for the hot CGM. We&#10;construct a lightcone and generate mock X&#45;ray observations. We quantify the&#10;projection effects, namely the locally correlated large&#45;scale structure in&#10;X&#45;rays and the effect due to satellite galaxies misclassified as centrals which&#10;affects the measured hot CGM galactocentric profiles in stacking experiments.&#10;We present an analytical model that describes the intrinsic X&#45;ray surface&#10;brightness profile across the stellar and halo mass bins. The increasing&#10;stellar mass bins result in decreasing values of $beta$, the exponent&#10;quantifying the slope of the intrinsic galactocentric profiles. We carry&#10;forward the current state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art by also showing the impact of the locally&#10;correlated environment on the measured X&#45;ray surface brightness profiles. We&#10;also present, for the first time, the effect of misclassified centrals in&#10;stacking experiments for three stellar mass bins: $10^{10.5&#45;11} M_odot$,&#10;$10^{11&#45;11.2} M_odot$, and $10^{11.2&#45;11.5} M_odot$. We find that the&#10;contaminating effect of the misclassified centrals on the stacked profiles&#10;increases when the stellar mass decreases.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10397v1) |&#10;| MOST: MR reconstruction Optimization for multiple downStream Tasks via&#10; &#160;continual learning | Hwihun Jeong, Se Young Chun, Jongho Lee | &#160;&#160;Deep learning&#45;based Magnetic Resonance (MR) reconstruction methods have&#10;focused on generating high&#45;quality images but they often overlook the impact on&#10;downstream tasks (e.g., segmentation) that utilize the reconstructed images.&#10;Cascading separately trained reconstruction network and downstream task network&#10;has been shown to introduce performance degradation due to error propagation&#10;and domain gaps between training datasets. To mitigate this issue, downstream&#10;task&#45;oriented reconstruction optimization has been proposed for a single&#10;downstream task. Expanding this optimization to multi&#45;task scenarios is not&#10;straightforward. In this work, we extended this optimization to sequentially&#10;introduced multiple downstream tasks and demonstrated that a single MR&#10;reconstruction network can be optimized for multiple downstream tasks by&#10;deploying continual learning (MOST). MOST integrated techniques from&#10;replay&#45;based continual learning and image&#45;guided loss to overcome catastrophic&#10;forgetting. Comparative experiments demonstrated that MOST outperformed a&#10;reconstruction network without finetuning, a reconstruction network with&#10;na&quot;ive finetuning, and conventional continual learning methods. This&#10;advancement empowers the application of a single MR reconstruction network for&#10;multiple downstream tasks.

In particular, we analyse the task of&#10;textit{multicopy state teleportation}, where Alice has $k$ identical copies of&#10;an arbitrary unknown $d$&#45;dimensional qudit state $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to teleport&#10;a single copy of $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to Bob using a maximally entangled&#10;two&#45;qudit state shared between Alice and Bob without Bob&#39;s correction. Alice&#10;may perform a joint measurement on her half of the entangled state and the $k$&#10;copies of $vertpsi&#13;angle$. We prove that the maximal probability of success&#10;for teleporting the exact state $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to Bob is&#10;$p(d,k)=frac{k}{d(k&#45;1+d)}$ and present an explicit protocol to attain this&#10;performance. Then, by utilising $k$ copies of an arbitrary target state&#10;$vertpsi&#13;angle$, we show how the multicopy state teleportation protocol can&#10;be employed to enhance the success probability of storage and retrieval of&#10;quantum programs, which aims to universally retrieve the action of an arbitrary&#10;quantum channel that is stored in a state. Our proofs make use of group&#10;representation theory methods, which may find applications beyond the problems&#10;addressed in this work.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10393v1) |&#10;| TPFL: Tsetlin&#45;Personalized Federated Learning with Confidence&#45;Based&#10; &#160;Clustering | Rasoul Jafari Gohari, Laya Aliahmadipour, Ezat Valipour | &#160;&#160;The world of Machine Learning (ML) has witnessed rapid changes in terms of&#10;new models and ways to process users data. The majority of work that has been&#10;done is focused on Deep Learning (DL) based approaches. However, with the&#10;emergence of new algorithms such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm, there&#10;is growing interest in exploring alternative approaches that may offer unique&#10;advantages in certain domains or applications. One of these domains is&#10;Federated Learning (FL), in which users privacy is of utmost importance. Due to&#10;its novelty, FL has seen a surge in the incorporation of personalization&#10;techniques to enhance model accuracy while maintaining user privacy under&#10;personalized conditions. In this work, we propose a novel approach dubbed TPFL:&#10;Tsetlin&#45;Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into&#10;clusters based on their confidence towards a specific class. In this way,&#10;clustering can benefit from two key advantages. Firstly, clients share only&#10;what they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight&#10;aggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been&#10;enough during the training. This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are&#10;non&#45;Independent and Identically Distributed (non&#45;IID). Secondly, by sharing&#10;only weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially&#10;reduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication&#10;cost. The results of TPFL demonstrated the highest accuracy on three different&#10;datasets; namely MNIST, FashionMNIST and FEMNIST.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10392v1) |&#10;| Prompt&#45;and&#45;Transfer: Dynamic Class&#45;aware Enhancement for Few&#45;shot&#10; &#160;Segmentation | Hanbo Bi, Yingchao Feng, Wenhui Diao, Peijin Wang, Yongqiang Mao, Kun Fu, Hongqi Wang, Xian Sun | &#160;&#160;For more efficient generalization to unseen domains (classes), most Few&#45;shot&#10;Segmentation (FSS) would directly exploit pre&#45;trained encoders and only&#10;fine&#45;tune the decoder, especially in the current era of large models. However,&#10;such fixed feature encoders tend to be class&#45;agnostic, inevitably activating&#10;objects that are irrelevant to the target class. In contrast, humans can&#10;effortlessly focus on specific objects in the line of sight. This paper mimics&#10;the visual perception pattern of human beings and proposes a novel and powerful&#10;prompt&#45;driven scheme, called ``Prompt and Transfer&quot; (PAT), which constructs a&#10;dynamic class&#45;aware prompting paradigm to tune the encoder for focusing on the&#10;interested object (target class) in the current task. Three key points are&#10;elaborated to enhance the prompting: 1) Cross&#45;modal linguistic information is&#10;introduced to initialize prompts for each task. 2) Semantic Prompt Transfer&#10;(SPT) that precisely transfers the class&#45;specific semantics within the images&#10;to prompts. 3) Part Mask Generator (PMG) that works in conjunction with SPT to&#10;adaptively generate different but complementary part prompts for different&#10;individuals. Surprisingly, PAT achieves competitive performance on 4 different&#10;tasks including standard FSS, Cross&#45;domain FSS (e.g., CV, medical, and remote&#10;sensing domains), Weak&#45;label FSS, and Zero&#45;shot Segmentation, setting new&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;arts on 11 benchmarks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10389v1) |&#10;| Revising the Structure of Recurrent Neural Networks to Eliminate&#10; &#160;Numerical Derivatives in Forming Physics Informed Loss Terms with Respect to&#10; &#160;Time | Mahyar Jahani&#45;nasab, Mohamad Ali Bijarchi | &#160;&#160;Solving unsteady partial differential equations (PDEs) using recurrent neural&#10;networks (RNNs) typically requires numerical derivatives between each block of&#10;the RNN to form the physics informed loss function. However, this introduces&#10;the complexities of numerical derivatives into the training process of these&#10;models. In this study, we propose modifying the structure of the traditional&#10;RNN to enable the prediction of each block over a time interval, making it&#10;possible to calculate the derivative of the output with respect to time using&#10;the backpropagation algorithm. To achieve this, the time intervals of these&#10;blocks are overlapped, defining a mutual loss function between them.&#10;Additionally, the employment of conditional hidden states enables us to achieve&#10;a unique solution for each block. The forget factor is utilized to control the&#10;influence of the conditional hidden state on the prediction of the subsequent&#10;block. This new model, termed the Mutual Interval RNN (MI&#45;RNN), is applied to&#10;solve three different benchmarks: the Burgers equation, unsteady heat&#10;conduction in an irregular domain, and the Green vortex problem. Our results&#10;demonstrate that MI&#45;RNN can find the exact solution more accurately compared to&#10;existing RNN models. For instance, in the second problem, MI&#45;RNN achieved one&#10;order of magnitude less relative error compared to the RNN model with numerical&#10;derivatives.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10388v1) |&#10;| Sharp decay rate for eigenfunctions of perturbed periodic Schrödinger&#10; &#160;operators | Wencai Liu, Rodrigo Matos, John N. Treuer | &#160;&#160;This paper investigates uniqueness results for perturbed periodic&#10;Schr&quot;odinger operators on $mathbb{Z}^d$. Specifically, we consider operators&#10;of the form $H = &#45;Delta + V + v$, where $Delta$ is the discrete Laplacian,&#10;$V: mathbb{Z}^d &#13;ightarrow mathbb{R}$ is a periodic potential, and $v:&#10;mathbb{Z}^d &#13;ightarrow mathbb{C}$ represents a decaying impurity. We&#10;establish quantitative conditions under which the equation $&#45;Delta u + V u + v&#10;u = &#10;ambda u$, for $&#10;ambda in mathbb{C}$, admits only the trivial solution&#10;$u equiv 0$. Key applications include the absence of embedded eigenvalues for&#10;operators with impurities decaying faster than any exponential function and the&#10;determination of sharp decay rates for eigenfunctions. Our findings extend&#10;previous works by providing precise decay conditions for impurities and&#10;analyzing different spectral regimes of $&#10;ambda$.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10387v1) |&#10;| Mamba&#45;ST: State Space Model for Efficient Style Transfer | Filippo Botti, Alex Ergasti, Leonardo Rossi, Tomaso Fontanini, Claudio Ferrari, Massimo Bertozzi, Andrea Prati | &#160;&#160;The goal of style transfer is, given a content image and a style source,&#10;generating a new image preserving the content but with the artistic&#10;representation of the style source. Most of the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art architectures&#10;use transformers or diffusion&#45;based models to perform this task, despite the&#10;heavy computational burden that they require. In particular, transformers use&#10;self&#45; and cross&#45;attention layers which have large memory footprint, while&#10;diffusion models require high inference time. To overcome the above, this paper&#10;explores a novel design of Mamba, an emergent State&#45;Space Model (SSM), called&#10;Mamba&#45;ST, to perform style transfer. To do so, we adapt Mamba linear equation&#10;to simulate the behavior of cross&#45;attention layers, which are able to combine&#10;two separate embeddings into a single output, but drastically reducing memory&#10;usage and time complexity. We modified the Mamba&#39;s inner equations so to accept&#10;inputs from, and combine, two separate data streams. To the best of our&#10;knowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt the equations of SSMs to a vision&#10;task like style transfer without requiring any other module like&#10;cross&#45;attention or custom normalization layers. An extensive set of experiments&#10;demonstrates the superiority and efficiency of our method in performing style&#10;transfer compared to transformers and diffusion models.

This module employs the Z4c formulation to solve the Einstein&#10;equations. We demonstrate its accuracy through a series of standard numerical&#10;relativity tests, including convergence of the gravitational waveform from&#10;binary black hole coalescence. Furthermore, we conduct scaling tests on OLCF&#10;Frontier and NERSC Perlmutter, where AthenaK exhibits excellent weak scaling&#10;efficiency of 80% on up to 65,536 AMD MI250X GPUs on Frontier (relative to 4&#10;GPUs) and strong scaling efficiencies of 84% and 77% on AMD MI250X and NVIDIA&#10;A100 GPUs on Frontier and Perlmutter respectively. Additionally, we observe a&#10;significant performance boost, with two orders of magnitude speedup ($gtrsim&#10;200times$) on a GPU compared to a single CPU core, affirming that AthenaK is&#10;well&#45;suited for exascale computing, thereby expanding the potential for&#10;breakthroughs in numerical relativity research.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10383v1) |&#10;| J&#45;UBIK: The JAX&#45;accelerated Universal Bayesian Imaging Kit | Vincent Eberle, Matteo Guardiani, Margret Westerkamp, Philipp Frank, Julian Rüstig, Julia Stadler, Torsten A. Enßlin | &#160;&#160;Many advances in astronomy and astrophysics originate from accurate images of&#10;the sky emission across multiple wavelengths. This often requires&#10;reconstructing spatially and spectrally correlated signals detected from&#10;multiple instruments. To facilitate the high&#45;fidelity imaging of these signals,&#10;we introduce the universal Bayesian imaging kit (UBIK). Specifically, we&#10;present J&#45;UBIK, a flexible and modular implementation leveraging the&#10;JAX&#45;accelerated NIFTy.re software as its backend. J&#45;UBIK streamlines the&#10;implementation of the key Bayesian inference components, providing for all the&#10;necessary steps of Bayesian imaging pipelines. First, it provides adaptable&#10;prior models for different sky realizations. Second, it includes likelihood&#10;models tailored to specific instruments. So far, the package includes three&#10;instruments: Chandra and eROSITA for X&#45;ray observations, and the James Webb&#10;Space Telescope (JWST) for the near&#45; and mid&#45;infrared. The aim is to expand&#10;this set in the future. Third, these models can be integrated with various&#10;inference and optimization schemes, such as maximum a posteriori estimation and&#10;variational inference. Explicit demos show how to integrate the individual&#10;modules into a full analysis pipeline. Overall, J&#45;UBIK enables efficient&#10;generation of high&#45;fidelity images via Bayesian pipelines that can be tailored&#10;to specific research objectives.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10381v1) |&#10;| Thermolectricity in irradiated bilayer graphene flakes | Cynthia Ihuoma Osuala, Tanu Choudhary, Raju K. Biswas, Sudin Ganguly, Chunlei Qu, Santanu K. Maiti | &#160;&#160;We present a comprehensive study on enhancing the thermoelectric (TE)&#10;performance of bilayer graphene (BLG) through irradiation with arbitrarily&#10;polarized light, focusing on $AA$&#45; and $AB$&#45;stacked configurations with zigzag&#10;edges. Utilizing a combination of tight&#45;binding theory and density functional&#10;theory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on&#10;electronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the&#10;electronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function,&#10;which significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the&#10;overall {it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT&#10;calculations reveal that $AB$&#45;stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal&#10;conductivity compared to $AA$&#45;stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic&#10;scattering and phonon group velocity. The combined analysis shows that FOM&#10;exceeds unity in both stacking types, with notable improvements near the&#10;irradiation&#45;induced gap. Additionally, we explore the dependence of FOM on the&#10;system dimensions and temperature, demonstrating that light&#45;irradiated BLG&#10;holds great promise for efficient thermoelectric energy conversion and waste&#10;heat recovery. Our results show favorable responses over a wide range of&#10;irradiation parameters. These findings provide crucial insights into optimizing&#10;BLG for advanced TE applications through light&#45;induced modifications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10380v1) |&#10;| Leveraging Joint Spectral and Spatial Learning with MAMBA for&#10; &#160;Multichannel Speech Enhancement | Wenze Ren, Haibin Wu, Yi&#45;Cheng Lin, Xuanjun Chen, Rong Chao, Kuo&#45;Hsuan Hung, You&#45;Jin Li, Wen&#45;Yuan Ting, Hsin&#45;Min Wang, Yu Tsao | &#160;&#160;In multichannel speech enhancement, effectively capturing spatial and&#10;spectral information across different microphones is crucial for noise&#10;reduction. Traditional methods, such as CNN or LSTM, attempt to model the&#10;temporal dynamics of full&#45;band and sub&#45;band spectral and spatial features.&#10;However, these approaches face limitations in fully modeling complex temporal&#10;dependencies, especially in dynamic acoustic environments. To overcome these&#10;challenges, we modify the current advanced model McNet by introducing an&#10;improved version of Mamba, a state&#45;space model, and further propose MCMamba.&#10;MCMamba has been completely reengineered to integrate full&#45;band and narrow&#45;band&#10;spatial information with sub&#45;band and full&#45;band spectral features, providing a&#10;more comprehensive approach to modeling spatial and spectral information.

This study introduces&#10;a novel statistical approach, TAR4C, to dissect causal interactions in&#10;multichannel EEG recordings. TAR4C uses the threshold autoregressive model to&#10;describe the causal interaction between nodes or clusters of nodes in a brain&#10;network. The perspective involves testing whether one node, which may represent&#10;a brain region, can control the dynamics of the other. The node that has such&#10;an impact on the other is called a threshold variable and can be classified as&#10;a causative because its functionality is the leading source operating as an&#10;instantaneous switching mechanism that regulates the time&#45;varying&#10;autoregressive structure of the other. This statistical concept is commonly&#10;referred to as threshold non&#45;linearity. Once threshold non&#45;linearity has been&#10;verified between a pair of nodes, the subsequent essential facet of TAR&#10;modeling is to assess the predictive ability of the causal node for the current&#10;activity on the other and represent causal interactions in autoregressive&#10;terms. This predictive ability is what underlies Granger causality. The TAR4C&#10;approach can discover non&#45;linear and time&#45;dependent causal interactions without&#10;negating the G&#45;causality perspective. The efficacy of the proposed approach is&#10;exemplified by analyzing the EEG signals recorded during the motor&#10;movement/imagery experiment. The similarities and differences between the&#10;causal interactions manifesting during the execution and the imagery of a given&#10;motor movement are demonstrated by analyzing EEG recordings from multiple&#10;subjects.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10374v1) |&#10;| Instigating Cooperation among LLM Agents Using Adaptive Information&#10; &#160;Modulation | Qiliang Chen, &#160;Alireza, &#160;Ilami, Nunzio Lore, Babak Heydari | &#160;&#160;This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for&#10;human strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these&#10;agents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments. Our&#10;approach extends traditional agent&#45;based simulations by using strategic LLM&#10;agents (SLA) and introducing dynamic and adaptive governance through a&#10;pro&#45;social promoting RL agent (PPA) that modulates information access across&#10;agents in a network, optimizing social welfare and promoting pro&#45;social&#10;behavior. Through validation in iterative games, including the prisoner&#10;dilemma, we demonstrate that SLA agents exhibit nuanced strategic adaptations.&#10;The PPA agent effectively learns to adjust information transparency, resulting&#10;in enhanced cooperation rates. This framework offers significant insights into&#10;AI&#45;mediated social dynamics, contributing to the deployment of AI in real&#45;world&#10;team settings.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10372v1) |&#10;| Learning Gentle Grasping from Human&#45;Free Force Control Demonstration | Mingxuan Li, Lunwei Zhang, Tiemin Li, Yao Jiang | &#160;&#160;Humans can steadily and gently grasp unfamiliar objects based on tactile&#10;perception.

Their widespread&#10;industrial use and resistance to degradation have led to global environmental&#10;contamination and significant health concerns. While a minority of PFAS have&#10;been extensively studied, the toxicity of many PFAS remains poorly understood&#10;due to limited direct toxicological data. This study advances the predictive&#10;modeling of PFAS toxicity by combining semi&#45;supervised graph convolutional&#10;networks (GCNs) with molecular descriptors and fingerprints. We propose a novel&#10;approach to enhance the prediction of PFAS binding affinities by isolating&#10;molecular fingerprints to construct graphs where then descriptors are set as&#10;the node features. This approach specifically captures the structural,&#10;physicochemical, and topological features of PFAS without overfitting due to an&#10;abundance of features. Unsupervised clustering then identifies representative&#10;compounds for detailed binding studies. Our results provide a more accurate&#10;ability to estimate PFAS hepatotoxicity to provide guidance in chemical&#10;discovery of new PFAS and the development of new safety regulations.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10370v1) |&#10;| Stochastic Control of UAVs: An Optimal Tradeoff between Performance,&#10; &#160;Flight Smoothness and Control Effort | George Rapakoulias, Panagiotis Tsiotras | &#160;&#160;Safe and accurate control of unmanned aerial vehicles in the presence of&#10;winds is a challenging control problem due to the hard&#45;to&#45;model and highly&#10;stochastic nature of the disturbance forces acting upon the vehicle. To meet&#10;performance constraints, state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art control methods such as Incremental&#10;Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) or other adaptive control techniques require&#10;high control gains to mitigate the effects of uncertainty entering the system.&#10;While achieving good tracking performance, IDNI requires excessive control&#10;effort, results in high actuator strain, and reduced flight smoothness due to&#10;constant and aggressive corrective actions commanded by the controller. In this&#10;paper, we propose a novel control architecture that allows the user to&#10;systematically address the trade&#45;off between high authority control and&#10;performance constraint satisfaction.

Unlike physics&#45;based models, machine learning&#10;(ML)&#45;based models offer promising solutions for efficiently integrating large&#10;volumes of diverse data. We present EF4INCA, a spatiotemporal Transformer model&#10;for precipitation nowcasting that integrates satellite&#45; and ground&#45;based&#10;observations with numerical weather prediction outputs. EF4INCA provides&#10;high&#45;resolution forecasts over Austria, accurately predicting the location and&#10;shape of precipitation fields with a spatial resolution of 1 kilometre and a&#10;temporal resolution of 5 minutes, up to 90 minutes ahead. Our evaluation shows&#10;that EF4INCA outperforms conventional nowcasting models, including the&#10;operational model of Austria, particularly in scenarios with complex temporal&#10;features such as convective initiation and rapid weather changes. EF4INCA&#10;maintains higher accuracy in location forecasting but generates smoother fields&#10;at later prediction times compared to traditional models. Interpretation of our&#10;model showed that precipitation products and SEVIRI infrared channels CH7 and&#10;CH9 are the most important data streams. These results underscore the&#10;importance of combining data from different domains, including physics&#45;based&#10;model products, with ML approaches. Our study highlights the robustness of&#10;EF4INCA and its potential for improved precipitation nowcasting. We provide&#10;access to our code repository, model weights, and the dataset curated for&#10;benchmarking, facilitating further development and application.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10367v1) |&#10;&#10;">

Hill, Matthias Kluge, Martin Landriau, Ximena Mazzalay, Eva Noyola, Taniya Parikh, Jan Snigula | &#160;&#160;We analyse the stellar structure of a sample of dwarf ellipticals (dE)&#10;inhabiting various environments within the Virgo cluster. Integral&#45;field&#10;observations with a high spectral resolution allow us to robustly determine&#10;their low velocity dispersions ($sim25$ km s$^{&#45;1}$) and higher&#45;order&#10;kinematic moments out to the half&#45;light radius. We find the dEs exhibit a&#10;diversity in ages with the younger dEs being less enhanced than the older,&#10;suggesting a complex star formation history for those dEs that recently entered&#10;Virgo while others have been quenched shortly after reionization.&#10;Orbit&#45;superposition modeling allowed us to recover viewing angles, stellar&#10;mass&#45;to&#45;light ratios (with gradients), as well as the intrinsic orbit&#10;structure. We find that the angular momentum of the dEs is strongly suppressed&#10;compared to ordinary early&#45;type galaxies and correlates with the environment.&#10;Flattened dEs are so because of a suppressed kinetic energy perpendicular to&#10;their equatorial plane. Combining population and dynamical modeling results, we&#10;find an age&#45;dependent stellar initial mass function (IMF) or, alternatively,&#10;evidence for a more extended star formation history for those galaxies that&#10;have had higher initial mass and/or inhabited lower density environments. dEs&#10;appear to have a spatially homogeneous stellar structure but the state they&#10;were `frozen&#39; in as they stopped forming stars varies dramatically according to&#10;their initial conditions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10518v1) |&#10;| RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long&#45;Context LLM Inference via Vector&#10; &#160;Retrieval | Di Liu, Meng Chen, Baotong Lu, Huiqiang Jiang, Zhenhua Han, Qianxi Zhang, Qi Chen, Chengruidong Zhang, Bailu Ding, Kai Zhang, Chen Chen, Fan Yang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu | &#160;&#160;Transformer&#45;based large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly important&#10;in various domains. However, the quadratic time complexity of attention&#10;operation poses a significant challenge for scaling to longer contexts due to&#10;the extremely high inference latency and GPU memory consumption for caching&#10;key&#45;value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training&#45;free&#10;approach to accelerate attention computation. To leverage the dynamic sparse&#10;property of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor&#10;search (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most&#10;relevant ones via vector search during generation. Due to the&#10;out&#45;of&#45;distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors, off&#45;the&#45;shelf&#10;ANNS indexes still need to scan O(N) (usually 30% of all keys) data for&#10;accurate retrieval, which fails to exploit the high sparsity.&#10;RetrievalAttention first identifies the OOD challenge of ANNS&#45;based attention,&#10;and addresses it via an attention&#45;aware vector search algorithm that can adapt&#10;to queries and only access 1&#45;&#45;3% of data, thus achieving a sub&#45;linear time&#10;complexity. RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of&#10;long&#45;context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the&#10;model accuracy. Especially, RetrievalAttention only needs 16GB GPU memory for&#10;serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating&#10;one token in 0.188 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB).&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516v1) |&#10;| An Efficient Self&#45;Learning Framework For Interactive Spoken Dialog&#10; &#160;Systems | Hitesh Tulsiani, David M. Chan, Shalini Ghosh, Garima Lalwani, Prabhat Pandey, Ankish Bansal, Sri Garimella, Ariya Rastrow, Björn Hoffmeister | &#160;&#160;Dialog systems, such as voice assistants, are expected to engage with users&#10;in complex, evolving conversations. Unfortunately, traditional automatic speech&#10;recognition (ASR) systems deployed in such applications are usually trained to&#10;recognize each turn independently and lack the ability to adapt to the&#10;conversational context or incorporate user feedback. In this work, we introduce&#10;a general framework for ASR in dialog systems that can go beyond learning from&#10;single&#45;turn utterances and learn over time how to adapt to both explicit&#10;supervision and implicit user feedback present in multi&#45;turn conversations. We&#10;accomplish that by leveraging advances in student&#45;teacher learning and&#10;context&#45;aware dialog processing, and designing contrastive self&#45;supervision&#10;approaches with Ohm, a new online hard&#45;negative mining approach. We show that&#10;leveraging our new framework compared to traditional training leads to relative&#10;WER reductions of close to 10% in real&#45;world dialog systems, and up to 26% on&#10;public synthetic data.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10515v1) |&#10;| Constraints on axions from patchy screening of the cosmic microwave&#10; &#160;background | Samuel Goldstein, Fiona McCarthy, Cristina Mondino, J. Colin Hill, Junwu Huang, Matthew C. Johnson | &#160;&#160;The resonant conversion of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons into&#10;axions within large&#45;scale structure induces an anisotropic spectral distortion&#10;in CMB temperature maps. Applying state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art foreground cleaning&#10;techniques to $textit{Planck}$ CMB observations, we construct maps of&#10;axion&#45;induced &quot;patchy screening&quot; of the CMB. We cross&#45;correlate these maps with&#10;data from the $textit{unWISE}$ galaxy survey and find no evidence of axions.&#10;We constrain the axion&#45;photon coupling, $g_{agammagamma} &#10;esssim 2 times&#10;10^{&#45;12}~{&#13;m GeV}^{&#45;1}$, at the 95% confidence level for axion masses in the&#10;range $10^{&#45;13}~{&#13;m eV} &#10;esssim m_a &#10;esssim 10^{&#45;12}~{&#13;m eV}$. These&#10;constraints are competitive with the tightest astrophysical axion limits in&#10;this mass range and are inferred from robust population&#45;level statistics, which&#10;makes them complementary to existing searches that rely on modeling of&#10;individual systems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10514v1) |&#10;| Weak Superimposed Codes of Improved Asymptotic Rate and Their Randomized&#10; &#160;Construction | Yu Tsunoda, Yuichiro Fujiwara | &#160;&#160;Weak superimposed codes are combinatorial structures related closely to&#10;generalized cover&#45;free families, superimposed codes, and disjunct matrices in&#10;that they are only required to satisfy similar but less stringent conditions.&#10;This class of codes may also be seen as a stricter variant of what are known as&#10;locally thin families in combinatorics. Originally, weak superimposed codes&#10;were introduced in the context of multimedia content protection against illegal&#10;distribution of copies under the assumption that a coalition of malicious users&#10;may employ the averaging attack with adversarial noise. As in many other kinds&#10;of codes in information theory, it is of interest and importance in the study&#10;of weak superimposed codes to find the highest achievable rate in the&#10;asymptotic regime and give an efficient construction that produces an infinite&#10;sequence of codes that achieve it. Here, we prove a tighter lower bound than&#10;the sharpest known one on the rate of optimal weak superimposed codes and give&#10;a polynomial&#45;time randomized construction algorithm for codes that&#10;asymptotically attain our improved bound with high probability. Our&#10;probabilistic approach is versatile and applicable to many other related codes&#10;and arrays.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10511v1) |&#10;| Pennsieve &#45; A Collaborative Platform for Translational Neuroscience and&#10; &#160;Beyond | Zack Goldblum, Zhongchuan Xu, Haoer Shi, Patryk Orzechowski, Jamaal Spence, Kathryn A Davis, Brian Litt, Nishant Sinha, Joost Wagenaar | &#160;&#160;The exponential growth of neuroscientific data necessitates platforms that&#10;facilitate data management and multidisciplinary collaboration.

It takes a&#10;comprehensive approach to data integration, enabling researchers to define&#10;custom metadata schemas and utilize advanced tools to filter and query their&#10;data. Pennsieve&#39;s modular architecture allows external applications to extend&#10;its capabilities, and collaborative workspaces with peer&#45;reviewed data&#10;publishing mechanisms promote high&#45;quality datasets optimized for downstream&#10;analysis, both in the cloud and on&#45;premises.&#10; &#160;Pennsieve forms the core for major neuroscience research programs including&#10;the NIH SPARC Initiative, NIH HEAL Initiative&#39;s PRECISION Human Pain Network,&#10;and NIH HEAL RE&#45;JOIN Initiative. It serves more than 80 research groups&#10;worldwide, along with several large&#45;scale, inter&#45;institutional projects at&#10;clinical sites through the University of Pennsylvania. Underpinning the&#10;SPARC.Science, Epilepsy.Science, and Pennsieve Discover portals, Pennsieve&#10;stores over 125 TB of scientific data, with 35 TB of data publicly available&#10;across more than 350 high&#45;impact datasets.

Specifically, we investigate the role of resistivity&#10;in the dynamical evolution of neutron stars over a period of up to 100 ms and&#10;its effects on their quasi&#45;equilibrium configurations. Our results demonstrate&#10;that resistivity can significantly influence the development of&#10;magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, resulting in markedly different magnetic&#10;field geometries. Additionally, resistivity suppresses the growth of these&#10;instabilities, leading to a reduction in the amplitude of emitted gravitational&#10;waves. Despite the variations in magnetic field geometries, the ratio of&#10;poloidal to toroidal field energies remains consistently 9:1 throughout the&#10;simulations, for the models we investigated.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10508v1) |&#10;| Beth&#45;Uhlenbeck equation for the thermodynamics of fluctuations in a&#10; &#160;generalised 2+1D Gross&#45;Neveu model | Biplab Mahato, David Blaschke, Dietmar Ebert | &#160;&#160;We study a generalised version of Gross&#45;Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions. The&#10;model is inspired from graphene which shows a linear dispersion relation near&#10;the Dirac points. The phase structure and the thermodynamic properties in the&#10;mean field approximation have been studied before.

We discuss the excitonic mass, fluctuation pressure and&#10;phase shifts. We also perform a comparison with the NJL model in 3+1 dimension&#10;and discuss its implication for graphene.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10507v1) |&#10;| Context&#45;aware Code Segmentation for C&#45;to&#45;Rust Translation using Large&#10; &#160;Language Models | Momoko Shiraishi, Takahiro Shinagawa | &#160;&#160;There is strong motivation to translate C code into Rust code due to the&#10;continuing threat of memory safety vulnerabilities in existing C programs and&#10;the significant attention paid to Rust as an alternative to the C language.&#10;While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating this translation&#10;by generating more natural and safer code than rule&#45;based methods, previous&#10;studies have shown that LLM&#45;generated Rust code often fails to compile, even&#10;for relatively small C programs, due to significant differences between the two&#10;languages and context window limitations. We propose an LLM&#45;based translation&#10;scheme that improves the success rate of translating large&#45;scale C code into&#10;compilable Rust code. Our approach involves three key techniques: (1)&#10;pre&#45;processing the C code to better align its structure and expressions with&#10;Rust, (2) segmenting the code into optimally sized translation units to avoid&#10;exceeding the LLM&#39;s context window limits, and (3) iteratively compiling and&#10;repairing errors while maintaining consistency between translation units using&#10;context&#45;supplementing prompts. Compilation success is an essential first step&#10;in achieving functional equivalence, as only compilable code can be further&#10;tested. In experiments with 20 benchmark C programs, including those exceeding&#10;4 kilo lines of code, we successfully translated all programs into compilable&#10;Rust code without losing corresponding parts of the original code.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10506v1) |&#10;| Machine Learning Optimization of non&#45;Kasha Behavior and of Transient&#10; &#160;Dynamics in Model Retinal Isomerization | Davinder Singh, Chern Chuang, Paul Brumer | &#160;&#160;Designing a model of retinal isomerization in Rhodopsin, the first step in&#10;vision, that accounts for both experimental transient and stationary state&#10;observables is challenging. Here, multi&#45;objective Bayesian optimization is&#10;employed to refine the parameters of a minimal two&#45;state&#45;two&#45;mode (TM) model&#10;describing the photoisomerization of retinal in Rhodopsin. With an appropriate&#10;selection of objectives, the optimized retinal model predicts excitation&#10;wavelength&#45;dependent fluorescence spectra that closely align with&#10;experimentally observed non&#45;Kasha behavior in the non&#45;equilibrium steady state.&#10;Further, adjustments to the potential energy surface within the TM model reduce&#10;the discrepancies across the time domain.

Existing works often rely&#10;on local interpretability methods, failing to provide comprehensive&#10;explanations of the overall mechanism behind each label prediction within a&#10;multilabel set. We propose a mechanistic interpretability module called&#10;DIctionary Label Attention (method) that disentangles uninterpretable dense&#10;embeddings into a sparse embedding space, where each nonzero element (a&#10;dictionary feature) represents a globally learned medical concept. Through&#10;human evaluations, we show that our sparse embeddings are more human&#10;understandable than its dense counterparts by at least 50 percent. Our&#10;automated dictionary feature identification pipeline, leveraging large language&#10;models (LLMs), uncovers thousands of learned medical concepts by examining and&#10;summarizing the highest activating tokens for each dictionary feature. We&#10;represent the relationships between dictionary features and medical codes&#10;through a sparse interpretable matrix, enhancing the mechanistic and global&#10;understanding of the model&#39;s predictions while maintaining competitive&#10;performance and scalability without extensive human annotation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10504v1) |&#10;| Causal Language Modeling Can Elicit Search and Reasoning Capabilities on&#10; &#160;Logic Puzzles | Kulin Shah, Nishanth Dikkala, Xin Wang, Rina Panigrahy | &#160;&#160;Causal language modeling using the Transformer architecture has yielded&#10;remarkable capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) over the last few&#10;years. However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning&#10;capabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this&#10;work, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as&#10;solving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to&#10;search over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then&#10;apply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the&#10;application of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in&#10;a cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases,&#10;multiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We&#10;observe that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn&#10;to solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21%$ of the puzzles fully correctly)&#10;when trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that&#10;training Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and&#10;without such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis&#10;to Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves&#10;$92.04 %$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal&#10;representations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear&#10;probing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any&#10;given cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine&#10;implicit in the Transformer weights.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10502v1) |&#10;| Alignment with nonlinear velocity couplings: collision&#45;avoidance and&#10; &#160;micro&#45;to&#45;macro mean&#45;field limits | Young&#45;Pil Choi, Michał Fabisiak, Jan Peszek | &#160;&#160;We investigate the pressureless fractional Euler&#45;alignment system with&#10;nonlinear velocity couplings, referred to as the $p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system.&#10;This model features a nonlinear velocity alignment force, interpreted as a&#10;density&#45;weighted fractional $p$&#45;Laplacian when the singularity parameter&#10;$alpha$ exceeds the spatial dimension $d$. Our primary goal is to establish&#10;the existence of solutions for strongly singular interactions ($alpha ge d$)&#10;and compactly supported initial conditions. We construct solutions as&#10;mean&#45;field limits of empirical measures from a kinetic variant of the&#10;$p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system. Specifically, we show that a sequence of empirical&#10;measures converges to a finite Radon measure, whose local density and velocity&#10;satisfy the $p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system. Our results are the first to prove the&#10;existence of solutions to this system in multi&#45;dimensional settings without&#10;significant initial data restrictions, covering both nonlinear ($p&gt;2$) and&#10;linear ($p=2$) cases. Additionally, we establish global existence, uniqueness,&#10;and collision avoidance for the corresponding particle ODE system under&#10;non&#45;collisional initial conditions, extending previous results for $1 &#10;e p &#10;e&#10;alpha + 2$. This analysis supports our mean&#45;field limit argument and&#10;contributes to understanding alignment models with singular communication.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10501v1) |&#10;| Focus diverse phase retrieval test results on broadband continuous&#10; &#160;wavefront sensing in space telescope applications | Hyukmo Kang, Kyle Van Gorkom, Meghdoot Biswas, Daewook Kim, Ewan S. Douglas | &#160;&#160;Continuous wavefront sensing benefits space observatories in on&#45;orbit optical&#10;performance maintenance. To measure the phase of a wavefront, phase retrieval&#10;is an attractive technique as it uses multiple point spread function (PSF)&#10;images that are acquired by the telescope itself without extra metrology&#10;systems nor complicated calibration. The focus diverse phase retrieval utilizes&#10;PSFs from predetermined defocused positions to enhance the dynamic range of the&#10;algorithm. We describe an updated visible light active optics testbed with the&#10;addition of a linear motorized focus stage. The performance of the phase&#10;retrieval algorithm in broadband is tested under various cases. While broadband&#10;pass filters have advantages in higher signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio (SNR), the&#10;performance of phase retrieval can be restricted due to blurred image caused by&#10;diffraction and increased computing cost. We used multiple bandpass filters (10&#10;nm, 88 nm, and 150 nm) and investigated effects of bandwidth on the accuracy&#10;and required image acquisition conditions such as SNR, reaching accuracies&#10;below 20 nm RMS wavefront error at the widest bandwidth. We also investigated&#10;the dynamic range of the phase retrieval algorithm depending on the bandwidth&#10;and required amount of defocus to expand dynamic range. Finally, we simulated&#10;the continuous wavefront sensing and correction loop with a range of&#10;statistically generated representative telescope disturbance time series to&#10;test for edge cases.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10500v1) |&#10;| The role of higher&#45;order terms in trapped&#45;ion quantum computing with&#10; &#160;magnetic gradient induced coupling | Sebastian Nagies, Kevin T. Geier, Javed Akram, Junichi Okamoto, Dimitris Badounas, Christof Wunderlich, Michael Johanning, Philipp Hauke | &#160;&#160;Trapped&#45;ion hardware based on the Magnetic Gradient Induced Coupling (MAGIC)&#10;scheme is emerging as a promising platform for quantum computing. Nevertheless,&#10;in this (as in any other) quantum&#45;computing platform, many technical questions&#10;still have to be resolved before large&#45;scale and error&#45;tolerant applications&#10;are possible. In this work, we present a thorough discussion of the&#10;contribution of higher&#45;order terms to the MAGIC setup, which can occur due to&#10;anharmonicities in the external potential of the ion crystal (e.g., through&#10;Coulomb repulsion) or through curvature of the applied magnetic field. These&#10;terms take the form of three&#45;spin couplings as well as diverse terms that&#10;couple spins to phonons. We find that most of these are negligible in realistic&#10;situations, with only two contributions that need careful attention. First,&#10;there are parasitic longitudinal fields whose strength increases with chain&#10;length, but which can easily be compensated by a microwave detuning. Second,&#10;anharmonicities of the Coulomb interaction can lead to well&#45;known two&#45;to&#45;one&#10;conversions of phonon excitations, which can be avoided if the phonons are&#10;ground&#45;state cooled. Our detailed analysis constitutes an important&#10;contribution on the way of making magnetic&#45;gradient trapped&#45;ion quantum&#10;technology fit for large&#45;scale applications, and it may inspire new ways to&#10;purposefully design interaction terms.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10498v1) |&#10;| MusicLIME: Explainable Multimodal Music Understanding | Theodoros Sotirou, Vassilis Lyberatos, Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Stamou | &#160;&#160;Multimodal models are critical for music understanding tasks, as they capture&#10;the complex interplay between audio and lyrics.

Additionally, we enhance local explanations by&#10;aggregating them into global explanations, giving users a broader perspective&#10;of model behavior. Through this work, we contribute to improving the&#10;interpretability of multimodal music models, empowering users to make informed&#10;choices, and fostering more equitable, fair, and transparent music&#10;understanding systems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10496v1) |&#10;| Incorporating Classifier&#45;Free Guidance in Diffusion Model&#45;Based&#10; &#160;Recommendation | Noah Buchanan, Susan Gauch, Quan Mai | &#160;&#160;This paper presents a diffusion&#45;based recommender system that incorporates&#10;classifier&#45;free guidance. Most current recommender systems provide&#10;recommendations using conventional methods such as collaborative or&#10;content&#45;based filtering. Diffusion is a new approach to generative AI that&#10;improves on previous generative AI approaches such as Variational Autoencoders&#10;(VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We incorporate diffusion in&#10;a recommender system that mirrors the sequence users take when browsing and&#10;rating items. Although a few current recommender systems incorporate diffusion,&#10;they do not incorporate classifier&#45;free guidance, a new innovation in diffusion&#10;models as a whole. In this paper, we present a diffusion recommender system&#10;that augments the underlying recommender system model for improved performance&#10;and also incorporates classifier&#45;free guidance. Our findings show improvements&#10;over state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art recommender systems for most metrics for several&#10;recommendation tasks on a variety of datasets. In particular, our approach&#10;demonstrates the potential to provide better recommendations when data is&#10;sparse.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10494v1) |&#10;| Renormalization of the Einstein&#45;Cartan Theory in First&#45;Order Form | F. T. Brandt, J. Frenkel, S. Martins&#45;Filho, D. G. C. McKeon | &#160;&#160;We examine the Einstein&#45;Cartan (EC) theory in first&#45;order form, which has a&#10;diffeomorphism as well as a local Lorentz invariance. We study the&#10;renormalizability of this theory in the framework of the Batalin&#45;Vilkovisky&#10;formalism, which allows for a gauge invariant renormalization. Using the&#10;background field method, we discuss the gauge invariance of the background&#10;effective action and analyze the Ward identities which reflect the symmetries&#10;of the EC theory. As an application, we compute, in a general background gauge,&#10;the self&#45;energy of the tetrad field at one&#45;loop order.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10493v1) |&#10;| What we can learn from the angular differential rates (only) in&#10; &#160;semileptonic $B to D^* ell ν_ell$ decays | G. Martinelli, S. Simula, L. Vittorio | &#160;&#160;We present a new, simple approach to the study of semileptonic $B to D^*&#10;ell &#10;u_ell$ decays based on the angular distributions of the final state&#10;particles only. Our approach is model independent and never requires the&#10;knowledge of $vert V_{cb}vert$. By studying such distributions in the case of&#10;light leptons, a comparison between results from different data sets from the&#10;Belle and BelleII Collaborations and between data and Standard Model&#10;calculations is also given for several interesting quantities. A good&#10;consistency is observed between some of the experimental results and the&#10;theoretical predictions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10492v1) |&#10;| Code Vulnerability Detection: A Comparative Analysis of Emerging Large&#10; &#160;Language Models | Shaznin Sultana, Sadia Afreen, Nasir U. Eisty | &#160;&#160;The growing trend of vulnerability issues in software development as a result&#10;of a large dependence on open&#45;source projects has received considerable&#10;attention recently. This paper investigates the effectiveness of Large Language&#10;Models (LLMs) in identifying vulnerabilities within codebases, with a focus on&#10;the latest advancements in LLM technology. Through a comparative analysis, we&#10;assess the performance of emerging LLMs, specifically Llama, CodeLlama, Gemma,&#10;and CodeGemma, alongside established state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art models such as BERT,&#10;RoBERTa, and GPT&#45;3. Our study aims to shed light on the capabilities of LLMs in&#10;vulnerability detection, contributing to the enhancement of software security&#10;practices across diverse open&#45;source repositories. We observe that CodeGemma&#10;achieves the highest F1&#45;score of 58 and a Recall of 87, amongst the recent&#10;additions of large language models to detect software security vulnerabilities.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10490v1) |&#10;| Flash STU: Fast Spectral Transform Units | Y. Isabel Liu, Windsor Nguyen, Yagiz Devre, Evan Dogariu, Anirudha Majumdar, Elad Hazan | &#160;&#160;This paper describes an efficient, open source PyTorch implementation of the&#10;Spectral Transform Unit. We investigate sequence prediction tasks over several&#10;modalities including language, robotics, and simulated dynamical systems.

Our paper aims to investigate if VLMs&#10;pre&#45;trained on web&#45;scale data learn to encode object states, which can be&#10;extracted with zero&#45;shot text prompts. We curate an object state recognition&#10;dataset ChangeIt&#45;Frames, and evaluate nine open&#45;source VLMs, including models&#10;trained with contrastive and generative objectives. We observe that while these&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art vision&#45;language models can reliably perform object&#10;recognition, they consistently fail to accurately distinguish the objects&#39;&#10;physical states. Through extensive experiments, we identify three areas for&#10;improvements for VLMs to better encode object states, namely the quality of&#10;object localization, the architecture to bind concepts to objects, and the&#10;objective to learn discriminative visual and language encoders on object&#10;states. Data and code are released.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10488v1) |&#10;| A Host Galaxy Morphology Link Between Quasi&#45;Periodic Eruptions and Tidal&#10; &#160;Disruption Events | Olivier Gilbert, John J. Ruan, Michael Eracleous, Daryl Haggard, Jessie C. Runnoe | &#160;&#160;The physical processes that produce X&#45;ray Quasi&#45;Periodic Eruptions (QPEs)&#10;recently discovered from the nuclei of several low&#45;redshift galaxies are&#10;mysterious. Several pieces of observational evidence strongly suggest a link&#10;between QPEs and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE). Previous studies also reveal&#10;that the morphologies of TDE host galaxies are highly concentrated, with high&#10;Sersic indicies, bulge&#45;to&#45;total light (B/T) ratios, and stellar surface mass&#10;densities relative to the broader galaxy population. We use these distinctive&#10;properties to test the link between QPEs and TDEs, by comparing these&#10;parameters of QPE host galaxies to TDE host galaxies. We employ archival Legacy&#10;Survey images of a sample of 9 QPE host galaxies and a sample of 13 TDE host&#10;galaxies, and model their surface brightness profiles. We show that QPE host&#10;galaxies have high Sersic indices of ~3, high B/T ratios of ~0.5, and high&#10;surface mass densities of ~10^10 Msun kpc^&#45;2. These properties are similar to&#10;TDE host galaxies, but are in strong contrast to a mass&#45; and redshift&#45;matched&#10;control sample of galaxies. We also find tentative evidence that the central&#10;black holes in both QPE and TDE host galaxies are undermassive relative to&#10;their stellar mass. The morphological similarities between QPE and TDE host&#10;galaxies at the population level add to the mounting evidence of a physical&#10;link between these phenomena, and favor QPE models that also invoke TDEs.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10486v1) |&#10;| Tuning the Rate of Tightly Packed Systems To Produce Planet Occurrence&#10; &#160;Trends with Galactic Height | Sarah Ballard | &#160;&#160;The formation of planetary systems has historically been considered in&#10;isolation, decoupled from processes on galactic scales. Recent findings&#10;employing data from ESA&#39;s Gaia mission challenge this narrative, identifying&#10;trends in planet occurrence with galactic kinematics and stellar age. The&#10;findings indicate changes in planet occurrence over and above the predicted&#10;changes from metallicity variation within the Milky Way, so that changes to&#10;stellar metallicity alone (long understood to be deterministic in planet&#10;outcomes) cannot explain the trends entirely. The scope of potential factors&#10;influencing planet formation has grown progressively wider, with accompanying&#10;theoretical support for galactic&#45;scale influences upon planet formation. In&#10;this manuscript, we investigate specifically how changes to the rate of Systems&#10;of Tightly&#45;packed Inner Planets (STIPs) could manifest as a trend in planet&#10;occurrence with galactic height. We focus our study upon M dwarf planetary&#10;systems for two reasons: first, they host STIPs at high rates, and secondly,&#10;their longevity makes them useful probes for kinematic trends over Gyr. We&#10;consider two models for a varying STIP rate: one in which STIP likelihood is&#10;determined by stellar age alone, irrespective of galactic time, and another in&#10;which the STIP likelihood suddenly increased in recent galactic history. Both&#10;models, which impose a higher STIP likelihood among younger stars, produce a&#10;negative gradient in planet occurrence with increasing height from the galactic&#10;midplane. We find that a step function model in which STIP likelihood increased&#10;by a factor of several ~a few Gyr ago resembles an observed trend among FGK&#10;dwarfs. We consider plausible physical mechanisms that could mimic the&#10;hypothesized model, given known links between STIP occurrence and other stellar&#10;and planetary properties.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10485v1) |&#10;| XLM for Autonomous Driving Systems: A Comprehensive Review | Sonda Fourati, Wael Jaafar, Noura Baccar, Safwan Alfattani | &#160;&#160;Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable proficiency in various&#10;information&#45;processing tasks. These tasks span from extracting data and&#10;summarizing literature to generating content, predictive modeling,&#10;decision&#45;making, and system controls. Moreover, Vision Large Models (VLMs) and&#10;Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which represent the next generation of language&#10;models, a.k.a., XLMs, can combine and integrate many data modalities with the&#10;strength of language understanding, thus advancing several information&#45;based&#10;systems, such as Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). Indeed, by combining&#10;language communication with multimodal sensory inputs, e.g., panoramic images&#10;and LiDAR or radar data, accurate driving actions can be taken. In this&#10;context, we provide in this survey paper a comprehensive overview of the&#10;potential of XLMs towards achieving autonomous driving. Specifically, we review&#10;the relevant literature on ADS and XLMs, including their architectures, tools,&#10;and frameworks. Then, we detail the proposed approaches to deploy XLMs for&#10;autonomous driving solutions. Finally, we provide the related challenges to XLM&#10;deployment for ADS and point to future research directions aiming to enable XLM&#10;adoption in future ADS frameworks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10484v1) |&#10;| Efficient polarizable QM/MM using the direct reaction field Hamiltonian&#10; &#160;with electrostatic potential fitted multipole operators | Thomas P. Fay, Nicolas Ferré, Miquel Huix&#45;Rotllant | &#160;&#160;Electronic polarization and dispersion are decisive actors in determining&#10;interaction energies between molecules. These interactions have a particularly&#10;profound effect on excitation energies of molecules in complex environments,&#10;especially when the excitation involves a significant degree of charge&#10;reorganisation. The direct reaction field (DRF) approach, which has seen a&#10;recent revival of interest, provides a powerful framework for describing these&#10;interactions in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models of&#10;systems, where a small subsystem of interest is described using quantum&#10;chemical methods and the remainder is treated with a simple MM force field. In&#10;this paper we show how the DRF approach can be combined with the electrostatic&#10;potential fitted (ESPF) multipole operator description of the QM region charge&#10;density, which reduces the scaling $mathcal{O}(N_mathrm{MM}^3)$ of the method&#10;with MM system to $mathcal{O}(N_mathrm{MM}^2)$. We also show how the DRF&#10;approach can be combined with fluctuating charge descriptions of the&#10;polarizable environment, as well as previously used atom&#45;centred&#10;dipole&#45;polarizability based models. We further show that the ESPF&#45;DRF method&#10;provides an accurate description of molecular interactions in both ground and&#10;excited electronic states of the QM system and apply it to predict the gas to&#10;aqueous solution solvatochromic shifts in the UV/visible absorption spectrum of&#10;acrolein.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10483v1) |&#10;| Schrodinger&#39;s Memory: Large Language Models | Wei Wang, Qing Li | &#160;&#160;Memory is the foundation of LLMs&#39; functionality, yet past research has lacked&#10;an in&#45;depth exploration of their memory capabilities and underlying theory.

Through extensive experiments, we validate our&#10;theory and the memory abilities of LLMs. Finally, we compare the capabilities&#10;of the human brain and LLMs, highlighting both their similarities and&#10;differences in terms of working mechanisms.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10482v1) |&#10;| Exploring 3D Face Reconstruction and Fusion Methods for Face&#10; &#160;Verification: A Case&#45;Study in Video Surveillance | Simone Maurizio La Cava, Sara Concas, Ruben Tolosana, Roberto Casula, Giulia Orrù, Martin Drahansky, Julian Fierrez, Gian Luca Marcialis | &#160;&#160;3D face reconstruction (3DFR) algorithms are based on specific assumptions&#10;tailored to distinct application scenarios. These assumptions limit their use&#10;when acquisition conditions, such as the subject&#39;s distance from the camera or&#10;the camera&#39;s characteristics, are different than expected, as typically happens&#10;in video surveillance. Additionally, 3DFR algorithms follow various strategies&#10;to address the reconstruction of a 3D shape from 2D data, such as statistical&#10;model fitting, photometric stereo, or deep learning. In the present study, we&#10;explore the application of three 3DFR algorithms representative of the SOTA,&#10;employing each one as the template set generator for a face verification&#10;system. The scores provided by each system are combined by score&#45;level fusion.&#10;We show that the complementarity induced by different 3DFR algorithms improves&#10;performance when tests are conducted at never&#45;seen&#45;before distances from the&#10;camera and camera characteristics (cross&#45;distance and cross&#45;camera settings),&#10;thus encouraging further investigations on multiple 3DFR&#45;based approaches.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10481v1) |&#10;| Addressing misspecification in contextual optimization | Omar Bennouna, Jiawei Zhang, Saurabh Amin, Asuman Ozdaglar | &#160;&#160;We study a linear contextual optimization problem where a decision maker has&#10;access to historical data and contextual features to learn a cost prediction&#10;model aimed at minimizing decision error. We adopt the predict&#45;then&#45;optimize&#10;framework for this analysis. Given that perfect model alignment with reality is&#10;often unrealistic in practice, we focus on scenarios where the chosen&#10;hypothesis set is misspecified. In this context, it remains unclear whether&#10;current contextual optimization approaches can effectively address such model&#10;misspecification. In this paper, we present a novel integrated learning and&#10;optimization approach designed to tackle model misspecification in contextual&#10;optimization. This approach offers theoretical generalizability, tractability,&#10;and optimality guarantees, along with strong practical performance. Our method&#10;involves minimizing a tractable surrogate loss that aligns with the performance&#10;value from cost vector predictions, regardless of whether the model&#10;misspecified or not, and can be optimized in reasonable time. To our knowledge,&#10;no previous work has provided an approach with such guarantees in the context&#10;of model misspecification.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10479v1) |&#10;| Local SGD for Near&#45;Quadratic Problems: Improving Convergence under&#10; &#160;Unconstrained Noise Conditions | Andrey Sadchikov, Savelii Chezhegov, Aleksandr Beznosikov, Alexander Gasnikov | &#160;&#160;Distributed optimization plays an important role in modern large&#45;scale&#10;machine learning and data processing systems by optimizing the utilization of&#10;computational resources. One of the classical and popular approaches is Local&#10;Stochastic Gradient Descent (Local SGD), characterized by multiple local&#10;updates before averaging, which is particularly useful in distributed&#10;environments to reduce communication bottlenecks and improve scalability. A&#10;typical feature of this method is the dependence on the frequency of&#10;communications. But in the case of a quadratic target function with homogeneous&#10;data distribution over all devices, the influence of frequency of&#10;communications vanishes. As a natural consequence, subsequent studies include&#10;the assumption of a Lipschitz Hessian, as this indicates the similarity of the&#10;optimized function to a quadratic one to some extent. However, in order to&#10;extend the completeness of the Local SGD theory and unlock its potential, in&#10;this paper we abandon the Lipschitz Hessian assumption by introducing a new&#10;concept of $textit{approximate quadraticity}$. This assumption gives a new&#10;perspective on problems that have near quadratic properties. In addition,&#10;existing theoretical analyses of Local SGD often assume bounded variance. We,&#10;in turn, consider the unbounded noise condition, which allows us to broaden the&#10;class of studied problems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10478v1) |&#10;| SimInversion: A Simple Framework for Inversion&#45;Based Text&#45;to&#45;Image&#10; &#160;Editing | Qi Qian, Haiyang Xu, Ming Yan, Juhua Hu | &#160;&#160;Diffusion models demonstrate impressive image generation performance with&#10;text guidance. Inspired by the learning process of diffusion, existing images&#10;can be edited according to text by DDIM inversion. However, the vanilla DDIM&#10;inversion is not optimized for classifier&#45;free guidance and the accumulated&#10;error will result in the undesired performance. While many algorithms are&#10;developed to improve the framework of DDIM inversion for editing, in this work,&#10;we investigate the approximation error in DDIM inversion and propose to&#10;disentangle the guidance scale for the source and target branches to reduce the&#10;error while keeping the original framework. Moreover, a better guidance scale&#10;(i.e., 0.5) than default settings can be derived theoretically. Experiments on&#10;PIE&#45;Bench show that our proposal can improve the performance of DDIM inversion&#10;dramatically without sacrificing efficiency.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10476v1) |&#10;| Leadership and Engagement Dynamics in Legislative Twitter Networks:&#10; &#160;Statistical Analysis and Modeling | Carolina Luque, Juan Sosa | &#160;&#160;In this manuscript, we analyze the interaction network on Twitter among&#10;members of the 117th U.S. Congress to assess the visibility of political&#10;leaders and explore how systemic properties and node attributes influence the&#10;formation of legislative connections. We employ descriptive social network&#10;statistical methods, the exponential random graph model (ERGM), and the&#10;stochastic block model (SBM) to evaluate the relative impact of network&#10;systemic properties, as well as institutional and personal traits, on the&#10;generation of online relationships among legislators. Our findings reveal that&#10;legislative networks on social media platforms like Twitter tend to reinforce&#10;the leadership of dominant political actors rather than diminishing their&#10;influence. However, we identify that these leadership roles can manifest in&#10;various forms. Additionally, we highlight that online connections within&#10;legislative networks are influenced by both the systemic properties of the&#10;network and institutional characteristics.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10475v1) |&#10;| MacDiff: Unified Skeleton Modeling with Masked Conditional Diffusion | Lehong Wu, Lilang Lin, Jiahang Zhang, Yiyang Ma, Jiaying Liu | &#160;&#160;Self&#45;supervised learning has proved effective for skeleton&#45;based human action&#10;understanding. However, previous works either rely on contrastive learning that&#10;suffers false negative problems or are based on reconstruction that learns too&#10;much unessential low&#45;level clues, leading to limited representations for&#10;downstream tasks. Recently, great advances have been made in generative&#10;learning, which is naturally a challenging yet meaningful pretext task to model&#10;the general underlying data distributions. However, the representation learning&#10;capacity of generative models is under&#45;explored, especially for the skeletons&#10;with spacial sparsity and temporal redundancy. To this end, we propose Masked&#10;Conditional Diffusion (MacDiff) as a unified framework for human skeleton&#10;modeling. For the first time, we leverage diffusion models as effective&#10;skeleton representation learners. Specifically, we train a diffusion decoder&#10;conditioned on the representations extracted by a semantic encoder. Random&#10;masking is applied to encoder inputs to introduce a information bottleneck and&#10;remove redundancy of skeletons. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that&#10;our generative objective involves the contrastive learning objective which&#10;aligns the masked and noisy views. Meanwhile, it also enforces the&#10;representation to complement for the noisy view, leading to better&#10;generalization performance. MacDiff achieves state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art performance on&#10;representation learning benchmarks while maintaining the competence for&#10;generative tasks. Moreover, we leverage the diffusion model for data&#10;augmentation, significantly enhancing the fine&#45;tuning performance in scenarios&#10;with scarce labeled data.

Hassan | &#160;&#160;The proliferation of open Pre&#45;trained Language Models (PTLMs) on model&#10;registry platforms like Hugging Face (HF) presents both opportunities and&#10;challenges for companies building products around them. Similar to traditional&#10;software dependencies, PTLMs continue to evolve after a release. However, the&#10;current state of release practices of PTLMs on model registry platforms are&#10;plagued by a variety of inconsistencies, such as ambiguous naming conventions&#10;and inaccessible model training documentation. Given the knowledge gap on&#10;current PTLM release practices, our empirical study uses a mixed&#45;methods&#10;approach to analyze the releases of 52,227 PTLMs on the most well&#45;known model&#10;registry, HF. Our results reveal 148 different naming practices for PTLM&#10;releases, with 40.87% of changes to model weight files not represented in the&#10;adopted name&#45;based versioning practice or their documentation. In addition, we&#10;identified that the 52,227 PTLMs are derived from only 299 different base&#10;models (the modified original models used to create 52,227 PTLMs), with&#10;Fine&#45;tuning and Quantization being the most prevalent modification methods&#10;applied to these base models. Significant gaps in release transparency, in&#10;terms of training dataset specifications and model card availability, still&#10;exist, highlighting the need for standardized documentation. While we&#10;identified a model naming practice explicitly differentiating between major and&#10;minor PTLM releases, we did not find any significant difference in the types of&#10;changes that went into either type of releases, suggesting that major/minor&#10;version numbers for PTLMs often are chosen arbitrarily. Our findings provide&#10;valuable insights to improve PTLM release practices, nudging the field towards&#10;more formal semantic versioning practices.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10472v1) |&#10;| Real&#45;Time Whole&#45;Body Control of Legged Robots with Model&#45;Predictive Path&#10; &#160;Integral Control | Juan Alvarez&#45;Padilla, John Z.

F. Lizarraga, Flavia M. D. Marquitti, Marcus A. M. de Aguiar | &#160;&#160;We investigate the role of assortative mating in speciation using the&#10;sympatric model of Derrida and Higgs. The model explores the idea that genetic&#10;differences create incompatibilities between individuals, preventing mating if&#10;the number of such differences is too large. Speciation, however, only happens&#10;in this mating system if the number of genes is large. Here we show that&#10;speciation with small genome sizes can occur if assortative mating is&#10;introduced. In our model individuals are represented by three chromosomes: one&#10;responsible for reproductive compatibility, one for coding the trait on which&#10;assortativity will operate, and a neutral chromosome. Reproduction is possible&#10;if individuals are genetically similar with respect to the first chromosome,&#10;but among these compatible mating partners, the one with the most similar trait&#10;coded by the second chromosome is selected. We show that this type of&#10;assortativity facilitates speciation, which can happen with a small number of&#10;genes in the first chromosome. Species, classified according to reproductive&#10;isolation, dictated by the first chromosome, can display different traits&#10;values, as measured by the second and the third chromosomes. Therefore, species&#10;can also be identified based on similarity of the neutral trait, which works as&#10;a proxy for reproductive isolation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10466v1) |&#10;| A stabilized total pressure&#45;formulation of the Biot&#39;s poroelasticity&#10; &#160;equations in frequency domain: numerical analysis and applications | Cristian Cárcamo, Alfonso Caiazzo, Felipe Galarce, Joaquín Mura | &#160;&#160;This work focuses on the numerical solution of the dynamics of a poroelastic&#10;material in the frequency domain. We provide a detailed stability analysis&#10;based on the application of the Fredholm alternative in the continuous case,&#10;considering a total pressure formulation of the Biot&#39;s equations. In the&#10;discrete setting, we propose a stabilized equal order finite element method&#10;complemented by an additional pressure stabilization to enhance the robustness&#10;of the numerical scheme with respect to the fluid permeability. Utilizing the&#10;Fredholm alternative, we extend the well&#45;posedness results to the discrete&#10;setting, obtaining theoretical optimal convergence for the case of linear&#10;finite elements. We present different numerical experiments to validate the&#10;proposed method. First, we consider model problems with known analytic&#10;solutions in two and three dimensions. As next, we show that the method is&#10;robust for a wide range of permeabilities, including the case of discontinuous&#10;coefficients. Lastly, we show the application for the simulation of brain&#10;elastography on a realistic brain geometry obtained from medical imaging.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10465v1) |&#10;| New Direct Sum Tests | Alek Westover, Edward Yu, Kai Zheng | &#160;&#160;A function $f:[n]^{d} to mathbb{F}_2$ is a defn{direct sum} if there are&#10;functions $L_i:[n]to mathbb{F}_2$ such that ${f(x) = sum_{i}L_i(x_i)}$. In&#10;this work we give multiple results related to the property testing of direct&#10;sums.&#10; &#160;Our first result concerns a test proposed by Dinur and Golubev in 2019. We&#10;call their test the Diamond test and show that it is indeed a direct sum&#10;tester. More specifically, we show that if a function $f$ is $epsilon$&#45;far&#10;from being a direct sum function, then the Diamond test rejects $f$ with&#10;probability at least $Omega_{n,epsilon}(1)$. Even in the case of $n = 2$, the&#10;Diamond test is, to the best of our knowledge, novel and yields a new tester&#10;for the classic property of affinity.&#10; &#160;Apart from the Diamond test, we also analyze a broad family of direct sum&#10;tests, which at a high level, run an arbitrary affinity test on the restriction&#10;of $f$ to a random hypercube inside of $[n]^d$. This family of tests includes&#10;the direct sum test analyzed in cite{di19}, but does not include the Diamond&#10;test. As an application of our result, we obtain a direct sum test which works&#10;in the online adversary model of cite{KRV}.&#10; &#160;Finally, we also discuss a Fourier analytic interpretation of the diamond&#10;tester in the $n=2$ case, as well as prove local correction results for direct&#10;sum as conjectured by Dinur and Golubev.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10464v1) |&#10;| Kolmogorov&#45;Arnold Networks in Low&#45;Data Regimes: A Comparative Study with&#10; &#160;Multilayer Perceptrons | Farhad Pourkamali&#45;Anaraki | &#160;&#160;Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) have long been a cornerstone in deep learning,&#10;known for their capacity to model complex relationships. Recently,&#10;Kolmogorov&#45;Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a compelling alternative,&#10;utilizing highly flexible learnable activation functions directly on network&#10;edges, a departure from the neuron&#45;centric approach of MLPs. However, KANs&#10;significantly increase the number of learnable parameters, raising concerns&#10;about their effectiveness in data&#45;scarce environments. This paper presents a&#10;comprehensive comparative study of MLPs and KANs from both algorithmic and&#10;experimental perspectives, with a focus on low&#45;data regimes. We introduce an&#10;effective technique for designing MLPs with unique, parameterized activation&#10;functions for each neuron, enabling a more balanced comparison with KANs. Using&#10;empirical evaluations on simulated data and two real&#45;world data sets from&#10;medicine and engineering, we explore the trade&#45;offs between model complexity&#10;and accuracy, with particular attention to the role of network depth. Our&#10;findings show that MLPs with individualized activation functions achieve&#10;significantly higher predictive accuracy with only a modest increase in&#10;parameters, especially when the sample size is limited to around one hundred.&#10;For example, in a three&#45;class classification problem within additive&#10;manufacturing, MLPs achieve a median accuracy of 0.91, significantly&#10;outperforming KANs, which only reach a median accuracy of 0.53 with default&#10;hyperparameters. These results offer valuable insights into the impact of&#10;activation function selection in neural networks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10463v1) |&#10;| Effects of synapse location, delay and background stochastic activity on&#10; &#160;synchronising hippocampal CA1 neurons | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore | &#160;&#160;We study the synchronisation of neurons in a realistic model under the&#10;Hodgkin&#45;Huxley dynamics. To focus on the role of the different locations of the&#10;excitatory synapses, we use two identical neurons where the set of input&#10;signals is grouped at two different distances from the soma. The system is&#10;intended to represent a CA1 hippocampal neuron in which the synapses arriving&#10;from the CA3 neurons of the trisynaptic pathway appear to be localised in the&#10;apical dendritic region and are, in principle, either proximal or distal to the&#10;soma. Synchronisation is studied using a specifically defined spiking&#10;correlation function as a function of various parameters such as the distance&#10;from the soma of one of the synaptic groups, the inhibition weight and the&#10;associated activation delay. We found that the neurons&#39; spiking activity&#10;depends nonmonotonically on the relative dendritic location of the synapses and&#10;their inhibitory weight, whereas the synchronisation measure always decreases&#10;with inhibition, and strongly depends on its activation time delay. The&#10;background activity on the somas results essentially independent on the&#10;fluctuation intensity and strongly support the importance of the balance&#10;between inhibition and excitation for neuronal synchronization.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10460v1) |&#10;| Efficiently Crowdsourcing Visual Importance with Punch&#45;Hole Annotation | Minsuk Chang, Soohyun Lee, Aeri Cho, Hyeon Jeon, Seokhyeon Park, Cindy Xiong Bearfield, Jinwook Seo | &#160;&#160;We introduce a novel crowdsourcing method for identifying important areas in&#10;graphical images through punch&#45;hole labeling. Traditional methods, such as gaze&#10;trackers and mouse&#45;based annotations, which generate continuous data, can be&#10;impractical in crowdsourcing scenarios. They require many participants, and the&#10;outcome data can be noisy. In contrast, our method first segments the graphical&#10;image with a grid and drops a portion of the patches (punch holes). Then, we&#10;iteratively ask the labeler to validate each annotation with holes, narrowing&#10;down the annotation only having the most important area. This approach aims to&#10;reduce annotation noise in crowdsourcing by standardizing the annotations while&#10;enhancing labeling efficiency and reliability. Preliminary findings from&#10;fundamental charts demonstrate that punch&#45;hole labeling can effectively&#10;pinpoint critical regions. This also highlights its potential for broader&#10;application in visualization research, particularly in studying large&#45;scale&#10;users&#39; graphical perception. Our future work aims to enhance the algorithm to&#10;achieve faster labeling speed and prove its utility through large&#45;scale&#10;experiments.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10459v1) |&#10;| Full distribution of local observables in an exactly solvable current&#10; &#160;carrying steady states of a driven XXZ chain | Sandipan Manna, G J Sreejith | &#160;&#160;Current carrying steady states of interacting spins chains exhibit rich&#10;structures generated through an interplay of current induced correlations and&#10;energetic constraints from the Hamiltonian. The XXZ spin chain when coupled to&#10;maximally polarizing Lindblad terms admits an exact solution in a matrix&#10;product state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations&#10;and distributions of simple local spin observables in the non equilibrium&#10;steady state (NESS). We present exact expressions for spin correlators, entropy&#10;per site, cumulant generating functions for distributions of local observables&#10;in the XX limit (Ising anisotropy $Delta=0$). Further, we use the exact MPS&#10;solution in systems with $Delta&gt;0$, to numerically exactly calculate the&#10;entropy, correlations, as well as distributions of spin observables in blocks&#10;as large as $nsim 200$ sites allowing an estimation of the rate functions. The&#10;$z$ magnetization distribution is consistant with short range spin correlations&#10;in the $z$ direction while the $x$&#45;magnetization shows a double peak structure&#10;at larger $Delta$ suggesting short range ferromagnetic ordering. We find that&#10;the distribution of $z$&#45;magnetization sharpens for parameters where the current&#10;is maximized.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10458v1) |&#10;| Mean Residual Life Ageing Intensity Function | Ashutosh Singh, Ishapathik Das, Asok Kumar Nanda, Sumen Sen | &#160;&#160;The ageing intensity function is a powerful analytical tool that provides&#10;valuable insights into the ageing process across diverse domains such as&#10;reliability engineering, actuarial science, and healthcare. Its applications&#10;continue to expand as researchers delve deeper into understanding the complex&#10;dynamics of ageing and its implications for society. One common approach to&#10;defining the ageing intensity function is through the hazard rate or failure&#10;rate function, extensively explored in scholarly literature. Equally&#10;significant to the hazard rate function is the mean residual life function,&#10;which plays a crucial role in analyzing the ageing patterns exhibited by units&#10;or components. This article introduces the mean residual life ageing intensity&#10;(MRLAI) function to delve into component ageing behaviours across various&#10;distributions. Additionally, we scrutinize the closure properties of the MRLAI&#10;function across different reliability operations. Furthermore, a new order&#10;termed the mean residual life ageing intensity order is defined to analyze the&#10;ageing behaviour of a system, and the closure property of this order under&#10;various reliability operations is discussed.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10456v1) |&#10;| Quantile Fourier regressions for decision making under uncertainty | Arash Khojaste, Geoffrey Pritchard, Golbon Zakeri | &#160;&#160;Weconsider Markov decision processes arising from a Markov model of an&#10;underlying natural phenomenon. Such phenomena are usually periodic (e.g.&#10;annual) in time, and so the Markov processes modelling them must be&#10;time&#45;inhomogeneous, with cyclostationary rather than stationary behaviour. We&#10;describe a technique for constructing such processes that allows for periodic&#10;variations both in the values taken by the process and in the serial dependence&#10;structure. We include two illustrative numerical examples: a hydropower&#10;scheduling problem and a model of offshore wind power integration.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10455v1) |&#10;| The Debiased Near&#45;Earth Object Population from ATLAS Telescopes | Rogerio Deienno, Larry Denneau, David Nesvorný, David Vokrouhlický, William F. Bottke, Robert Jedicke, Shantanu Naidu, Steven R. Chesley, Davide Farnocchia, Paul W. Chodas | &#160;&#160;This work is dedicated to debias the Near&#45;Earth Objects (NEO) population&#10;based on observations from the Asteroid Terrestrial&#45;impact Last Alert System&#10;(ATLAS) telescopes. We have applied similar methods used to develop the&#10;recently released NEO model generator (NEOMOD), once debiasing the NEO&#10;population using data from Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) G96 telescope. ATLAS is&#10;composed of four different telescopes. We first analyzed observational data&#10;from each of all four telescopes separately and later combined them. Our&#10;results highlight main differences between CSS and ATLAS, e.g., sky coverage&#10;and survey power at debiasing the NEO population. ATLAS has a much larger sky&#10;coverage than CSS, allowing it to find bright NEOs that would be constantly&#10;&quot;hiding&quot; from CSS. Consequently, ATLAS is more powerful than CSS at debiasing&#10;the NEO population for H $&#10;esssim$ 19. With its intrinsically greater&#10;sensitivity and emphasis on observing near opposition, CSS excels in the&#10;debiasing of smaller objects. ATLAS, as an all sky survey designed to find&#10;imminent hazardous objects, necessarily spends a significant fraction of time&#10;looking at places on the sky where objects do not appear, reducing its power&#10;for debiasing the population of small objects. We estimate a NEO population&#10;completeness of $approx$ 88%$^{+3%}_{&#45;2%}$ for H $&lt;$ 17.75 and $approx$&#10;36%$^{+1%}_{&#45;1%}$ for H $&lt;$ 22.25. Those numbers are similar to previous&#10;estimates (within error bars for H $&lt;$ 17.75) from CSS, yet, around 3% and 8%&#10;smaller at their face values, respectively. We also confirm previous finding&#10;that the $&#10;u_6$ secular resonance is the main source of small and faint NEOs&#10;at H = 28, whereas the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter dominates for&#10;larger and brighter NEOs at H = 15.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10453v1) |&#10;| Signed Graph Autoencoder for Explainable and Polarization&#45;Aware Network&#10; &#160;Embeddings | Nikolaos Nakis, Chrysoula Kosma, Giannis Nikolentzos, Michalis Chatzianastasis, Iakovos Evdaimon, Michalis Vazirgiannis | &#160;&#160;Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant&#10;attention in recent years for their ability to extract informative latent&#10;representations, characterizing the structure of complex topologies, such as&#10;graphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited&#10;focus on developing and evaluating explainable neural&#45;based graph generative&#10;models specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we&#10;propose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE&#10;extracts node&#45;level representations that express node memberships over distinct&#10;extreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is&#10;achieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its&#10;polarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for&#10;analyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with&#10;relational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation&#10;demonstrates the SGAAEs&#39; capability to successfully infer node memberships over&#10;the different underlying latent structures while extracting competing&#10;communities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the&#10;network. Additionally, we introduce the 2&#45;level network polarization problem&#10;and show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model&#10;achieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across&#10;four real&#45;world datasets, outperforming several baseline models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10452v1) |&#10;| Why you should also use OLS estimation of tail exponents | Thiago Trafane Oliveira Santos, Daniel Oliveira Cajueiro | &#160;&#160;Even though practitioners often estimate Pareto exponents running OLS&#10;rank&#45;size regressions, the usual recommendation is to use the Hill MLE with a&#10;small&#45;sample correction instead, due to its unbiasedness and efficiency. In&#10;this paper, we advocate that you should also apply OLS in empirical&#10;applications. On the one hand, we demonstrate that, with a small&#45;sample&#10;correction, the OLS estimator is also unbiased. On the other hand, we show that&#10;the MLE assigns significantly greater weight to smaller observations. This&#10;suggests that the OLS estimator may outperform the MLE in cases where the&#10;distribution is (i) strictly Pareto but only in the upper tail or (ii)&#10;regularly varying rather than strictly Pareto. We substantiate our theoretical&#10;findings with Monte Carlo simulations and real&#45;world applications,&#10;demonstrating the practical relevance of the OLS method in estimating tail&#10;exponents.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10448v1) |&#10;| Hydrodynamic hovering of swimming bacteria above surfaces | Pyae Hein Htet, Debasish Das, Eric Lauga | &#160;&#160;Flagellated bacteria are hydrodynamically attracted to rigid walls, yet past&#10;work shows a &#39;hovering&#39; state where they swim stably at a finite height above&#10;surfaces. We use numerics and theory to reveal the physical origin of hovering.&#10;Simulations first show that hovering requires an elongated cell body and&#10;results from a tilt away from the wall. Theoretical models then identify two&#10;essential asymmetries: the response of width&#45;asymmetric cells to active flows&#10;created by length&#45;asymmetric cells. A minimal model reconciles near and&#10;far&#45;field hydrodynamics, capturing all key features of hovering.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10447v1) |&#10;| KoroT&#45;3E: A Personalized Musical Mnemonics Tool for Enhancing Memory&#10; &#160;Retention of Complex Computer Science Concepts | Xiangzhe Yuan, Jiajun Wang, Siying Hu, Andrew Cheung, Zhicong Lu | &#160;&#160;As the demand for computer science (CS) skills grows, mastering foundational&#10;concepts is crucial yet challenging for novice learners. To address this&#10;challenge, we present KoroT&#45;3E, an AI&#45;based system that creates personalized&#10;musical mnemonics to enhance both memory retention and understanding of&#10;concepts in CS. KoroT&#45;3E enables users to transform complex concepts into&#10;memorable lyrics and compose melodies that suit their musical preferences. We&#10;conducted semi&#45;structured interviews (n=12) to investigate why novice learners&#10;find it challenging to memorize and understand CS concepts. The findings,&#10;combined with constructivist learning theory, established our initial design,&#10;which was then refined following consultations with CS education experts. An&#10;empirical experiment(n=36) showed that those using KoroT&#45;3E (n=18)&#10;significantly outperformed the control group (n=18), with improved memory&#10;efficiency, increased motivation, and a positive learning experience. These&#10;findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating multimodal generative AI&#10;into CS education to create personalized and interactive learning experiences.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10446v1) |&#10;| Deep&#45;Wide Learning Assistance for Insect Pest Classification | Toan Nguyen, Huy Nguyen, Huy Ung, Hieu Ung, Binh Nguyen | &#160;&#160;Accurate insect pest recognition plays a critical role in agriculture. It is&#10;a challenging problem due to the intricate characteristics of insects. In this&#10;paper, we present DeWi, novel learning assistance for insect pest&#10;classification. With a one&#45;stage and alternating training strategy, DeWi&#10;simultaneously improves several Convolutional Neural Networks in two&#10;perspectives: discrimination (by optimizing a triplet margin loss in a&#10;supervised training manner) and generalization (via data augmentation). From&#10;that, DeWi can learn discriminative and in&#45;depth features of insect pests&#10;(deep) yet still generalize well to a large number of insect categories (wide).&#10;Experimental results show that DeWi achieves the highest performances on two&#10;insect pest classification benchmarks (76.44% accuracy on the IP102 dataset&#10;and 99.79% accuracy on the D0 dataset, respectively). In addition, extensive&#10;evaluations and ablation studies are conducted to thoroughly investigate our&#10;DeWi and demonstrate its superiority.

Behavior trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robot&#10;task planning for their modularity and flexibility, but manually designing them&#10;can be effort&#45;intensive. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been&#10;applied in robotic task planning for generating action sequences, but their&#10;ability to generate BTs has not been fully investigated. To this end, We&#10;propose LLM as BT&#45;planner, a novel framework to leverage LLMs for BT generation&#10;in robotic assembly task planning and execution. Four in&#45;context learning&#10;methods are introduced to utilize the natural language processing and inference&#10;capabilities of LLMs to produce task plans in BT format, reducing manual effort&#10;and ensuring robustness and comprehensibility. We also evaluate the performance&#10;of fine&#45;tuned, fewer&#45;parameter LLMs on the same tasks. Experiments in simulated&#10;and real&#45;world settings show that our framework enhances LLMs&#39; performance in&#10;BT generation, improving success rates in BT generation through in&#45;context&#10;learning and supervised fine&#45;tuning.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10444v1) |&#10;| The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration. II.&#10; &#160;Mid&#45;Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy | Karl D. Gordon, G. C. Sloan, Macarena Garcia Marin, Mattia Libralato, George Rieke, Jonathan A. Aguilar, Ralph Bohlin, Misty Cracraft, Marjorie Decleir, Andras Gaspar, David R. Law, Alberto Noriega&#45;Crespo, Michael Regan | &#160;&#160;The absolute flux calibration of the Mid&#45;Infrared Instrument Imaging and&#10;Coronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first&#10;2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the&#10;flux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays,&#10;and different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining&#10;observed aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions&#10;based on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of&#10;these observations were combined with model point&#45;spread&#45;functions to measure&#10;the corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with&#10;time, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time,&#10;rate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations&#10;were with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately&#10;every month revealed a modest time&#45;dependent response loss seen mainly at the&#10;longest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential&#10;with a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the&#10;band&#45;dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was&#10;found to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different&#10;subarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting&#10;for the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors&#10;measured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The&#10;formal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are&#10;0.3 to 1.0%, with longer&#45;wavelength bands generally having larger&#10;uncertainties.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10443v1) |&#10;| CtRNet&#45;X: Camera&#45;to&#45;Robot Pose Estimation in Real&#45;world Conditions Using&#10; &#160;a Single Camera | Jingpei Lu, Zekai Liang, Tristin Xie, Florian Ritcher, Shan Lin, Sainan Liu, Michael C. Yip | &#160;&#160;Camera&#45;to&#45;robot calibration is crucial for vision&#45;based robot control and&#10;requires effort to make it accurate. Recent advancements in markerless pose&#10;estimation methods have eliminated the need for time&#45;consuming physical setups&#10;for camera&#45;to&#45;robot calibration. While the existing markerless pose estimation&#10;methods have demonstrated impressive accuracy without the need for cumbersome&#10;setups, they rely on the assumption that all the robot joints are visible&#10;within the camera&#39;s field of view. However, in practice, robots usually move in&#10;and out of view, and some portion of the robot may stay out&#45;of&#45;frame during the&#10;whole manipulation task due to real&#45;world constraints, leading to a lack of&#10;sufficient visual features and subsequent failure of these approaches. To&#10;address this challenge and enhance the applicability to vision&#45;based robot&#10;control, we propose a novel framework capable of estimating the robot pose with&#10;partially visible robot manipulators. Our approach leverages the&#10;Vision&#45;Language Models for fine&#45;grained robot components detection, and&#10;integrates it into a keypoint&#45;based pose estimation network, which enables more&#10;robust performance in varied operational conditions. The framework is evaluated&#10;on both public robot datasets and self&#45;collected partial&#45;view datasets to&#10;demonstrate our robustness and generalizability. As a result, this method is&#10;effective for robot pose estimation in a wider range of real&#45;world manipulation&#10;scenarios.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10441v1) |&#10;| Successive topological phase transitions in two distinct spin&#45;flop&#10; &#160;phases on the honeycomb lattice | Xudong Li, Jize Zhao, Jinbin Li, Qiang Luo | &#160;&#160;The Kitaev magnets with bond&#45;dependent interactions have garnered&#10;considerable attention in recent years for their ability to harbor exotic&#10;phases and nontrivial excitations. The topological magnons, which are indicated&#10;by nonzero Chern number and thermal Hall conductivity, are proposed to&#10;partially explain thermal Hall measurements in real materials. Hitherto,&#10;topological magnons have been extensively explored when the magnetic field is&#10;normal to the honeycomb plane, but their topological characteristics are less&#10;studied in the presence of in&#45;plane magnetic field. Here, we study two distinct&#10;in&#45;plane field induced spin&#45;flop phases in the $Gamma$&#45;$Gamma&#39;$ model, both&#10;of which are off&#45;diagonal couplings that have intimate relation to the Kitaev&#10;interaction. The two spin&#45;flop phases are distinguished by their out&#45;of&#45;plane&#10;spin components which can be either antiparallel or parallel, thus dubbing&#10;antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) spin&#45;flop phases, respectively.&#10;We map out topological phase diagrams for both phases, revealing a rich pattern&#10;of the Chern number over exchange parameters and magnetic field. We&#10;analytically calculate the boundaries of topological phase transitions when the&#10;magnetic field is along the $a$ and $b$ directions. We find that the thermal&#10;Hall conductivity and its derivative display contrasting behaviors when&#10;crossing different topological phase transitions. The striking difference of&#10;the two phases lies in that when the magnetic field is along the $b$ direction,&#10;topological magnons are totally absent in the AFM spin&#45;flop phase, while they&#10;can survive in the FM analogue in certain parameter regions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10439v1) |&#10;| A functorial approach to $n$&#45;abelian categories | Vitor Gulisz | &#160;&#160;We develop a functorial approach to the study of $n$&#45;abelian categories by&#10;reformulating their axioms in terms of their categories of finitely presented&#10;functors.

Comparing periods in versus out of &quot;lockdown&quot;&#10;restrictions, we show using genetic distance relationships that individuals&#10;from more deprived areas are more likely to get infected during lockdown but&#10;less likely to spread the infection further. As disadvantaged communities were&#10;the most affected by both COVID&#45;19 and its restrictions, our finding has&#10;important implications for informing future approaches to control future&#10;pandemics driven by similar respiratory infections.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10436v1) |&#10;| A study of pure multi&#45;strange hadrons production in Pb+Pb collisions at&#10; &#160;LHC energies using HYDJET++ model | Gauri Devi, B. K. Singh | &#160;&#160;For the present work, we have used the HYDJET++ model to explore the&#10;production of pure multi&#45;strange hadrons in Pb+Pb collisions at&#10;$sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 2.76 TeV and $sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 5.02 TeV collision energies,&#10;respectively. We have simulated the $p_{T}$&#45;spectra and elliptic flow ($v_{2}$)&#10;of $phi$&#45;meson and $Omega$&#45;baryons comparing our results with ALICE&#10;experimental data and several phenomenological models (HIJING/$Boverline{B}$,&#10;VISHNU, EPOS, AMPT, and Krakow) across various centrality intervals.&#10;Additionally, we have calculated the nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$ and&#10;$R_{CP}$), which provide a perception of jet quenching phenomena. Hence, our&#10;findings enable the study of the energy and system dependence of $phi$ and&#10;$Omega$ hadrons production over a wide range of ultra&#45;relativistic collision&#10;energies. We also present the particle ratios ($Omega/phi$,&#10;$overline{Omega}^{+}/Omega^{&#45;}$, $Omega/pi$, and $phi/pi$), offering&#10;insights on the strangeness enhancement and chemical properties of the medium&#10;at both LHC collision energies.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10435v1) |&#10;| Magnetic metamaterials by ion&#45;implantation | Christina Vantaraki, Petter Ström, Tuan T. Tran, Matías P. Grassi, Giovanni Fevola, Michael Foerster, Jerzy T. Sadowski, Daniel Primetzhofer, Vassilios Kapaklis | &#160;&#160;We present a method for the additive fabrication of planar magnetic&#10;nanoarrays with minimal surface roughness. Synthesis is accomplished by&#10;combining electron&#45;beam lithography, used to generate nanometric patterned&#10;masks, with ion implantation in thin films. By implanting $^{56}$Fe$^{+}$ ions,&#10;we are able to introduce magnetic functionality in a controlled manner into&#10;continuous Pd thin films, achieving 3D spatial resolution down to a few tens of&#10;nanometers. Our results demonstrate the successful application of this&#10;technique in fabricating square artificial spin ice lattices, which exhibit&#10;well&#45;defined magnetization textures and interactions among the patterned&#10;magnetic elements.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10433v1) |&#10;| Structure&#45;preserving learning for multi&#45;symplectic PDEs | Süleyman Yıldız, Pawan Goyal, Peter Benner | &#160;&#160;This paper presents an energy&#45;preserving machine learning method for&#10;inferring reduced&#45;order models (ROMs) by exploiting the multi&#45;symplectic form&#10;of partial differential equations (PDEs). The vast majority of&#10;energy&#45;preserving reduced&#45;order methods use symplectic Galerkin projection to&#10;construct reduced&#45;order Hamiltonian models by projecting the full models onto a&#10;symplectic subspace. However, symplectic projection requires the existence of&#10;fully discrete operators, and in many cases, such as black&#45;box PDE solvers,&#10;these operators are inaccessible. In this work, we propose an energy&#45;preserving&#10;machine learning method that can infer the dynamics of the given PDE using data&#10;only, so that the proposed framework does not depend on the fully discrete&#10;operators. In this context, the proposed method is non&#45;intrusive. The proposed&#10;method is grey box in the sense that it requires only some basic knowledge of&#10;the multi&#45;symplectic model at the partial differential equation level. We prove&#10;that the proposed method satisfies spatially discrete local energy conservation&#10;and preserves the multi&#45;symplectic conservation laws. We test our method on the&#10;linear wave equation, the Korteweg&#45;de Vries equation, and the&#10;Zakharov&#45;Kuznetsov equation. We test the generalization of our learned models&#10;by testing them far outside the training time interval.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10432v1) |&#10;| Hippocampal synchronization in a realistic CA1 neuron model | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore | &#160;&#160;This work delves into studying the synchronization in two realistic neuron&#10;models using Hodgkin&#45;Huxley dynamics. Unlike simplistic point&#45;like models,&#10;excitatory synapses are here randomly distributed along the dendrites,&#10;introducing strong stochastic contributions into their signal propagation. To&#10;focus on the role of different excitatory positions, we use two copies of the&#10;same neuron whose synapses are located at different distances from the soma and&#10;are exposed to identical Poissonian distributed current pulses. The&#10;synchronization is investigated through a specifically defined spiking&#10;correlation function, and its behavior is analyzed as a function of several&#10;parameters: inhibition weight, distance from the soma of one synaptic group,&#10;excitatory inactivation delay, and weight of the excitatory synapses.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10431v1) |&#10;| Meta&#45;Whisper: Speech&#45;Based Meta&#45;ICL for ASR on Low&#45;Resource Languages | Ming&#45;Hao Hsu, Kuan Po Huang, Hung&#45;yi Lee | &#160;&#160;This paper presents Meta&#45;Whisper, a novel approach to improve automatic&#10;speech recognition (ASR) for low&#45;resource languages using the Whisper model. By&#10;leveraging Meta In&#45;Context Learning (Meta&#45;ICL) and a k&#45;Nearest Neighbors (KNN)&#10;algorithm for sample selection, Meta&#45;Whisper enhances Whisper&#39;s ability to&#10;recognize speech in unfamiliar languages without extensive fine&#45;tuning.&#10;Experiments on the ML&#45;SUPERB dataset show that Meta&#45;Whisper significantly&#10;reduces the Character Error Rate (CER) for low&#45;resource languages compared to&#10;the original Whisper model. This method offers a promising solution for&#10;developing more adaptable multilingual ASR systems, particularly for languages&#10;with limited resources.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10429v1) |&#10;| User&#45;Authenticated Device&#45;Independent Quantum Secure Direct&#10; &#160;Communication Protocol | Nayana Das, Saikat Basu, Goutam Paul, Vijay S. Rao | &#160;&#160;Device&#45;Independent Quantum Secure Direct Communication (DI&#45;QSDC) enhances&#10;quantum cryptography by enabling secure message transmission without relying on&#10;the trustworthiness of the devices involved. This approach mitigates risks&#10;associated with compromised or untrusted devices, common in traditional quantum&#10;communication.&#10; &#160;In this paper, we propose the first of its kind DI&#45;QSDC protocol with user&#10;identity authentication. This ensures the authenticity of both the sender and&#10;receiver prior to message exchange. We then discuss the security of the&#10;proposed protocol against common attacks, demonstrating that no eavesdropper&#10;gains any information from either the quantum or the classical channel. Next,&#10;we implement the protocol on IBM&#39;s quantum hardware and evaluate its&#10;performance in a realistic noisy environment. Additionally, by simulating&#10;common attack models, we showcase that the protocol is secure against any&#10;eavesdropper in the channel. These findings highlight the protocol&#39;s robust&#10;security and practical feasibility for real&#45;world secure quantum communication.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10427v1) |&#10;| Role of kinematic constraints in the time reversal symmetry breaking of&#10; &#160;a model active matter | Soumen Das, Shankar Ghosh, Tridib Sadhu, Juliane U Klamser | &#160;&#160;Active&#45;matter systems are inherently out&#45;of&#45;equilibrium and perform&#10;mechanical work by utilizing their internal energy sources. Breakdown of&#10;time&#45;reversal symmetry (BTRS) is a hallmark of such dissipative non&#45;equilibrium&#10;dynamics. We introduce a robust, experimentally accessible, noninvasive,&#10;quantitative measure of BTRS in terms of the Kullback&#45;Leibler divergence in&#10;collision events, demonstrated in our novel artificial active matter, comprised&#10;of battery&#45;powered spherical rolling robots whose energetics in different modes&#10;of motion can be measured with high precision. Our dimensionless measure&#10;characterizes how dissipation and internal energetics are influenced by&#10;kinematic constraints from interactions with the environment. We propose this&#10;measure of BTRS as an empirical estimate of the distance from equilibrium. An&#10;energetic insight into this departure of active matter from equilibrium comes&#10;from our demonstration of a non&#45;trivial fluctuation symmetry, which reveals a&#10;potentially universal thermodynamic characteristic of active energetics. As a&#10;many&#45;body consequence of BTRS in our experimental active system, we demonstrate&#10;the emergence of activity&#45;induced herding, which has no equilibrium analogue.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10425v1) |&#10;| Unveiling V Modes: Enhancing CMB Sensitivity to BSM Physics with a&#10; &#160;Non&#45;Ideal Half&#45;Wave Plate | N. Raffuzzi, M. Lembo, S. Giardiello, M. Gerbino, M. Lattanzi, P. Natoli, L. Pagano | &#160;&#160;V&#45;mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background is expected to be&#10;vanishingly small in the $Lambda$CDM model and, hence, usually ignored.&#10;Nonetheless, several astrophysical effects, as well as beyond standard model&#10;physics could produce it at a detectable level. A realistic half&#45;wave plate &#45;&#10;an optical element commonly used in CMB experiments to modulate the polarized&#10;signal &#45; can provide sensitivity to V modes without significantly spoiling that&#10;to linear polarization. We assess this sensitivity for some new&#45;generation CMB&#10;experiments, such as the LiteBIRD satellite, the ground&#45;based Simons&#10;Observatory and a CMB&#45;S4&#45;like experiment. We forecast the efficiency of these&#10;experiments to constrain the phenomenology of certain classes of BSM models&#10;inducing mixing of linear polarization states and generation of V modes in the&#10;CMB. We find that new&#45;generation experiments can improve current limits by&#10;1&#45;to&#45;3 orders of magnitude, depending on the data combination. The inclusion of&#10;V&#45;mode information dramatically boosts the sensitivity to these BSM models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10424v1) |&#10;| Initial data for a deformed isolated horizon | Aleš Flandera, David Kofroň, Tomáš Ledvinka | &#160;&#160;Within the isolated horizon formalism, we investigate a static axisymmetric&#10;space&#45;time of a black hole influenced by matter in its neighborhood. To&#10;illustrate the role of ingredients and assumptions in this formalism, we first&#10;show how, in spherical symmetry, the field equations and gauge conditions imply&#10;the isolated horizon initial data leading to the Schwarzschild space&#45;time.&#10;Then, we construct the initial data for a static axisymmetric isolated horizon&#10;representing a deformed black hole. The space&#45;time description in the&#10;Bondi&#45;like coordinates is then found as a series expansion in the vicinity of&#10;the horizon. To graphically illustrate this construction, we also find a&#10;numerical solution for a black hole deformed by a particular analytic model of&#10;a thin accretion disk. We also discuss how an accretion disk affects the&#10;analytical properties of the horizon geometry.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10423v1) |&#10;| Learning Semi&#45;Supervised Medical Image Segmentation from Spatial&#10; &#160;Registration | Qianying Liu, Paul Henderson, Xiao Gu, Hang Dai, Fani Deligianni | &#160;&#160;Semi&#45;supervised medical image segmentation has shown promise in training&#10;models with limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. However,&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methods ignore a potentially valuable source of unsupervised&#10;semantic information &#45;&#45; spatial registration transforms between image volumes.&#10;To address this, we propose CCT&#45;R, a contrastive cross&#45;teaching framework&#10;incorporating registration information. To leverage the semantic information&#10;available in registrations between volume pairs, CCT&#45;R incorporates two&#10;proposed modules: Registration Supervision Loss (RSL) and Registration&#45;Enhanced&#10;Positive Sampling (REPS). The RSL leverages segmentation knowledge derived from&#10;transforms between labeled and unlabeled volume pairs, providing an additional&#10;source of pseudo&#45;labels. REPS enhances contrastive learning by identifying&#10;anatomically&#45;corresponding positives across volumes using registration&#10;transforms. Experimental results on two challenging medical segmentation&#10;benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CCT&#45;R across&#10;various semi&#45;supervised settings, with as few as one labeled case.

A number of recent methods have shown&#10;how to perform high&#45;dimensional, unbinned unfolding using machine learning.&#10;However, one of the assumptions in all of these methods is that the detector&#10;response is accurately modeled in the Monte Carlo simulation. In practice, the&#10;detector response depends on a number of nuisance parameters that can be&#10;constrained with data. We propose a new algorithm called Profile OmniFold&#10;(POF), which works in a similar iterative manner as the OmniFold (OF) algorithm&#10;while being able to simultaneously profile the nuisance parameters. We&#10;illustrate the method with a Gaussian example as a proof of concept&#10;highlighting its promising capabilities.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10421v1) |&#10;| HiFi&#45;CS: Towards Open Vocabulary Visual Grounding For Robotic Grasping&#10; &#160;Using Vision&#45;Language Models | Vineet Bhat, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Ramesh Karri, Farshad Khorrami | &#160;&#160;Robots interacting with humans through natural language can unlock numerous&#10;applications such as Referring Grasp Synthesis (RGS). Given a text query, RGS&#10;determines a stable grasp pose to manipulate the referred object in the robot&#39;s&#10;workspace. RGS comprises two steps: visual grounding and grasp pose estimation.&#10;Recent studies leverage powerful Vision&#45;Language Models (VLMs) for visually&#10;grounding free&#45;flowing natural language in real&#45;world robotic execution.&#10;However, comparisons in complex, cluttered environments with multiple instances&#10;of the same object are lacking. This paper introduces HiFi&#45;CS, featuring&#10;hierarchical application of Featurewise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to fuse image&#10;and text embeddings, enhancing visual grounding for complex attribute rich text&#10;queries encountered in robotic grasping. Visual grounding associates an object&#10;in 2D/3D space with natural language input and is studied in two scenarios:&#10;Closed and Open Vocabulary. HiFi&#45;CS features a lightweight decoder combined&#10;with a frozen VLM and outperforms competitive baselines in closed vocabulary&#10;settings while being 100x smaller in size. Our model can effectively guide&#10;open&#45;set object detectors like GroundedSAM to enhance open&#45;vocabulary&#10;performance. We validate our approach through real&#45;world RGS experiments using&#10;a 7&#45;DOF robotic arm, achieving 90.33% visual grounding accuracy in 15 tabletop&#10;scenes.

Papoutsis, I. E. Papadakis, C. Panagiotou, M. Dovčiak, E. Kammoun | &#160;&#160;Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to be variable across all&#10;wavelengths. Significant observational efforts have been invested in the last&#10;decade in studying their ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability. Long and&#10;densely sampled, multi&#45;wavelength monitoring campaigns of numerous Seyfert&#10;galaxies have been conducted with the aim of determining the X&#45;ray/UV/optical&#10;continuum time lags. Time&#45;lag studies can be used to constrain theoretical&#10;models. The observed time lags can be explained by thermal reprocessing of the&#10;X&#45;rays illuminating the accretion disc (known as the X&#45;ray reverberation&#10;model). However, the observed light curves contain more information that can be&#10;used to further constrain physical models. Our primary objective is to&#10;investigate whether, in addition to time lags, the X&#45;ray reverberation model&#10;can also explain the UV/optical variability amplitude of nearby Seyferts. To do&#10;this, we measured the excess variance of four sources (namely Mrk 509, NGC&#10;4151, NGC 2617, and Mrk 142) as a function of wavelength using data from&#10;archival long, multi&#45;wavelength campaigns with Swift, and ground&#45;based&#10;telescopes. We also computed the model excess variance in the case of the X&#45;ray&#10;reverberation model by determining the disc&#39;s transfer function and assuming a&#10;bending power law for the X&#45;ray power spectrum. We tested the validity of the&#10;model by comparing the measured and model variances for a range of accretion&#10;rates and X&#45;ray source heights. We conclude that the X&#45;ray thermal&#10;reverberation model can fit both the continuum, UV/optical time lags, as well&#10;as the variance in these AGNs, for the same physical parameters. Our results&#10;suggest that the accretion disc is constant and that all the observed&#10;UV/optical variations, on timescales of days and up to a few weeks, can be&#10;fully explained by the variable X&#45;rays as they illuminate the accretion disc.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10417v1) |&#10;| Local central limit theorem for Mallows measure | Alexey Bufetov, Kailun Chen | &#160;&#160;We study the statistics of the Mallows measure on permutations in the limit&#10;pioneered by Starr (2009).

We also re&#45;derive versions of the law of large numbers&#10;and the large deviation principle, obtain the standard central limit theorem&#10;from the local one, and establish a multi&#45;point version of the local central&#10;limit theorem.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10415v1) |&#10;| On interactive anisotropic walks in two dimensions generated from a&#10; &#160;three state opinion dynamics model | Surajit Saha, Parongama Sen | &#160;&#160;A system of interacting walkers on a two&#45;dimensional space where the dynamics&#10;of each walker are governed by the opinions of agents of a three&#45;state opinion&#10;dynamics model are considered. Such walks, inspired by Ising&#45;like models and&#10;opinions dynamics models, are usually considered in one&#45;dimensional virtual&#10;spaces. Here, the mapping is done in such a way that the walk is directed along&#10;the $y$ axis while it can move either way along the $x$ axis. We explore the&#10;properties of such walks as the parameter representing the noise in the opinion&#10;dynamics model, responsible for a continuous phase transition, is varied. The&#10;walk features show marked differences as the system crosses the critical point.&#10;The bivariate distribution of the displacements below the critical point is a&#10;modified biased Gaussian function of x and y which is symmetric about the X&#10;axis.&#10; &#160;The marginal probability distributions can be extracted and the scaling forms&#10;of different quantities, showing power law behaviour, are obtained. The&#10;directed nature of the walk is reflected in the marginal distributions as well&#10;as in the exponents.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10413v1) |&#10;| A Large&#45;Scale Privacy Assessment of Android Third&#45;Party SDKs | Mark Huasong Meng, Chuan Yan, Yun Hao, Qing Zhang, Zeyu Wang, Kailong Wang, Sin Gee Teo, Guangdong Bai, Jin Song Dong | &#160;&#160;Third&#45;party Software Development Kits (SDKs) are widely adopted in Android&#10;app development, to effortlessly accelerate development pipelines and enhance&#10;app functionality. However, this convenience raises substantial concerns about&#10;unauthorized access to users&#39; privacy&#45;sensitive information, which could be&#10;further abused for illegitimate purposes like user tracking or monetization.&#10;Our study offers a targeted analysis of user privacy protection among Android&#10;third&#45;party SDKs, filling a critical gap in the Android software supply chain.&#10;It focuses on two aspects of their privacy practices, including data&#10;exfiltration and behavior&#45;policy compliance (or privacy compliance), utilizing&#10;techniques of taint analysis and large language models. It covers 158&#10;widely&#45;used SDKs from two key SDK release platforms, the official one and a&#10;large alternative one. From them, we identified 338 instances of privacy data&#10;exfiltration. On the privacy compliance, our study reveals that more than 30%&#10;of the examined SDKs fail to provide a privacy policy to disclose their data&#10;handling practices. Among those that provide privacy policies, 37% of them&#10;over&#45;collect user data, and 88% falsely claim access to sensitive data. We&#10;revisit the latest versions of the SDKs after 12 months. Our analysis&#10;demonstrates a persistent lack of improvement in these concerning trends. Based&#10;on our findings, we propose three actionable recommendations to mitigate the&#10;privacy leakage risks and enhance privacy protection for Android users. Our&#10;research not only serves as an urgent call for industry attention but also&#10;provides crucial insights for future regulatory interventions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10411v1) |&#10;| A point process approach for the classification of noisy calcium imaging&#10; &#160;data | Arianna Burzacchi, Nicoletta D&#39;Angelo, David Payares&#45;Garcia, Jorge Mateu | &#160;&#160;We study noisy calcium imaging data, with a focus on the classification of&#10;spike traces. As raw traces obscure the true temporal structure of neuron&#39;s&#10;activity, we performed a tuned filtering of the calcium concentration using two&#10;methods: a biophysical model and a kernel mapping. The former characterizes&#10;spike trains related to a particular triggering event, while the latter filters&#10;out the signal and refines the selection of the underlying neuronal response.&#10;Transitioning from traditional time series analysis to point process theory,&#10;the study explores spike&#45;time distance metrics and point pattern prototypes to&#10;describe repeated observations. We assume that the analyzed neuron&#39;s firing&#10;events, i.e. spike occurrences, are temporal point process events. In&#10;particular, the study aims to categorize 47 point patterns by depth, assuming&#10;the similarity of spike occurrences within specific depth categories. The&#10;results highlight the pivotal roles of depth and stimuli in discerning diverse&#10;temporal structures of neuron firing events, confirming the point process&#10;approach based on prototype analysis is largely useful in the classification of&#10;spike traces.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10409v1) |&#10;| Variational closures for composite homogenised fluid flows | Theo Diamantakis, Ruiao Hu | &#160;&#160;The Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport is a variational formulation of&#10;stochastic fluid dynamics introduced to model the effects of unresolved scales,&#10;whilst preserving the geometric structure of ideal fluid flows. In this work,&#10;we show that the SALT equations can arise from the decomposition of the fluid&#10;flow map into its mean and fluctuating components. The fluctuating component is&#10;realised as a prescribed stochastic diffeomorphism that introduces stochastic&#10;transport into the system and we construct it using homogenisation theory. The&#10;dynamics of the mean component are derived from a variational principle&#10;utilising particular forms of variations that preserve the composite structure&#10;of the flow. Using a new variational principle, we show that SALT equations can&#10;arise from random Lagrangians and are equivalent to random coefficient PDEs. We&#10;also demonstrate how to modify the composite flow and the associated&#10;variational principle to derive models inspired by the Lagrangian Averaged&#10;Euler&#45;Poincare (LAEP) theory.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10408v1) |&#10;| Bitcoin Transaction Behavior Modeling Based on Balance Data | Yu Zhang, Claudio Tessone | &#160;&#160;When analyzing Bitcoin users&#39; balance distribution, we observed that it&#10;follows a log&#45;normal pattern. Drawing parallels from the successful application&#10;of Gibrat&#39;s law of proportional growth in explaining city size and word&#10;frequency distributions, we tested whether the same principle could account for&#10;the log&#45;normal distribution in Bitcoin balances. However, our calculations&#10;revealed that the exponent parameters in both the drift and variance terms&#10;deviate slightly from one. This suggests that Gibrat&#39;s proportional growth rule&#10;alone does not fully explain the log&#45;normal distribution observed in Bitcoin&#10;users&#39; balances. During our exploration, we discovered an intriguing&#10;phenomenon: Bitcoin users tend to fall into two distinct categories based on&#10;their behavior, which we refer to as ``poor&quot; and ``wealthy&quot; users. Poor users,&#10;who initially purchase only a small amount of Bitcoin, tend to buy more&#10;bitcoins first and then sell out all their holdings gradually over time. The&#10;certainty of selling all their coins is higher and higher with time. In&#10;contrast, wealthy users, who acquire a large amount of Bitcoin from the start,&#10;tend to sell off their holdings over time. The speed at which they sell their&#10;bitcoins is lower and lower over time and they will hold at least a small part&#10;of their initial holdings at last. Interestingly, the wealthier the user, the&#10;larger the proportion of their balance and the higher the certainty they tend&#10;to sell. This research provided an interesting perspective to explore bitcoin&#10;users&#39; behaviors which may apply to other finance markets.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10407v1) |&#10;| Stochastic Data&#45;Driven Predictive Control: Chance&#45;Constraint&#10; &#160;Satisfaction with Identified Multi&#45;step Predictors | Haldun Balim, Andrea Carron, Melanie N.

Our approach&#10;leverages multi&#45;step predictors to efficiently propagate uncertainty, ensuring&#10;chance constraint satisfaction with minimal conservatism. In particular, we&#10;present a strategy to identify multi&#45;step predictors and quantify the&#10;associated uncertainty using a surrogate (data&#45;driven) state space model. Then,&#10;we utilize the derived distribution to formulate a constraint tightening that&#10;ensures chance constraint satisfaction.

The results show that the&#10;proposed method significantly outperforms existing models across multiple&#10;evaluation metrics, with an F1 score improvement of 2.4% on the CHIP&#45;CTC&#10;dataset, 3.1% on the IMCS&#45;V2&#45;NER dataset,and 4.2% on the KUAKE&#45;QTR dataset.&#10;Additionally,ablation studies confirmed the critical role of the knowledge&#10;injection module,as the removal of this module resulted in a significant drop&#10;in F1 score. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not&#10;only effectively improves the accuracy of disease diagnosis but also enhances&#10;the interpretability of the predictions, providing more reliable support and&#10;evidence for clinical diagnosis.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10403v1) |&#10;| A Statistical Equilibrium Approach to Adam Smith&#39;s Labor Theory of Value | Ellis Scharfenaker, Bruno Theodosio, Duncan K. Foley | &#160;&#160;Adam Smith&#39;s inquiry into the emergence and stability of the&#10;self&#45;organization of the division of labor in commodity production and exchange&#10;is considered using statistical equilibrium methods from statistical physics.&#10;We develop a statistical equilibrium model of the distribution of independent&#10;direct producers in a hub&#45;and&#45;spoke framework that predicts both the center of&#10;gravity of producers across lines of production as well as the endogenous&#10;fluctuations between lines of production that arise from Smith&#39;s concept of&#10;&quot;perfect liberty&quot;. The ergodic distribution of producers implies a long&#45;run&#10;balancing of &quot;advantages to disadvantages&quot; across lines of employment and&#10;gravitation of market prices around Smith&#39;s natural prices.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10402v1) |&#10;| Hydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning in meiosis II&#10; &#160;oocytes | Weida Liao, Eric Lauga | &#160;&#160;Cytoplasmic streaming, the persistent flow of fluid inside a cell, induces&#10;intracellular transport, which plays a key role in fundamental biological&#10;processes. In meiosis II mouse oocytes (developing egg cells) awaiting&#10;fertilisation, the spindle, which is the protein structure responsible for&#10;dividing genetic material in a cell, must maintain its position near the cell&#10;cortex (the thin actin network bound to the cell membrane) for many hours.&#10;However, the cytoplasmic streaming that accompanies this stable positioning&#10;would intuitively appear to destabilise the spindle position. Here, through a&#10;combination of numerical and analytical modelling, we reveal a new,&#10;hydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning beneath the cortical cap.&#10;We show that this stability depends critically on the spindle size and the&#10;active driving from the cortex, and demonstrate that stable spindle positioning&#10;can result purely from a hydrodynamic suction force exerted on the spindle by&#10;the cytoplasmic flow. Our findings show that local fluid dynamic forces can be&#10;sufficient to stabilise the spindle, explaining robustness against&#10;perturbations not only perpendicular but also parallel to the cortex. Our&#10;results shed light on the importance of cytoplasmic streaming in mammalian&#10;meiosis.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10401v1) |&#10;| Sherpa: An Open Source Python Fitting Package | Aneta Siemiginowska, Douglas Burke, Hans Moritz Günther, Nicholas P.

Sherpa&#10;contains powerful tools for combining parametric models into complex&#10;expressions that can be fit to data using a variety of statistics and&#10;optimization methods. It is easily extensible to include user&#45;defined models,&#10;statistics, and optimization methods. It provides a high&#45;level User Interface&#10;for interactive data&#45;analysis, such as within a Jupyter notebook, and it can&#10;also be used as a library component, providing fitting and modeling&#10;capabilities to an application. We include a few examples of Sherpa&#10;applications to multiwavelength astronomical data.

Dejrah | &#160;&#160;We focus on the inflationary predictions of $beta$&#45;exponential potential&#10;models, in which the inflaton is a representation of the field delineating the&#10;size of extra&#45;dimension. Since it offers a well&#45;motivated starting point for&#10;the study of physics at very high energies, we incorporate an $R^2$ term in the&#10;Palatini gravity. In addition, afterward the inflation, the inflaton oscillates&#10;about the minimum of the inflation potential, and reheats the universe. This&#10;occurs during the reheating phase, at which the inflaton decays into the&#10;standard model particles, which fill the universe. We extend our examination by&#10;considering the reheating effects on inflationary observables by employing the&#10;different scenarios of the reheat temperature. Supposing the standard thermal&#10;history after inflation, we display the inflationary predictions, $n_s, r,&#10;mathrm{d}n_s/mathrm{d}&#10;n k$ of $beta$&#45;exponential potential with minimal&#10;coupling in Palatini $R^2$ gravity. Also, different kinds of constraints from a&#10;variety of observations, such as BICEP/Keck, Planck 2018, as well as future&#10;possible detectable sensitivities that might be reached by CMB experiments:&#10;CMB&#45;S4 and LiteBIRD are taken into account in this work. We indicate that our&#10;results are consistent with both the latest data and the future sensitivity&#10;forecasts of LiteBIRD/Planck and CMB&#45;S4. Finally, the results in this study&#10;highlight the viability of our model even in the case of the existence of more&#10;stringent constraints expected from future achievable confidence level limits.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10398v1) |&#10;| Quantifying Observational Projection Effects with a Simulation&#45;based hot&#10; &#160;CGM model | Soumya Shreeram, Johan Comparat, Andrea Merloni, Yi Zhang, Gabriele Ponti, Kirpal Nandra, John ZuHone, Ilaria Marini, Stephan Vladutescu&#45;Zopp, Paola Popesso, Ruediger Pakmor, Riccardo Seppi, Celine Peroux, Daniele Sorini | &#160;&#160;The hot phase of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) allows us to probe the&#10;inflow and outflow of gas within a galaxy, which is responsible for dictating&#10;the evolution of the galaxy. Studying the hot CGM sheds light on a better&#10;understanding of gas physics, which is crucial to inform and constrain&#10;simulation models. With the recent advances in observational measurements&#10;probing the hot CGM in X&#45;rays and tSZ, we have a new avenue for widening our&#10;knowledge of gas physics and feedback by exploiting the information from&#10;current/future observations. In this paper, we use the TNG300 hydrodynamical&#10;simulations to build a fully self&#45;consistent forward model for the hot CGM. We&#10;construct a lightcone and generate mock X&#45;ray observations. We quantify the&#10;projection effects, namely the locally correlated large&#45;scale structure in&#10;X&#45;rays and the effect due to satellite galaxies misclassified as centrals which&#10;affects the measured hot CGM galactocentric profiles in stacking experiments.&#10;We present an analytical model that describes the intrinsic X&#45;ray surface&#10;brightness profile across the stellar and halo mass bins. The increasing&#10;stellar mass bins result in decreasing values of $beta$, the exponent&#10;quantifying the slope of the intrinsic galactocentric profiles. We carry&#10;forward the current state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art by also showing the impact of the locally&#10;correlated environment on the measured X&#45;ray surface brightness profiles. We&#10;also present, for the first time, the effect of misclassified centrals in&#10;stacking experiments for three stellar mass bins: $10^{10.5&#45;11} M_odot$,&#10;$10^{11&#45;11.2} M_odot$, and $10^{11.2&#45;11.5} M_odot$. We find that the&#10;contaminating effect of the misclassified centrals on the stacked profiles&#10;increases when the stellar mass decreases.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10397v1) |&#10;| MOST: MR reconstruction Optimization for multiple downStream Tasks via&#10; &#160;continual learning | Hwihun Jeong, Se Young Chun, Jongho Lee | &#160;&#160;Deep learning&#45;based Magnetic Resonance (MR) reconstruction methods have&#10;focused on generating high&#45;quality images but they often overlook the impact on&#10;downstream tasks (e.g., segmentation) that utilize the reconstructed images.&#10;Cascading separately trained reconstruction network and downstream task network&#10;has been shown to introduce performance degradation due to error propagation&#10;and domain gaps between training datasets. To mitigate this issue, downstream&#10;task&#45;oriented reconstruction optimization has been proposed for a single&#10;downstream task. Expanding this optimization to multi&#45;task scenarios is not&#10;straightforward. In this work, we extended this optimization to sequentially&#10;introduced multiple downstream tasks and demonstrated that a single MR&#10;reconstruction network can be optimized for multiple downstream tasks by&#10;deploying continual learning (MOST). MOST integrated techniques from&#10;replay&#45;based continual learning and image&#45;guided loss to overcome catastrophic&#10;forgetting. Comparative experiments demonstrated that MOST outperformed a&#10;reconstruction network without finetuning, a reconstruction network with&#10;na&quot;ive finetuning, and conventional continual learning methods. This&#10;advancement empowers the application of a single MR reconstruction network for&#10;multiple downstream tasks.

In particular, we analyse the task of&#10;textit{multicopy state teleportation}, where Alice has $k$ identical copies of&#10;an arbitrary unknown $d$&#45;dimensional qudit state $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to teleport&#10;a single copy of $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to Bob using a maximally entangled&#10;two&#45;qudit state shared between Alice and Bob without Bob&#39;s correction. Alice&#10;may perform a joint measurement on her half of the entangled state and the $k$&#10;copies of $vertpsi&#13;angle$. We prove that the maximal probability of success&#10;for teleporting the exact state $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to Bob is&#10;$p(d,k)=frac{k}{d(k&#45;1+d)}$ and present an explicit protocol to attain this&#10;performance. Then, by utilising $k$ copies of an arbitrary target state&#10;$vertpsi&#13;angle$, we show how the multicopy state teleportation protocol can&#10;be employed to enhance the success probability of storage and retrieval of&#10;quantum programs, which aims to universally retrieve the action of an arbitrary&#10;quantum channel that is stored in a state. Our proofs make use of group&#10;representation theory methods, which may find applications beyond the problems&#10;addressed in this work.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10393v1) |&#10;| TPFL: Tsetlin&#45;Personalized Federated Learning with Confidence&#45;Based&#10; &#160;Clustering | Rasoul Jafari Gohari, Laya Aliahmadipour, Ezat Valipour | &#160;&#160;The world of Machine Learning (ML) has witnessed rapid changes in terms of&#10;new models and ways to process users data. The majority of work that has been&#10;done is focused on Deep Learning (DL) based approaches. However, with the&#10;emergence of new algorithms such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm, there&#10;is growing interest in exploring alternative approaches that may offer unique&#10;advantages in certain domains or applications. One of these domains is&#10;Federated Learning (FL), in which users privacy is of utmost importance. Due to&#10;its novelty, FL has seen a surge in the incorporation of personalization&#10;techniques to enhance model accuracy while maintaining user privacy under&#10;personalized conditions. In this work, we propose a novel approach dubbed TPFL:&#10;Tsetlin&#45;Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into&#10;clusters based on their confidence towards a specific class. In this way,&#10;clustering can benefit from two key advantages. Firstly, clients share only&#10;what they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight&#10;aggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been&#10;enough during the training. This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are&#10;non&#45;Independent and Identically Distributed (non&#45;IID). Secondly, by sharing&#10;only weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially&#10;reduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication&#10;cost. The results of TPFL demonstrated the highest accuracy on three different&#10;datasets; namely MNIST, FashionMNIST and FEMNIST.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10392v1) |&#10;| Prompt&#45;and&#45;Transfer: Dynamic Class&#45;aware Enhancement for Few&#45;shot&#10; &#160;Segmentation | Hanbo Bi, Yingchao Feng, Wenhui Diao, Peijin Wang, Yongqiang Mao, Kun Fu, Hongqi Wang, Xian Sun | &#160;&#160;For more efficient generalization to unseen domains (classes), most Few&#45;shot&#10;Segmentation (FSS) would directly exploit pre&#45;trained encoders and only&#10;fine&#45;tune the decoder, especially in the current era of large models. However,&#10;such fixed feature encoders tend to be class&#45;agnostic, inevitably activating&#10;objects that are irrelevant to the target class. In contrast, humans can&#10;effortlessly focus on specific objects in the line of sight. This paper mimics&#10;the visual perception pattern of human beings and proposes a novel and powerful&#10;prompt&#45;driven scheme, called ``Prompt and Transfer&quot; (PAT), which constructs a&#10;dynamic class&#45;aware prompting paradigm to tune the encoder for focusing on the&#10;interested object (target class) in the current task. Three key points are&#10;elaborated to enhance the prompting: 1) Cross&#45;modal linguistic information is&#10;introduced to initialize prompts for each task. 2) Semantic Prompt Transfer&#10;(SPT) that precisely transfers the class&#45;specific semantics within the images&#10;to prompts. 3) Part Mask Generator (PMG) that works in conjunction with SPT to&#10;adaptively generate different but complementary part prompts for different&#10;individuals. Surprisingly, PAT achieves competitive performance on 4 different&#10;tasks including standard FSS, Cross&#45;domain FSS (e.g., CV, medical, and remote&#10;sensing domains), Weak&#45;label FSS, and Zero&#45;shot Segmentation, setting new&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;arts on 11 benchmarks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10389v1) |&#10;| Revising the Structure of Recurrent Neural Networks to Eliminate&#10; &#160;Numerical Derivatives in Forming Physics Informed Loss Terms with Respect to&#10; &#160;Time | Mahyar Jahani&#45;nasab, Mohamad Ali Bijarchi | &#160;&#160;Solving unsteady partial differential equations (PDEs) using recurrent neural&#10;networks (RNNs) typically requires numerical derivatives between each block of&#10;the RNN to form the physics informed loss function. However, this introduces&#10;the complexities of numerical derivatives into the training process of these&#10;models. In this study, we propose modifying the structure of the traditional&#10;RNN to enable the prediction of each block over a time interval, making it&#10;possible to calculate the derivative of the output with respect to time using&#10;the backpropagation algorithm. To achieve this, the time intervals of these&#10;blocks are overlapped, defining a mutual loss function between them.&#10;Additionally, the employment of conditional hidden states enables us to achieve&#10;a unique solution for each block. The forget factor is utilized to control the&#10;influence of the conditional hidden state on the prediction of the subsequent&#10;block. This new model, termed the Mutual Interval RNN (MI&#45;RNN), is applied to&#10;solve three different benchmarks: the Burgers equation, unsteady heat&#10;conduction in an irregular domain, and the Green vortex problem. Our results&#10;demonstrate that MI&#45;RNN can find the exact solution more accurately compared to&#10;existing RNN models. For instance, in the second problem, MI&#45;RNN achieved one&#10;order of magnitude less relative error compared to the RNN model with numerical&#10;derivatives.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10388v1) |&#10;| Sharp decay rate for eigenfunctions of perturbed periodic Schrödinger&#10; &#160;operators | Wencai Liu, Rodrigo Matos, John N.

Specifically, we consider operators&#10;of the form $H = &#45;Delta + V + v$, where $Delta$ is the discrete Laplacian,&#10;$V: mathbb{Z}^d &#13;ightarrow mathbb{R}$ is a periodic potential, and $v:&#10;mathbb{Z}^d &#13;ightarrow mathbb{C}$ represents a decaying impurity.

Key applications include the absence of embedded eigenvalues for&#10;operators with impurities decaying faster than any exponential function and the&#10;determination of sharp decay rates for eigenfunctions. Our findings extend&#10;previous works by providing precise decay conditions for impurities and&#10;analyzing different spectral regimes of $&#10;ambda$.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10387v1) |&#10;| Mamba&#45;ST: State Space Model for Efficient Style Transfer | Filippo Botti, Alex Ergasti, Leonardo Rossi, Tomaso Fontanini, Claudio Ferrari, Massimo Bertozzi, Andrea Prati | &#160;&#160;The goal of style transfer is, given a content image and a style source,&#10;generating a new image preserving the content but with the artistic&#10;representation of the style source. Most of the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art architectures&#10;use transformers or diffusion&#45;based models to perform this task, despite the&#10;heavy computational burden that they require. In particular, transformers use&#10;self&#45; and cross&#45;attention layers which have large memory footprint, while&#10;diffusion models require high inference time. To overcome the above, this paper&#10;explores a novel design of Mamba, an emergent State&#45;Space Model (SSM), called&#10;Mamba&#45;ST, to perform style transfer. To do so, we adapt Mamba linear equation&#10;to simulate the behavior of cross&#45;attention layers, which are able to combine&#10;two separate embeddings into a single output, but drastically reducing memory&#10;usage and time complexity. We modified the Mamba&#39;s inner equations so to accept&#10;inputs from, and combine, two separate data streams. To the best of our&#10;knowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt the equations of SSMs to a vision&#10;task like style transfer without requiring any other module like&#10;cross&#45;attention or custom normalization layers. An extensive set of experiments&#10;demonstrates the superiority and efficiency of our method in performing style&#10;transfer compared to transformers and diffusion models.

This module employs the Z4c formulation to solve the Einstein&#10;equations. We demonstrate its accuracy through a series of standard numerical&#10;relativity tests, including convergence of the gravitational waveform from&#10;binary black hole coalescence. Furthermore, we conduct scaling tests on OLCF&#10;Frontier and NERSC Perlmutter, where AthenaK exhibits excellent weak scaling&#10;efficiency of 80% on up to 65,536 AMD MI250X GPUs on Frontier (relative to 4&#10;GPUs) and strong scaling efficiencies of 84% and 77% on AMD MI250X and NVIDIA&#10;A100 GPUs on Frontier and Perlmutter respectively. Additionally, we observe a&#10;significant performance boost, with two orders of magnitude speedup ($gtrsim&#10;200times$) on a GPU compared to a single CPU core, affirming that AthenaK is&#10;well&#45;suited for exascale computing, thereby expanding the potential for&#10;breakthroughs in numerical relativity research.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10383v1) |&#10;| J&#45;UBIK: The JAX&#45;accelerated Universal Bayesian Imaging Kit | Vincent Eberle, Matteo Guardiani, Margret Westerkamp, Philipp Frank, Julian Rüstig, Julia Stadler, Torsten A. Enßlin | &#160;&#160;Many advances in astronomy and astrophysics originate from accurate images of&#10;the sky emission across multiple wavelengths. This often requires&#10;reconstructing spatially and spectrally correlated signals detected from&#10;multiple instruments. To facilitate the high&#45;fidelity imaging of these signals,&#10;we introduce the universal Bayesian imaging kit (UBIK). Specifically, we&#10;present J&#45;UBIK, a flexible and modular implementation leveraging the&#10;JAX&#45;accelerated NIFTy.re software as its backend. J&#45;UBIK streamlines the&#10;implementation of the key Bayesian inference components, providing for all the&#10;necessary steps of Bayesian imaging pipelines. First, it provides adaptable&#10;prior models for different sky realizations. Second, it includes likelihood&#10;models tailored to specific instruments. So far, the package includes three&#10;instruments: Chandra and eROSITA for X&#45;ray observations, and the James Webb&#10;Space Telescope (JWST) for the near&#45; and mid&#45;infrared. The aim is to expand&#10;this set in the future. Third, these models can be integrated with various&#10;inference and optimization schemes, such as maximum a posteriori estimation and&#10;variational inference. Explicit demos show how to integrate the individual&#10;modules into a full analysis pipeline.

Biswas, Sudin Ganguly, Chunlei Qu, Santanu K. Maiti | &#160;&#160;We present a comprehensive study on enhancing the thermoelectric (TE)&#10;performance of bilayer graphene (BLG) through irradiation with arbitrarily&#10;polarized light, focusing on $AA$&#45; and $AB$&#45;stacked configurations with zigzag&#10;edges. Utilizing a combination of tight&#45;binding theory and density functional&#10;theory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on&#10;electronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the&#10;electronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function,&#10;which significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the&#10;overall {it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT&#10;calculations reveal that $AB$&#45;stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal&#10;conductivity compared to $AA$&#45;stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic&#10;scattering and phonon group velocity. The combined analysis shows that FOM&#10;exceeds unity in both stacking types, with notable improvements near the&#10;irradiation&#45;induced gap. Additionally, we explore the dependence of FOM on the&#10;system dimensions and temperature, demonstrating that light&#45;irradiated BLG&#10;holds great promise for efficient thermoelectric energy conversion and waste&#10;heat recovery. Our results show favorable responses over a wide range of&#10;irradiation parameters. These findings provide crucial insights into optimizing&#10;BLG for advanced TE applications through light&#45;induced modifications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10380v1) |&#10;| Leveraging Joint Spectral and Spatial Learning with MAMBA for&#10; &#160;Multichannel Speech Enhancement | Wenze Ren, Haibin Wu, Yi&#45;Cheng Lin, Xuanjun Chen, Rong Chao, Kuo&#45;Hsuan Hung, You&#45;Jin Li, Wen&#45;Yuan Ting, Hsin&#45;Min Wang, Yu Tsao | &#160;&#160;In multichannel speech enhancement, effectively capturing spatial and&#10;spectral information across different microphones is crucial for noise&#10;reduction. Traditional methods, such as CNN or LSTM, attempt to model the&#10;temporal dynamics of full&#45;band and sub&#45;band spectral and spatial features.&#10;However, these approaches face limitations in fully modeling complex temporal&#10;dependencies, especially in dynamic acoustic environments. To overcome these&#10;challenges, we modify the current advanced model McNet by introducing an&#10;improved version of Mamba, a state&#45;space model, and further propose MCMamba.&#10;MCMamba has been completely reengineered to integrate full&#45;band and narrow&#45;band&#10;spatial information with sub&#45;band and full&#45;band spectral features, providing a&#10;more comprehensive approach to modeling spatial and spectral information.

This study introduces&#10;a novel statistical approach, TAR4C, to dissect causal interactions in&#10;multichannel EEG recordings. TAR4C uses the threshold autoregressive model to&#10;describe the causal interaction between nodes or clusters of nodes in a brain&#10;network. The perspective involves testing whether one node, which may represent&#10;a brain region, can control the dynamics of the other. The node that has such&#10;an impact on the other is called a threshold variable and can be classified as&#10;a causative because its functionality is the leading source operating as an&#10;instantaneous switching mechanism that regulates the time&#45;varying&#10;autoregressive structure of the other. This statistical concept is commonly&#10;referred to as threshold non&#45;linearity. Once threshold non&#45;linearity has been&#10;verified between a pair of nodes, the subsequent essential facet of TAR&#10;modeling is to assess the predictive ability of the causal node for the current&#10;activity on the other and represent causal interactions in autoregressive&#10;terms. This predictive ability is what underlies Granger causality. The TAR4C&#10;approach can discover non&#45;linear and time&#45;dependent causal interactions without&#10;negating the G&#45;causality perspective. The efficacy of the proposed approach is&#10;exemplified by analyzing the EEG signals recorded during the motor&#10;movement/imagery experiment. The similarities and differences between the&#10;causal interactions manifesting during the execution and the imagery of a given&#10;motor movement are demonstrated by analyzing EEG recordings from multiple&#10;subjects.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10374v1) |&#10;| Instigating Cooperation among LLM Agents Using Adaptive Information&#10; &#160;Modulation | Qiliang Chen, &#160;Alireza, &#160;Ilami, Nunzio Lore, Babak Heydari | &#160;&#160;This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for&#10;human strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these&#10;agents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments. Our&#10;approach extends traditional agent&#45;based simulations by using strategic LLM&#10;agents (SLA) and introducing dynamic and adaptive governance through a&#10;pro&#45;social promoting RL agent (PPA) that modulates information access across&#10;agents in a network, optimizing social welfare and promoting pro&#45;social&#10;behavior. Through validation in iterative games, including the prisoner&#10;dilemma, we demonstrate that SLA agents exhibit nuanced strategic adaptations.&#10;The PPA agent effectively learns to adjust information transparency, resulting&#10;in enhanced cooperation rates. This framework offers significant insights into&#10;AI&#45;mediated social dynamics, contributing to the deployment of AI in real&#45;world&#10;team settings.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10372v1) |&#10;| Learning Gentle Grasping from Human&#45;Free Force Control Demonstration | Mingxuan Li, Lunwei Zhang, Tiemin Li, Yao Jiang | &#160;&#160;Humans can steadily and gently grasp unfamiliar objects based on tactile&#10;perception. Robots still face challenges in achieving similar performance due&#10;to the difficulty of learning accurate grasp&#45;force predictions and force&#10;control strategies that can be generalized from limited data. In this article,&#10;we propose an approach for learning grasping from ideal force control&#10;demonstrations, to achieve similar performance of human hands with limited data&#10;size. Our approach utilizes objects with known contact characteristics to&#10;automatically generate reference force curves without human demonstrations. In&#10;addition, we design the dual convolutional neural networks (Dual&#45;CNN)&#10;architecture which incorporating a physics&#45;based mechanics module for learning&#10;target grasping force predictions from demonstrations. The described method can&#10;be effectively applied in vision&#45;based tactile sensors and enables gentle and&#10;stable grasping of objects from the ground. The described prediction model and&#10;grasping strategy were validated in offline evaluations and online experiments,&#10;and the accuracy and generalizability were demonstrated.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10371v1) |&#10;| Uncovering the Mechanism of Hepatotoxiciy of PFAS Targeting L&#45;FABP Using&#10; &#160;GCN and Computational Modeling | Lucas Jividen, Tibo Duran, Xi&#45;Zhi Niu, Jun Bai | &#160;&#160;Per&#45; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental&#10;pollutants with known toxicity and bioaccumulation issues. Their widespread&#10;industrial use and resistance to degradation have led to global environmental&#10;contamination and significant health concerns. While a minority of PFAS have&#10;been extensively studied, the toxicity of many PFAS remains poorly understood&#10;due to limited direct toxicological data. This study advances the predictive&#10;modeling of PFAS toxicity by combining semi&#45;supervised graph convolutional&#10;networks (GCNs) with molecular descriptors and fingerprints. We propose a novel&#10;approach to enhance the prediction of PFAS binding affinities by isolating&#10;molecular fingerprints to construct graphs where then descriptors are set as&#10;the node features. This approach specifically captures the structural,&#10;physicochemical, and topological features of PFAS without overfitting due to an&#10;abundance of features. Unsupervised clustering then identifies representative&#10;compounds for detailed binding studies. Our results provide a more accurate&#10;ability to estimate PFAS hepatotoxicity to provide guidance in chemical&#10;discovery of new PFAS and the development of new safety regulations.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10370v1) |&#10;| Stochastic Control of UAVs: An Optimal Tradeoff between Performance,&#10; &#160;Flight Smoothness and Control Effort | George Rapakoulias, Panagiotis Tsiotras | &#160;&#160;Safe and accurate control of unmanned aerial vehicles in the presence of&#10;winds is a challenging control problem due to the hard&#45;to&#45;model and highly&#10;stochastic nature of the disturbance forces acting upon the vehicle. To meet&#10;performance constraints, state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art control methods such as Incremental&#10;Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) or other adaptive control techniques require&#10;high control gains to mitigate the effects of uncertainty entering the system.&#10;While achieving good tracking performance, IDNI requires excessive control&#10;effort, results in high actuator strain, and reduced flight smoothness due to&#10;constant and aggressive corrective actions commanded by the controller. In this&#10;paper, we propose a novel control architecture that allows the user to&#10;systematically address the trade&#45;off between high authority control and&#10;performance constraint satisfaction. Our approach consists of two parts. To&#10;cancel out biases introduced by unmodelled aerodynamic effects we propose a&#10;hybrid, model&#45;based disturbance force estimator augmented with a neural&#10;network, that can adapt to external wind conditions using a Kalman Filter. We&#10;then utilize state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art results from Covariance Steering theory, which&#10;offers a principled way of controlling the uncertainty of the tracking error&#10;dynamics. We first analyze the properties of the combined system and then&#10;provide extensive experimental results to verify the advantages of the proposed&#10;approach over existing methods&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10369v1) |&#10;| Integrated nowcasting of convective precipitation with Transformer&#45;based&#10; &#160;models using multi&#45;source data | Çağlar Küçük, Aitor Atencia, Markus Dabernig | &#160;&#160;Precipitation nowcasting is crucial for mitigating the impacts of severe&#10;weather events and supporting daily activities. Conventional models&#10;predominantly relying on radar data have limited performance in predicting&#10;cases with complex temporal features such as convection initiation,&#10;highlighting the need to integrate data from other sources for more&#10;comprehensive nowcasting. Unlike physics&#45;based models, machine learning&#10;(ML)&#45;based models offer promising solutions for efficiently integrating large&#10;volumes of diverse data. We present EF4INCA, a spatiotemporal Transformer model&#10;for precipitation nowcasting that integrates satellite&#45; and ground&#45;based&#10;observations with numerical weather prediction outputs. EF4INCA provides&#10;high&#45;resolution forecasts over Austria, accurately predicting the location and&#10;shape of precipitation fields with a spatial resolution of 1 kilometre and a&#10;temporal resolution of 5 minutes, up to 90 minutes ahead. Our evaluation shows&#10;that EF4INCA outperforms conventional nowcasting models, including the&#10;operational model of Austria, particularly in scenarios with complex temporal&#10;features such as convective initiation and rapid weather changes. EF4INCA&#10;maintains higher accuracy in location forecasting but generates smoother fields&#10;at later prediction times compared to traditional models. Interpretation of our&#10;model showed that precipitation products and SEVIRI infrared channels CH7 and&#10;CH9 are the most important data streams. These results underscore the&#10;importance of combining data from different domains, including physics&#45;based&#10;model products, with ML approaches. Our study highlights the robustness of&#10;EF4INCA and its potential for improved precipitation nowcasting. We provide&#10;access to our code repository, model weights, and the dataset curated for&#10;benchmarking, facilitating further development and application.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10367v1) |&#10;&#10;">

Hill, Matthias Kluge, Martin Landriau, Ximena Mazzalay, Eva Noyola, Taniya Parikh, Jan Snigula | &#160;&#160;We analyse the stellar structure of a sample of dwarf ellipticals (dE)&#10;inhabiting various environments within the Virgo cluster. Integral&#45;field&#10;observations with a high spectral resolution allow us to robustly determine&#10;their low velocity dispersions ($sim25$ km s$^{&#45;1}$) and higher&#45;order&#10;kinematic moments out to the half&#45;light radius. We find the dEs exhibit a&#10;diversity in ages with the younger dEs being less enhanced than the older,&#10;suggesting a complex star formation history for those dEs that recently entered&#10;Virgo while others have been quenched shortly after reionization.&#10;Orbit&#45;superposition modeling allowed us to recover viewing angles, stellar&#10;mass&#45;to&#45;light ratios (with gradients), as well as the intrinsic orbit&#10;structure. We find that the angular momentum of the dEs is strongly suppressed&#10;compared to ordinary early&#45;type galaxies and correlates with the environment.&#10;Flattened dEs are so because of a suppressed kinetic energy perpendicular to&#10;their equatorial plane. Combining population and dynamical modeling results, we&#10;find an age&#45;dependent stellar initial mass function (IMF) or, alternatively,&#10;evidence for a more extended star formation history for those galaxies that&#10;have had higher initial mass and/or inhabited lower density environments. dEs&#10;appear to have a spatially homogeneous stellar structure but the state they&#10;were `frozen&#39; in as they stopped forming stars varies dramatically according to&#10;their initial conditions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10518v1) |&#10;| RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long&#45;Context LLM Inference via Vector&#10; &#160;Retrieval | Di Liu, Meng Chen, Baotong Lu, Huiqiang Jiang, Zhenhua Han, Qianxi Zhang, Qi Chen, Chengruidong Zhang, Bailu Ding, Kai Zhang, Chen Chen, Fan Yang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu | &#160;&#160;Transformer&#45;based large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly important&#10;in various domains. However, the quadratic time complexity of attention&#10;operation poses a significant challenge for scaling to longer contexts due to&#10;the extremely high inference latency and GPU memory consumption for caching&#10;key&#45;value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training&#45;free&#10;approach to accelerate attention computation. To leverage the dynamic sparse&#10;property of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor&#10;search (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most&#10;relevant ones via vector search during generation. Due to the&#10;out&#45;of&#45;distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors, off&#45;the&#45;shelf&#10;ANNS indexes still need to scan O(N) (usually 30% of all keys) data for&#10;accurate retrieval, which fails to exploit the high sparsity.&#10;RetrievalAttention first identifies the OOD challenge of ANNS&#45;based attention,&#10;and addresses it via an attention&#45;aware vector search algorithm that can adapt&#10;to queries and only access 1&#45;&#45;3% of data, thus achieving a sub&#45;linear time&#10;complexity. RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of&#10;long&#45;context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the&#10;model accuracy. Especially, RetrievalAttention only needs 16GB GPU memory for&#10;serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating&#10;one token in 0.188 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB).&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516v1) |&#10;| An Efficient Self&#45;Learning Framework For Interactive Spoken Dialog&#10; &#160;Systems | Hitesh Tulsiani, David M. Chan, Shalini Ghosh, Garima Lalwani, Prabhat Pandey, Ankish Bansal, Sri Garimella, Ariya Rastrow, Björn Hoffmeister | &#160;&#160;Dialog systems, such as voice assistants, are expected to engage with users&#10;in complex, evolving conversations. Unfortunately, traditional automatic speech&#10;recognition (ASR) systems deployed in such applications are usually trained to&#10;recognize each turn independently and lack the ability to adapt to the&#10;conversational context or incorporate user feedback. In this work, we introduce&#10;a general framework for ASR in dialog systems that can go beyond learning from&#10;single&#45;turn utterances and learn over time how to adapt to both explicit&#10;supervision and implicit user feedback present in multi&#45;turn conversations. We&#10;accomplish that by leveraging advances in student&#45;teacher learning and&#10;context&#45;aware dialog processing, and designing contrastive self&#45;supervision&#10;approaches with Ohm, a new online hard&#45;negative mining approach. We show that&#10;leveraging our new framework compared to traditional training leads to relative&#10;WER reductions of close to 10% in real&#45;world dialog systems, and up to 26% on&#10;public synthetic data.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10515v1) |&#10;| Constraints on axions from patchy screening of the cosmic microwave&#10; &#160;background | Samuel Goldstein, Fiona McCarthy, Cristina Mondino, J. Colin Hill, Junwu Huang, Matthew C. Johnson | &#160;&#160;The resonant conversion of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons into&#10;axions within large&#45;scale structure induces an anisotropic spectral distortion&#10;in CMB temperature maps. Applying state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art foreground cleaning&#10;techniques to $textit{Planck}$ CMB observations, we construct maps of&#10;axion&#45;induced &quot;patchy screening&quot; of the CMB. We cross&#45;correlate these maps with&#10;data from the $textit{unWISE}$ galaxy survey and find no evidence of axions.&#10;We constrain the axion&#45;photon coupling, $g_{agammagamma} &#10;esssim 2 times&#10;10^{&#45;12}~{&#13;m GeV}^{&#45;1}$, at the 95% confidence level for axion masses in the&#10;range $10^{&#45;13}~{&#13;m eV} &#10;esssim m_a &#10;esssim 10^{&#45;12}~{&#13;m eV}$. These&#10;constraints are competitive with the tightest astrophysical axion limits in&#10;this mass range and are inferred from robust population&#45;level statistics, which&#10;makes them complementary to existing searches that rely on modeling of&#10;individual systems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10514v1) |&#10;| Weak Superimposed Codes of Improved Asymptotic Rate and Their Randomized&#10; &#160;Construction | Yu Tsunoda, Yuichiro Fujiwara | &#160;&#160;Weak superimposed codes are combinatorial structures related closely to&#10;generalized cover&#45;free families, superimposed codes, and disjunct matrices in&#10;that they are only required to satisfy similar but less stringent conditions.&#10;This class of codes may also be seen as a stricter variant of what are known as&#10;locally thin families in combinatorics. Originally, weak superimposed codes&#10;were introduced in the context of multimedia content protection against illegal&#10;distribution of copies under the assumption that a coalition of malicious users&#10;may employ the averaging attack with adversarial noise. As in many other kinds&#10;of codes in information theory, it is of interest and importance in the study&#10;of weak superimposed codes to find the highest achievable rate in the&#10;asymptotic regime and give an efficient construction that produces an infinite&#10;sequence of codes that achieve it. Here, we prove a tighter lower bound than&#10;the sharpest known one on the rate of optimal weak superimposed codes and give&#10;a polynomial&#45;time randomized construction algorithm for codes that&#10;asymptotically attain our improved bound with high probability. Our&#10;probabilistic approach is versatile and applicable to many other related codes&#10;and arrays.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10511v1) |&#10;| Pennsieve &#45; A Collaborative Platform for Translational Neuroscience and&#10; &#160;Beyond | Zack Goldblum, Zhongchuan Xu, Haoer Shi, Patryk Orzechowski, Jamaal Spence, Kathryn A Davis, Brian Litt, Nishant Sinha, Joost Wagenaar | &#160;&#160;The exponential growth of neuroscientific data necessitates platforms that&#10;facilitate data management and multidisciplinary collaboration.

Our results demonstrate&#10;that resistivity can significantly influence the development of&#10;magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, resulting in markedly different magnetic&#10;field geometries. Additionally, resistivity suppresses the growth of these&#10;instabilities, leading to a reduction in the amplitude of emitted gravitational&#10;waves.

We propose an LLM&#45;based translation&#10;scheme that improves the success rate of translating large&#45;scale C code into&#10;compilable Rust code. Our approach involves three key techniques: (1)&#10;pre&#45;processing the C code to better align its structure and expressions with&#10;Rust, (2) segmenting the code into optimally sized translation units to avoid&#10;exceeding the LLM&#39;s context window limits, and (3) iteratively compiling and&#10;repairing errors while maintaining consistency between translation units using&#10;context&#45;supplementing prompts. Compilation success is an essential first step&#10;in achieving functional equivalence, as only compilable code can be further&#10;tested. In experiments with 20 benchmark C programs, including those exceeding&#10;4 kilo lines of code, we successfully translated all programs into compilable&#10;Rust code without losing corresponding parts of the original code.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10506v1) |&#10;| Machine Learning Optimization of non&#45;Kasha Behavior and of Transient&#10; &#160;Dynamics in Model Retinal Isomerization | Davinder Singh, Chern Chuang, Paul Brumer | &#160;&#160;Designing a model of retinal isomerization in Rhodopsin, the first step in&#10;vision, that accounts for both experimental transient and stationary state&#10;observables is challenging.

With an appropriate&#10;selection of objectives, the optimized retinal model predicts excitation&#10;wavelength&#45;dependent fluorescence spectra that closely align with&#10;experimentally observed non&#45;Kasha behavior in the non&#45;equilibrium steady state.&#10;Further, adjustments to the potential energy surface within the TM model reduce&#10;the discrepancies across the time domain.

Existing works often rely&#10;on local interpretability methods, failing to provide comprehensive&#10;explanations of the overall mechanism behind each label prediction within a&#10;multilabel set. We propose a mechanistic interpretability module called&#10;DIctionary Label Attention (method) that disentangles uninterpretable dense&#10;embeddings into a sparse embedding space, where each nonzero element (a&#10;dictionary feature) represents a globally learned medical concept. Through&#10;human evaluations, we show that our sparse embeddings are more human&#10;understandable than its dense counterparts by at least 50 percent. Our&#10;automated dictionary feature identification pipeline, leveraging large language&#10;models (LLMs), uncovers thousands of learned medical concepts by examining and&#10;summarizing the highest activating tokens for each dictionary feature. We&#10;represent the relationships between dictionary features and medical codes&#10;through a sparse interpretable matrix, enhancing the mechanistic and global&#10;understanding of the model&#39;s predictions while maintaining competitive&#10;performance and scalability without extensive human annotation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10504v1) |&#10;| Causal Language Modeling Can Elicit Search and Reasoning Capabilities on&#10; &#160;Logic Puzzles | Kulin Shah, Nishanth Dikkala, Xin Wang, Rina Panigrahy | &#160;&#160;Causal language modeling using the Transformer architecture has yielded&#10;remarkable capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) over the last few&#10;years. However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning&#10;capabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this&#10;work, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as&#10;solving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to&#10;search over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then&#10;apply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the&#10;application of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in&#10;a cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases,&#10;multiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We&#10;observe that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn&#10;to solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21%$ of the puzzles fully correctly)&#10;when trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that&#10;training Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and&#10;without such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis&#10;to Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves&#10;$92.04 %$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal&#10;representations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear&#10;probing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any&#10;given cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine&#10;implicit in the Transformer weights.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10502v1) |&#10;| Alignment with nonlinear velocity couplings: collision&#45;avoidance and&#10; &#160;micro&#45;to&#45;macro mean&#45;field limits | Young&#45;Pil Choi, Michał Fabisiak, Jan Peszek | &#160;&#160;We investigate the pressureless fractional Euler&#45;alignment system with&#10;nonlinear velocity couplings, referred to as the $p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system.&#10;This model features a nonlinear velocity alignment force, interpreted as a&#10;density&#45;weighted fractional $p$&#45;Laplacian when the singularity parameter&#10;$alpha$ exceeds the spatial dimension $d$. Our primary goal is to establish&#10;the existence of solutions for strongly singular interactions ($alpha ge d$)&#10;and compactly supported initial conditions. We construct solutions as&#10;mean&#45;field limits of empirical measures from a kinetic variant of the&#10;$p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system. Specifically, we show that a sequence of empirical&#10;measures converges to a finite Radon measure, whose local density and velocity&#10;satisfy the $p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system. Our results are the first to prove the&#10;existence of solutions to this system in multi&#45;dimensional settings without&#10;significant initial data restrictions, covering both nonlinear ($p&gt;2$) and&#10;linear ($p=2$) cases. Additionally, we establish global existence, uniqueness,&#10;and collision avoidance for the corresponding particle ODE system under&#10;non&#45;collisional initial conditions, extending previous results for $1 &#10;e p &#10;e&#10;alpha + 2$. This analysis supports our mean&#45;field limit argument and&#10;contributes to understanding alignment models with singular communication.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10501v1) |&#10;| Focus diverse phase retrieval test results on broadband continuous&#10; &#160;wavefront sensing in space telescope applications | Hyukmo Kang, Kyle Van Gorkom, Meghdoot Biswas, Daewook Kim, Ewan S. Douglas | &#160;&#160;Continuous wavefront sensing benefits space observatories in on&#45;orbit optical&#10;performance maintenance. To measure the phase of a wavefront, phase retrieval&#10;is an attractive technique as it uses multiple point spread function (PSF)&#10;images that are acquired by the telescope itself without extra metrology&#10;systems nor complicated calibration. The focus diverse phase retrieval utilizes&#10;PSFs from predetermined defocused positions to enhance the dynamic range of the&#10;algorithm. We describe an updated visible light active optics testbed with the&#10;addition of a linear motorized focus stage. The performance of the phase&#10;retrieval algorithm in broadband is tested under various cases. While broadband&#10;pass filters have advantages in higher signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio (SNR), the&#10;performance of phase retrieval can be restricted due to blurred image caused by&#10;diffraction and increased computing cost. We used multiple bandpass filters (10&#10;nm, 88 nm, and 150 nm) and investigated effects of bandwidth on the accuracy&#10;and required image acquisition conditions such as SNR, reaching accuracies&#10;below 20 nm RMS wavefront error at the widest bandwidth. We also investigated&#10;the dynamic range of the phase retrieval algorithm depending on the bandwidth&#10;and required amount of defocus to expand dynamic range. Finally, we simulated&#10;the continuous wavefront sensing and correction loop with a range of&#10;statistically generated representative telescope disturbance time series to&#10;test for edge cases.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10500v1) |&#10;| The role of higher&#45;order terms in trapped&#45;ion quantum computing with&#10; &#160;magnetic gradient induced coupling | Sebastian Nagies, Kevin T. Geier, Javed Akram, Junichi Okamoto, Dimitris Badounas, Christof Wunderlich, Michael Johanning, Philipp Hauke | &#160;&#160;Trapped&#45;ion hardware based on the Magnetic Gradient Induced Coupling (MAGIC)&#10;scheme is emerging as a promising platform for quantum computing. Nevertheless,&#10;in this (as in any other) quantum&#45;computing platform, many technical questions&#10;still have to be resolved before large&#45;scale and error&#45;tolerant applications&#10;are possible. In this work, we present a thorough discussion of the&#10;contribution of higher&#45;order terms to the MAGIC setup, which can occur due to&#10;anharmonicities in the external potential of the ion crystal (e.g., through&#10;Coulomb repulsion) or through curvature of the applied magnetic field. These&#10;terms take the form of three&#45;spin couplings as well as diverse terms that&#10;couple spins to phonons. We find that most of these are negligible in realistic&#10;situations, with only two contributions that need careful attention. First,&#10;there are parasitic longitudinal fields whose strength increases with chain&#10;length, but which can easily be compensated by a microwave detuning. Second,&#10;anharmonicities of the Coulomb interaction can lead to well&#45;known two&#45;to&#45;one&#10;conversions of phonon excitations, which can be avoided if the phonons are&#10;ground&#45;state cooled. Our detailed analysis constitutes an important&#10;contribution on the way of making magnetic&#45;gradient trapped&#45;ion quantum&#10;technology fit for large&#45;scale applications, and it may inspire new ways to&#10;purposefully design interaction terms.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10498v1) |&#10;| MusicLIME: Explainable Multimodal Music Understanding | Theodoros Sotirou, Vassilis Lyberatos, Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Stamou | &#160;&#160;Multimodal models are critical for music understanding tasks, as they capture&#10;the complex interplay between audio and lyrics. However, as these models become&#10;more prevalent, the need for explainability grows&#45;understanding how these&#10;systems make decisions is vital for ensuring fairness, reducing bias, and&#10;fostering trust. In this paper, we introduce MusicLIME, a model&#45;agnostic&#10;feature importance explanation method designed for multimodal music models.&#10;Unlike traditional unimodal methods, which analyze each modality separately&#10;without considering the interaction between them, often leading to incomplete&#10;or misleading explanations, MusicLIME reveals how audio and lyrical features&#10;interact and contribute to predictions, providing a holistic view of the&#10;model&#39;s decision&#45;making. Additionally, we enhance local explanations by&#10;aggregating them into global explanations, giving users a broader perspective&#10;of model behavior. Through this work, we contribute to improving the&#10;interpretability of multimodal music models, empowering users to make informed&#10;choices, and fostering more equitable, fair, and transparent music&#10;understanding systems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10496v1) |&#10;| Incorporating Classifier&#45;Free Guidance in Diffusion Model&#45;Based&#10; &#160;Recommendation | Noah Buchanan, Susan Gauch, Quan Mai | &#160;&#160;This paper presents a diffusion&#45;based recommender system that incorporates&#10;classifier&#45;free guidance. Most current recommender systems provide&#10;recommendations using conventional methods such as collaborative or&#10;content&#45;based filtering. Diffusion is a new approach to generative AI that&#10;improves on previous generative AI approaches such as Variational Autoencoders&#10;(VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We incorporate diffusion in&#10;a recommender system that mirrors the sequence users take when browsing and&#10;rating items. Although a few current recommender systems incorporate diffusion,&#10;they do not incorporate classifier&#45;free guidance, a new innovation in diffusion&#10;models as a whole. In this paper, we present a diffusion recommender system&#10;that augments the underlying recommender system model for improved performance&#10;and also incorporates classifier&#45;free guidance. Our findings show improvements&#10;over state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art recommender systems for most metrics for several&#10;recommendation tasks on a variety of datasets. In particular, our approach&#10;demonstrates the potential to provide better recommendations when data is&#10;sparse.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10494v1) |&#10;| Renormalization of the Einstein&#45;Cartan Theory in First&#45;Order Form | F. T. Brandt, J. Frenkel, S. Martins&#45;Filho, D. G. C. McKeon | &#160;&#160;We examine the Einstein&#45;Cartan (EC) theory in first&#45;order form, which has a&#10;diffeomorphism as well as a local Lorentz invariance. We study the&#10;renormalizability of this theory in the framework of the Batalin&#45;Vilkovisky&#10;formalism, which allows for a gauge invariant renormalization. Using the&#10;background field method, we discuss the gauge invariance of the background&#10;effective action and analyze the Ward identities which reflect the symmetries&#10;of the EC theory. As an application, we compute, in a general background gauge,&#10;the self&#45;energy of the tetrad field at one&#45;loop order.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10493v1) |&#10;| What we can learn from the angular differential rates (only) in&#10; &#160;semileptonic $B to D^* ell ν_ell$ decays | G. Martinelli, S. Simula, L.

Our approach is model independent and never requires the&#10;knowledge of $vert V_{cb}vert$. By studying such distributions in the case of&#10;light leptons, a comparison between results from different data sets from the&#10;Belle and BelleII Collaborations and between data and Standard Model&#10;calculations is also given for several interesting quantities. A good&#10;consistency is observed between some of the experimental results and the&#10;theoretical predictions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10492v1) |&#10;| Code Vulnerability Detection: A Comparative Analysis of Emerging Large&#10; &#160;Language Models | Shaznin Sultana, Sadia Afreen, Nasir U. Eisty | &#160;&#160;The growing trend of vulnerability issues in software development as a result&#10;of a large dependence on open&#45;source projects has received considerable&#10;attention recently. This paper investigates the effectiveness of Large Language&#10;Models (LLMs) in identifying vulnerabilities within codebases, with a focus on&#10;the latest advancements in LLM technology. Through a comparative analysis, we&#10;assess the performance of emerging LLMs, specifically Llama, CodeLlama, Gemma,&#10;and CodeGemma, alongside established state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art models such as BERT,&#10;RoBERTa, and GPT&#45;3. Our study aims to shed light on the capabilities of LLMs in&#10;vulnerability detection, contributing to the enhancement of software security&#10;practices across diverse open&#45;source repositories. We observe that CodeGemma&#10;achieves the highest F1&#45;score of 58 and a Recall of 87, amongst the recent&#10;additions of large language models to detect software security vulnerabilities.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10490v1) |&#10;| Flash STU: Fast Spectral Transform Units | Y.

Our paper aims to investigate if VLMs&#10;pre&#45;trained on web&#45;scale data learn to encode object states, which can be&#10;extracted with zero&#45;shot text prompts. We curate an object state recognition&#10;dataset ChangeIt&#45;Frames, and evaluate nine open&#45;source VLMs, including models&#10;trained with contrastive and generative objectives. We observe that while these&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art vision&#45;language models can reliably perform object&#10;recognition, they consistently fail to accurately distinguish the objects&#39;&#10;physical states. Through extensive experiments, we identify three areas for&#10;improvements for VLMs to better encode object states, namely the quality of&#10;object localization, the architecture to bind concepts to objects, and the&#10;objective to learn discriminative visual and language encoders on object&#10;states.

Ruan, Michael Eracleous, Daryl Haggard, Jessie C. Runnoe | &#160;&#160;The physical processes that produce X&#45;ray Quasi&#45;Periodic Eruptions (QPEs)&#10;recently discovered from the nuclei of several low&#45;redshift galaxies are&#10;mysterious. Several pieces of observational evidence strongly suggest a link&#10;between QPEs and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE). Previous studies also reveal&#10;that the morphologies of TDE host galaxies are highly concentrated, with high&#10;Sersic indicies, bulge&#45;to&#45;total light (B/T) ratios, and stellar surface mass&#10;densities relative to the broader galaxy population. We use these distinctive&#10;properties to test the link between QPEs and TDEs, by comparing these&#10;parameters of QPE host galaxies to TDE host galaxies. We employ archival Legacy&#10;Survey images of a sample of 9 QPE host galaxies and a sample of 13 TDE host&#10;galaxies, and model their surface brightness profiles. We show that QPE host&#10;galaxies have high Sersic indices of ~3, high B/T ratios of ~0.5, and high&#10;surface mass densities of ~10^10 Msun kpc^&#45;2. These properties are similar to&#10;TDE host galaxies, but are in strong contrast to a mass&#45; and redshift&#45;matched&#10;control sample of galaxies. We also find tentative evidence that the central&#10;black holes in both QPE and TDE host galaxies are undermassive relative to&#10;their stellar mass. The morphological similarities between QPE and TDE host&#10;galaxies at the population level add to the mounting evidence of a physical&#10;link between these phenomena, and favor QPE models that also invoke TDEs.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10486v1) |&#10;| Tuning the Rate of Tightly Packed Systems To Produce Planet Occurrence&#10; &#160;Trends with Galactic Height | Sarah Ballard | &#160;&#160;The formation of planetary systems has historically been considered in&#10;isolation, decoupled from processes on galactic scales. Recent findings&#10;employing data from ESA&#39;s Gaia mission challenge this narrative, identifying&#10;trends in planet occurrence with galactic kinematics and stellar age. The&#10;findings indicate changes in planet occurrence over and above the predicted&#10;changes from metallicity variation within the Milky Way, so that changes to&#10;stellar metallicity alone (long understood to be deterministic in planet&#10;outcomes) cannot explain the trends entirely. The scope of potential factors&#10;influencing planet formation has grown progressively wider, with accompanying&#10;theoretical support for galactic&#45;scale influences upon planet formation. In&#10;this manuscript, we investigate specifically how changes to the rate of Systems&#10;of Tightly&#45;packed Inner Planets (STIPs) could manifest as a trend in planet&#10;occurrence with galactic height. We focus our study upon M dwarf planetary&#10;systems for two reasons: first, they host STIPs at high rates, and secondly,&#10;their longevity makes them useful probes for kinematic trends over Gyr. We&#10;consider two models for a varying STIP rate: one in which STIP likelihood is&#10;determined by stellar age alone, irrespective of galactic time, and another in&#10;which the STIP likelihood suddenly increased in recent galactic history. Both&#10;models, which impose a higher STIP likelihood among younger stars, produce a&#10;negative gradient in planet occurrence with increasing height from the galactic&#10;midplane. We find that a step function model in which STIP likelihood increased&#10;by a factor of several ~a few Gyr ago resembles an observed trend among FGK&#10;dwarfs. We consider plausible physical mechanisms that could mimic the&#10;hypothesized model, given known links between STIP occurrence and other stellar&#10;and planetary properties.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10485v1) |&#10;| XLM for Autonomous Driving Systems: A Comprehensive Review | Sonda Fourati, Wael Jaafar, Noura Baccar, Safwan Alfattani | &#160;&#160;Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable proficiency in various&#10;information&#45;processing tasks. These tasks span from extracting data and&#10;summarizing literature to generating content, predictive modeling,&#10;decision&#45;making, and system controls. Moreover, Vision Large Models (VLMs) and&#10;Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which represent the next generation of language&#10;models, a.k.a., XLMs, can combine and integrate many data modalities with the&#10;strength of language understanding, thus advancing several information&#45;based&#10;systems, such as Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). Indeed, by combining&#10;language communication with multimodal sensory inputs, e.g., panoramic images&#10;and LiDAR or radar data, accurate driving actions can be taken. In this&#10;context, we provide in this survey paper a comprehensive overview of the&#10;potential of XLMs towards achieving autonomous driving. Specifically, we review&#10;the relevant literature on ADS and XLMs, including their architectures, tools,&#10;and frameworks. Then, we detail the proposed approaches to deploy XLMs for&#10;autonomous driving solutions. Finally, we provide the related challenges to XLM&#10;deployment for ADS and point to future research directions aiming to enable XLM&#10;adoption in future ADS frameworks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10484v1) |&#10;| Efficient polarizable QM/MM using the direct reaction field Hamiltonian&#10; &#160;with electrostatic potential fitted multipole operators | Thomas P. Fay, Nicolas Ferré, Miquel Huix&#45;Rotllant | &#160;&#160;Electronic polarization and dispersion are decisive actors in determining&#10;interaction energies between molecules. These interactions have a particularly&#10;profound effect on excitation energies of molecules in complex environments,&#10;especially when the excitation involves a significant degree of charge&#10;reorganisation. The direct reaction field (DRF) approach, which has seen a&#10;recent revival of interest, provides a powerful framework for describing these&#10;interactions in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models of&#10;systems, where a small subsystem of interest is described using quantum&#10;chemical methods and the remainder is treated with a simple MM force field. In&#10;this paper we show how the DRF approach can be combined with the electrostatic&#10;potential fitted (ESPF) multipole operator description of the QM region charge&#10;density, which reduces the scaling $mathcal{O}(N_mathrm{MM}^3)$ of the method&#10;with MM system to $mathcal{O}(N_mathrm{MM}^2)$. We also show how the DRF&#10;approach can be combined with fluctuating charge descriptions of the&#10;polarizable environment, as well as previously used atom&#45;centred&#10;dipole&#45;polarizability based models. We further show that the ESPF&#45;DRF method&#10;provides an accurate description of molecular interactions in both ground and&#10;excited electronic states of the QM system and apply it to predict the gas to&#10;aqueous solution solvatochromic shifts in the UV/visible absorption spectrum of&#10;acrolein.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10483v1) |&#10;| Schrodinger&#39;s Memory: Large Language Models | Wei Wang, Qing Li | &#160;&#160;Memory is the foundation of LLMs&#39; functionality, yet past research has lacked&#10;an in&#45;depth exploration of their memory capabilities and underlying theory.

These assumptions limit their use&#10;when acquisition conditions, such as the subject&#39;s distance from the camera or&#10;the camera&#39;s characteristics, are different than expected, as typically happens&#10;in video surveillance. Additionally, 3DFR algorithms follow various strategies&#10;to address the reconstruction of a 3D shape from 2D data, such as statistical&#10;model fitting, photometric stereo, or deep learning. In the present study, we&#10;explore the application of three 3DFR algorithms representative of the SOTA,&#10;employing each one as the template set generator for a face verification&#10;system. The scores provided by each system are combined by score&#45;level fusion.&#10;We show that the complementarity induced by different 3DFR algorithms improves&#10;performance when tests are conducted at never&#45;seen&#45;before distances from the&#10;camera and camera characteristics (cross&#45;distance and cross&#45;camera settings),&#10;thus encouraging further investigations on multiple 3DFR&#45;based approaches.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10481v1) |&#10;| Addressing misspecification in contextual optimization | Omar Bennouna, Jiawei Zhang, Saurabh Amin, Asuman Ozdaglar | &#160;&#160;We study a linear contextual optimization problem where a decision maker has&#10;access to historical data and contextual features to learn a cost prediction&#10;model aimed at minimizing decision error. We adopt the predict&#45;then&#45;optimize&#10;framework for this analysis. Given that perfect model alignment with reality is&#10;often unrealistic in practice, we focus on scenarios where the chosen&#10;hypothesis set is misspecified. In this context, it remains unclear whether&#10;current contextual optimization approaches can effectively address such model&#10;misspecification. In this paper, we present a novel integrated learning and&#10;optimization approach designed to tackle model misspecification in contextual&#10;optimization. This approach offers theoretical generalizability, tractability,&#10;and optimality guarantees, along with strong practical performance. Our method&#10;involves minimizing a tractable surrogate loss that aligns with the performance&#10;value from cost vector predictions, regardless of whether the model&#10;misspecified or not, and can be optimized in reasonable time. To our knowledge,&#10;no previous work has provided an approach with such guarantees in the context&#10;of model misspecification.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10479v1) |&#10;| Local SGD for Near&#45;Quadratic Problems: Improving Convergence under&#10; &#160;Unconstrained Noise Conditions | Andrey Sadchikov, Savelii Chezhegov, Aleksandr Beznosikov, Alexander Gasnikov | &#160;&#160;Distributed optimization plays an important role in modern large&#45;scale&#10;machine learning and data processing systems by optimizing the utilization of&#10;computational resources. One of the classical and popular approaches is Local&#10;Stochastic Gradient Descent (Local SGD), characterized by multiple local&#10;updates before averaging, which is particularly useful in distributed&#10;environments to reduce communication bottlenecks and improve scalability. A&#10;typical feature of this method is the dependence on the frequency of&#10;communications. But in the case of a quadratic target function with homogeneous&#10;data distribution over all devices, the influence of frequency of&#10;communications vanishes. As a natural consequence, subsequent studies include&#10;the assumption of a Lipschitz Hessian, as this indicates the similarity of the&#10;optimized function to a quadratic one to some extent. However, in order to&#10;extend the completeness of the Local SGD theory and unlock its potential, in&#10;this paper we abandon the Lipschitz Hessian assumption by introducing a new&#10;concept of $textit{approximate quadraticity}$. This assumption gives a new&#10;perspective on problems that have near quadratic properties. In addition,&#10;existing theoretical analyses of Local SGD often assume bounded variance. We,&#10;in turn, consider the unbounded noise condition, which allows us to broaden the&#10;class of studied problems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10478v1) |&#10;| SimInversion: A Simple Framework for Inversion&#45;Based Text&#45;to&#45;Image&#10; &#160;Editing | Qi Qian, Haiyang Xu, Ming Yan, Juhua Hu | &#160;&#160;Diffusion models demonstrate impressive image generation performance with&#10;text guidance. Inspired by the learning process of diffusion, existing images&#10;can be edited according to text by DDIM inversion. However, the vanilla DDIM&#10;inversion is not optimized for classifier&#45;free guidance and the accumulated&#10;error will result in the undesired performance. While many algorithms are&#10;developed to improve the framework of DDIM inversion for editing, in this work,&#10;we investigate the approximation error in DDIM inversion and propose to&#10;disentangle the guidance scale for the source and target branches to reduce the&#10;error while keeping the original framework. Moreover, a better guidance scale&#10;(i.e., 0.5) than default settings can be derived theoretically. Experiments on&#10;PIE&#45;Bench show that our proposal can improve the performance of DDIM inversion&#10;dramatically without sacrificing efficiency.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10476v1) |&#10;| Leadership and Engagement Dynamics in Legislative Twitter Networks:&#10; &#160;Statistical Analysis and Modeling | Carolina Luque, Juan Sosa | &#160;&#160;In this manuscript, we analyze the interaction network on Twitter among&#10;members of the 117th U.S. Congress to assess the visibility of political&#10;leaders and explore how systemic properties and node attributes influence the&#10;formation of legislative connections. We employ descriptive social network&#10;statistical methods, the exponential random graph model (ERGM), and the&#10;stochastic block model (SBM) to evaluate the relative impact of network&#10;systemic properties, as well as institutional and personal traits, on the&#10;generation of online relationships among legislators. Our findings reveal that&#10;legislative networks on social media platforms like Twitter tend to reinforce&#10;the leadership of dominant political actors rather than diminishing their&#10;influence. However, we identify that these leadership roles can manifest in&#10;various forms.

However, previous works either rely on contrastive learning that&#10;suffers false negative problems or are based on reconstruction that learns too&#10;much unessential low&#45;level clues, leading to limited representations for&#10;downstream tasks. Recently, great advances have been made in generative&#10;learning, which is naturally a challenging yet meaningful pretext task to model&#10;the general underlying data distributions. However, the representation learning&#10;capacity of generative models is under&#45;explored, especially for the skeletons&#10;with spacial sparsity and temporal redundancy. To this end, we propose Masked&#10;Conditional Diffusion (MacDiff) as a unified framework for human skeleton&#10;modeling. For the first time, we leverage diffusion models as effective&#10;skeleton representation learners. Specifically, we train a diffusion decoder&#10;conditioned on the representations extracted by a semantic encoder. Random&#10;masking is applied to encoder inputs to introduce a information bottleneck and&#10;remove redundancy of skeletons. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that&#10;our generative objective involves the contrastive learning objective which&#10;aligns the masked and noisy views. Meanwhile, it also enforces the&#10;representation to complement for the noisy view, leading to better&#10;generalization performance. MacDiff achieves state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art performance on&#10;representation learning benchmarks while maintaining the competence for&#10;generative tasks. Moreover, we leverage the diffusion model for data&#10;augmentation, significantly enhancing the fine&#45;tuning performance in scenarios&#10;with scarce labeled data.

Hassan | &#160;&#160;The proliferation of open Pre&#45;trained Language Models (PTLMs) on model&#10;registry platforms like Hugging Face (HF) presents both opportunities and&#10;challenges for companies building products around them. Similar to traditional&#10;software dependencies, PTLMs continue to evolve after a release. However, the&#10;current state of release practices of PTLMs on model registry platforms are&#10;plagued by a variety of inconsistencies, such as ambiguous naming conventions&#10;and inaccessible model training documentation. Given the knowledge gap on&#10;current PTLM release practices, our empirical study uses a mixed&#45;methods&#10;approach to analyze the releases of 52,227 PTLMs on the most well&#45;known model&#10;registry, HF. Our results reveal 148 different naming practices for PTLM&#10;releases, with 40.87% of changes to model weight files not represented in the&#10;adopted name&#45;based versioning practice or their documentation. In addition, we&#10;identified that the 52,227 PTLMs are derived from only 299 different base&#10;models (the modified original models used to create 52,227 PTLMs), with&#10;Fine&#45;tuning and Quantization being the most prevalent modification methods&#10;applied to these base models. Significant gaps in release transparency, in&#10;terms of training dataset specifications and model card availability, still&#10;exist, highlighting the need for standardized documentation. While we&#10;identified a model naming practice explicitly differentiating between major and&#10;minor PTLM releases, we did not find any significant difference in the types of&#10;changes that went into either type of releases, suggesting that major/minor&#10;version numbers for PTLMs often are chosen arbitrarily. Our findings provide&#10;valuable insights to improve PTLM release practices, nudging the field towards&#10;more formal semantic versioning practices.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10472v1) |&#10;| Real&#45;Time Whole&#45;Body Control of Legged Robots with Model&#45;Predictive Path&#10; &#160;Integral Control | Juan Alvarez&#45;Padilla, John Z. Zhang, Sofia Kwok, John M. Dolan, Zachary Manchester | &#160;&#160;This paper presents a system for enabling real&#45;time synthesis of whole&#45;body&#10;locomotion and manipulation policies for real&#45;world legged robots. Motivated by&#10;recent advancements in robot simulation, we leverage the efficient&#10;parallelization capabilities of the MuJoCo simulator to achieve fast sampling&#10;over the robot state and action trajectories. Our results show surprisingly&#10;effective real&#45;world locomotion and manipulation capabilities with a very&#10;simple control strategy. We demonstrate our approach on several hardware and&#10;simulation experiments: robust locomotion over flat and uneven terrains,&#10;climbing over a box whose height is comparable to the robot, and pushing a box&#10;to a goal position. To our knowledge, this is the first successful deployment&#10;of whole&#45;body sampling&#45;based MPC on real&#45;world legged robot hardware.&#10;Experiment videos and code can be found at: https://whole&#45;body&#45;mppi.github.io/&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10469v1) |&#10;| Assortativity in sympatric speciation and species classification | Joao U. F. Lizarraga, Flavia M. D. Marquitti, Marcus A. M. de Aguiar | &#160;&#160;We investigate the role of assortative mating in speciation using the&#10;sympatric model of Derrida and Higgs. The model explores the idea that genetic&#10;differences create incompatibilities between individuals, preventing mating if&#10;the number of such differences is too large. Speciation, however, only happens&#10;in this mating system if the number of genes is large. Here we show that&#10;speciation with small genome sizes can occur if assortative mating is&#10;introduced. In our model individuals are represented by three chromosomes: one&#10;responsible for reproductive compatibility, one for coding the trait on which&#10;assortativity will operate, and a neutral chromosome. Reproduction is possible&#10;if individuals are genetically similar with respect to the first chromosome,&#10;but among these compatible mating partners, the one with the most similar trait&#10;coded by the second chromosome is selected. We show that this type of&#10;assortativity facilitates speciation, which can happen with a small number of&#10;genes in the first chromosome. Species, classified according to reproductive&#10;isolation, dictated by the first chromosome, can display different traits&#10;values, as measured by the second and the third chromosomes. Therefore, species&#10;can also be identified based on similarity of the neutral trait, which works as&#10;a proxy for reproductive isolation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10466v1) |&#10;| A stabilized total pressure&#45;formulation of the Biot&#39;s poroelasticity&#10; &#160;equations in frequency domain: numerical analysis and applications | Cristian Cárcamo, Alfonso Caiazzo, Felipe Galarce, Joaquín Mura | &#160;&#160;This work focuses on the numerical solution of the dynamics of a poroelastic&#10;material in the frequency domain. We provide a detailed stability analysis&#10;based on the application of the Fredholm alternative in the continuous case,&#10;considering a total pressure formulation of the Biot&#39;s equations. In the&#10;discrete setting, we propose a stabilized equal order finite element method&#10;complemented by an additional pressure stabilization to enhance the robustness&#10;of the numerical scheme with respect to the fluid permeability. Utilizing the&#10;Fredholm alternative, we extend the well&#45;posedness results to the discrete&#10;setting, obtaining theoretical optimal convergence for the case of linear&#10;finite elements. We present different numerical experiments to validate the&#10;proposed method. First, we consider model problems with known analytic&#10;solutions in two and three dimensions. As next, we show that the method is&#10;robust for a wide range of permeabilities, including the case of discontinuous&#10;coefficients. Lastly, we show the application for the simulation of brain&#10;elastography on a realistic brain geometry obtained from medical imaging.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10465v1) |&#10;| New Direct Sum Tests | Alek Westover, Edward Yu, Kai Zheng | &#160;&#160;A function $f:[n]^{d} to mathbb{F}_2$ is a defn{direct sum} if there are&#10;functions $L_i:[n]to mathbb{F}_2$ such that ${f(x) = sum_{i}L_i(x_i)}$. In&#10;this work we give multiple results related to the property testing of direct&#10;sums.&#10; &#160;Our first result concerns a test proposed by Dinur and Golubev in 2019. We&#10;call their test the Diamond test and show that it is indeed a direct sum&#10;tester. More specifically, we show that if a function $f$ is $epsilon$&#45;far&#10;from being a direct sum function, then the Diamond test rejects $f$ with&#10;probability at least $Omega_{n,epsilon}(1)$. Even in the case of $n = 2$, the&#10;Diamond test is, to the best of our knowledge, novel and yields a new tester&#10;for the classic property of affinity.&#10; &#160;Apart from the Diamond test, we also analyze a broad family of direct sum&#10;tests, which at a high level, run an arbitrary affinity test on the restriction&#10;of $f$ to a random hypercube inside of $[n]^d$. This family of tests includes&#10;the direct sum test analyzed in cite{di19}, but does not include the Diamond&#10;test. As an application of our result, we obtain a direct sum test which works&#10;in the online adversary model of cite{KRV}.&#10; &#160;Finally, we also discuss a Fourier analytic interpretation of the diamond&#10;tester in the $n=2$ case, as well as prove local correction results for direct&#10;sum as conjectured by Dinur and Golubev.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10464v1) |&#10;| Kolmogorov&#45;Arnold Networks in Low&#45;Data Regimes: A Comparative Study with&#10; &#160;Multilayer Perceptrons | Farhad Pourkamali&#45;Anaraki | &#160;&#160;Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) have long been a cornerstone in deep learning,&#10;known for their capacity to model complex relationships. Recently,&#10;Kolmogorov&#45;Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a compelling alternative,&#10;utilizing highly flexible learnable activation functions directly on network&#10;edges, a departure from the neuron&#45;centric approach of MLPs. However, KANs&#10;significantly increase the number of learnable parameters, raising concerns&#10;about their effectiveness in data&#45;scarce environments. This paper presents a&#10;comprehensive comparative study of MLPs and KANs from both algorithmic and&#10;experimental perspectives, with a focus on low&#45;data regimes. We introduce an&#10;effective technique for designing MLPs with unique, parameterized activation&#10;functions for each neuron, enabling a more balanced comparison with KANs. Using&#10;empirical evaluations on simulated data and two real&#45;world data sets from&#10;medicine and engineering, we explore the trade&#45;offs between model complexity&#10;and accuracy, with particular attention to the role of network depth. Our&#10;findings show that MLPs with individualized activation functions achieve&#10;significantly higher predictive accuracy with only a modest increase in&#10;parameters, especially when the sample size is limited to around one hundred.&#10;For example, in a three&#45;class classification problem within additive&#10;manufacturing, MLPs achieve a median accuracy of 0.91, significantly&#10;outperforming KANs, which only reach a median accuracy of 0.53 with default&#10;hyperparameters. These results offer valuable insights into the impact of&#10;activation function selection in neural networks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10463v1) |&#10;| Effects of synapse location, delay and background stochastic activity on&#10; &#160;synchronising hippocampal CA1 neurons | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore | &#160;&#160;We study the synchronisation of neurons in a realistic model under the&#10;Hodgkin&#45;Huxley dynamics. To focus on the role of the different locations of the&#10;excitatory synapses, we use two identical neurons where the set of input&#10;signals is grouped at two different distances from the soma. The system is&#10;intended to represent a CA1 hippocampal neuron in which the synapses arriving&#10;from the CA3 neurons of the trisynaptic pathway appear to be localised in the&#10;apical dendritic region and are, in principle, either proximal or distal to the&#10;soma. Synchronisation is studied using a specifically defined spiking&#10;correlation function as a function of various parameters such as the distance&#10;from the soma of one of the synaptic groups, the inhibition weight and the&#10;associated activation delay. We found that the neurons&#39; spiking activity&#10;depends nonmonotonically on the relative dendritic location of the synapses and&#10;their inhibitory weight, whereas the synchronisation measure always decreases&#10;with inhibition, and strongly depends on its activation time delay. The&#10;background activity on the somas results essentially independent on the&#10;fluctuation intensity and strongly support the importance of the balance&#10;between inhibition and excitation for neuronal synchronization.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10460v1) |&#10;| Efficiently Crowdsourcing Visual Importance with Punch&#45;Hole Annotation | Minsuk Chang, Soohyun Lee, Aeri Cho, Hyeon Jeon, Seokhyeon Park, Cindy Xiong Bearfield, Jinwook Seo | &#160;&#160;We introduce a novel crowdsourcing method for identifying important areas in&#10;graphical images through punch&#45;hole labeling. Traditional methods, such as gaze&#10;trackers and mouse&#45;based annotations, which generate continuous data, can be&#10;impractical in crowdsourcing scenarios. They require many participants, and the&#10;outcome data can be noisy. In contrast, our method first segments the graphical&#10;image with a grid and drops a portion of the patches (punch holes). Then, we&#10;iteratively ask the labeler to validate each annotation with holes, narrowing&#10;down the annotation only having the most important area. This approach aims to&#10;reduce annotation noise in crowdsourcing by standardizing the annotations while&#10;enhancing labeling efficiency and reliability. Preliminary findings from&#10;fundamental charts demonstrate that punch&#45;hole labeling can effectively&#10;pinpoint critical regions. This also highlights its potential for broader&#10;application in visualization research, particularly in studying large&#45;scale&#10;users&#39; graphical perception. Our future work aims to enhance the algorithm to&#10;achieve faster labeling speed and prove its utility through large&#45;scale&#10;experiments.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10459v1) |&#10;| Full distribution of local observables in an exactly solvable current&#10; &#160;carrying steady states of a driven XXZ chain | Sandipan Manna, G J Sreejith | &#160;&#160;Current carrying steady states of interacting spins chains exhibit rich&#10;structures generated through an interplay of current induced correlations and&#10;energetic constraints from the Hamiltonian. The XXZ spin chain when coupled to&#10;maximally polarizing Lindblad terms admits an exact solution in a matrix&#10;product state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations&#10;and distributions of simple local spin observables in the non equilibrium&#10;steady state (NESS). We present exact expressions for spin correlators, entropy&#10;per site, cumulant generating functions for distributions of local observables&#10;in the XX limit (Ising anisotropy $Delta=0$). Further, we use the exact MPS&#10;solution in systems with $Delta&gt;0$, to numerically exactly calculate the&#10;entropy, correlations, as well as distributions of spin observables in blocks&#10;as large as $nsim 200$ sites allowing an estimation of the rate functions. The&#10;$z$ magnetization distribution is consistant with short range spin correlations&#10;in the $z$ direction while the $x$&#45;magnetization shows a double peak structure&#10;at larger $Delta$ suggesting short range ferromagnetic ordering. We find that&#10;the distribution of $z$&#45;magnetization sharpens for parameters where the current&#10;is maximized.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10458v1) |&#10;| Mean Residual Life Ageing Intensity Function | Ashutosh Singh, Ishapathik Das, Asok Kumar Nanda, Sumen Sen | &#160;&#160;The ageing intensity function is a powerful analytical tool that provides&#10;valuable insights into the ageing process across diverse domains such as&#10;reliability engineering, actuarial science, and healthcare. Its applications&#10;continue to expand as researchers delve deeper into understanding the complex&#10;dynamics of ageing and its implications for society. One common approach to&#10;defining the ageing intensity function is through the hazard rate or failure&#10;rate function, extensively explored in scholarly literature. Equally&#10;significant to the hazard rate function is the mean residual life function,&#10;which plays a crucial role in analyzing the ageing patterns exhibited by units&#10;or components. This article introduces the mean residual life ageing intensity&#10;(MRLAI) function to delve into component ageing behaviours across various&#10;distributions. Additionally, we scrutinize the closure properties of the MRLAI&#10;function across different reliability operations. Furthermore, a new order&#10;termed the mean residual life ageing intensity order is defined to analyze the&#10;ageing behaviour of a system, and the closure property of this order under&#10;various reliability operations is discussed.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10456v1) |&#10;| Quantile Fourier regressions for decision making under uncertainty | Arash Khojaste, Geoffrey Pritchard, Golbon Zakeri | &#160;&#160;Weconsider Markov decision processes arising from a Markov model of an&#10;underlying natural phenomenon. Such phenomena are usually periodic (e.g.&#10;annual) in time, and so the Markov processes modelling them must be&#10;time&#45;inhomogeneous, with cyclostationary rather than stationary behaviour. We&#10;describe a technique for constructing such processes that allows for periodic&#10;variations both in the values taken by the process and in the serial dependence&#10;structure. We include two illustrative numerical examples: a hydropower&#10;scheduling problem and a model of offshore wind power integration.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10455v1) |&#10;| The Debiased Near&#45;Earth Object Population from ATLAS Telescopes | Rogerio Deienno, Larry Denneau, David Nesvorný, David Vokrouhlický, William F. Bottke, Robert Jedicke, Shantanu Naidu, Steven R. Chesley, Davide Farnocchia, Paul W. Chodas | &#160;&#160;This work is dedicated to debias the Near&#45;Earth Objects (NEO) population&#10;based on observations from the Asteroid Terrestrial&#45;impact Last Alert System&#10;(ATLAS) telescopes. We have applied similar methods used to develop the&#10;recently released NEO model generator (NEOMOD), once debiasing the NEO&#10;population using data from Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) G96 telescope. ATLAS is&#10;composed of four different telescopes. We first analyzed observational data&#10;from each of all four telescopes separately and later combined them. Our&#10;results highlight main differences between CSS and ATLAS, e.g., sky coverage&#10;and survey power at debiasing the NEO population. ATLAS has a much larger sky&#10;coverage than CSS, allowing it to find bright NEOs that would be constantly&#10;&quot;hiding&quot; from CSS. Consequently, ATLAS is more powerful than CSS at debiasing&#10;the NEO population for H $&#10;esssim$ 19. With its intrinsically greater&#10;sensitivity and emphasis on observing near opposition, CSS excels in the&#10;debiasing of smaller objects. ATLAS, as an all sky survey designed to find&#10;imminent hazardous objects, necessarily spends a significant fraction of time&#10;looking at places on the sky where objects do not appear, reducing its power&#10;for debiasing the population of small objects. We estimate a NEO population&#10;completeness of $approx$ 88%$^{+3%}_{&#45;2%}$ for H $&lt;$ 17.75 and $approx$&#10;36%$^{+1%}_{&#45;1%}$ for H $&lt;$ 22.25. Those numbers are similar to previous&#10;estimates (within error bars for H $&lt;$ 17.75) from CSS, yet, around 3% and 8%&#10;smaller at their face values, respectively. We also confirm previous finding&#10;that the $&#10;u_6$ secular resonance is the main source of small and faint NEOs&#10;at H = 28, whereas the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter dominates for&#10;larger and brighter NEOs at H = 15.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10453v1) |&#10;| Signed Graph Autoencoder for Explainable and Polarization&#45;Aware Network&#10; &#160;Embeddings | Nikolaos Nakis, Chrysoula Kosma, Giannis Nikolentzos, Michalis Chatzianastasis, Iakovos Evdaimon, Michalis Vazirgiannis | &#160;&#160;Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant&#10;attention in recent years for their ability to extract informative latent&#10;representations, characterizing the structure of complex topologies, such as&#10;graphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited&#10;focus on developing and evaluating explainable neural&#45;based graph generative&#10;models specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we&#10;propose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE&#10;extracts node&#45;level representations that express node memberships over distinct&#10;extreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is&#10;achieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its&#10;polarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for&#10;analyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with&#10;relational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation&#10;demonstrates the SGAAEs&#39; capability to successfully infer node memberships over&#10;the different underlying latent structures while extracting competing&#10;communities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the&#10;network. Additionally, we introduce the 2&#45;level network polarization problem&#10;and show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model&#10;achieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across&#10;four real&#45;world datasets, outperforming several baseline models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10452v1) |&#10;| Why you should also use OLS estimation of tail exponents | Thiago Trafane Oliveira Santos, Daniel Oliveira Cajueiro | &#160;&#160;Even though practitioners often estimate Pareto exponents running OLS&#10;rank&#45;size regressions, the usual recommendation is to use the Hill MLE with a&#10;small&#45;sample correction instead, due to its unbiasedness and efficiency. In&#10;this paper, we advocate that you should also apply OLS in empirical&#10;applications. On the one hand, we demonstrate that, with a small&#45;sample&#10;correction, the OLS estimator is also unbiased. On the other hand, we show that&#10;the MLE assigns significantly greater weight to smaller observations. This&#10;suggests that the OLS estimator may outperform the MLE in cases where the&#10;distribution is (i) strictly Pareto but only in the upper tail or (ii)&#10;regularly varying rather than strictly Pareto. We substantiate our theoretical&#10;findings with Monte Carlo simulations and real&#45;world applications,&#10;demonstrating the practical relevance of the OLS method in estimating tail&#10;exponents.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10448v1) |&#10;| Hydrodynamic hovering of swimming bacteria above surfaces | Pyae Hein Htet, Debasish Das, Eric Lauga | &#160;&#160;Flagellated bacteria are hydrodynamically attracted to rigid walls, yet past&#10;work shows a &#39;hovering&#39; state where they swim stably at a finite height above&#10;surfaces. We use numerics and theory to reveal the physical origin of hovering.&#10;Simulations first show that hovering requires an elongated cell body and&#10;results from a tilt away from the wall. Theoretical models then identify two&#10;essential asymmetries: the response of width&#45;asymmetric cells to active flows&#10;created by length&#45;asymmetric cells. A minimal model reconciles near and&#10;far&#45;field hydrodynamics, capturing all key features of hovering.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10447v1) |&#10;| KoroT&#45;3E: A Personalized Musical Mnemonics Tool for Enhancing Memory&#10; &#160;Retention of Complex Computer Science Concepts | Xiangzhe Yuan, Jiajun Wang, Siying Hu, Andrew Cheung, Zhicong Lu | &#160;&#160;As the demand for computer science (CS) skills grows, mastering foundational&#10;concepts is crucial yet challenging for novice learners. To address this&#10;challenge, we present KoroT&#45;3E, an AI&#45;based system that creates personalized&#10;musical mnemonics to enhance both memory retention and understanding of&#10;concepts in CS. KoroT&#45;3E enables users to transform complex concepts into&#10;memorable lyrics and compose melodies that suit their musical preferences. We&#10;conducted semi&#45;structured interviews (n=12) to investigate why novice learners&#10;find it challenging to memorize and understand CS concepts. The findings,&#10;combined with constructivist learning theory, established our initial design,&#10;which was then refined following consultations with CS education experts. An&#10;empirical experiment(n=36) showed that those using KoroT&#45;3E (n=18)&#10;significantly outperformed the control group (n=18), with improved memory&#10;efficiency, increased motivation, and a positive learning experience.

It is&#10;a challenging problem due to the intricate characteristics of insects. In this&#10;paper, we present DeWi, novel learning assistance for insect pest&#10;classification. With a one&#45;stage and alternating training strategy, DeWi&#10;simultaneously improves several Convolutional Neural Networks in two&#10;perspectives: discrimination (by optimizing a triplet margin loss in a&#10;supervised training manner) and generalization (via data augmentation). From&#10;that, DeWi can learn discriminative and in&#45;depth features of insect pests&#10;(deep) yet still generalize well to a large number of insect categories (wide).&#10;Experimental results show that DeWi achieves the highest performances on two&#10;insect pest classification benchmarks (76.44% accuracy on the IP102 dataset&#10;and 99.79% accuracy on the D0 dataset, respectively).

Behavior trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robot&#10;task planning for their modularity and flexibility, but manually designing them&#10;can be effort&#45;intensive. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been&#10;applied in robotic task planning for generating action sequences, but their&#10;ability to generate BTs has not been fully investigated. To this end, We&#10;propose LLM as BT&#45;planner, a novel framework to leverage LLMs for BT generation&#10;in robotic assembly task planning and execution. Four in&#45;context learning&#10;methods are introduced to utilize the natural language processing and inference&#10;capabilities of LLMs to produce task plans in BT format, reducing manual effort&#10;and ensuring robustness and comprehensibility. We also evaluate the performance&#10;of fine&#45;tuned, fewer&#45;parameter LLMs on the same tasks. Experiments in simulated&#10;and real&#45;world settings show that our framework enhances LLMs&#39; performance in&#10;BT generation, improving success rates in BT generation through in&#45;context&#10;learning and supervised fine&#45;tuning.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10444v1) |&#10;| The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration.

Aguilar, Ralph Bohlin, Misty Cracraft, Marjorie Decleir, Andras Gaspar, David R. Law, Alberto Noriega&#45;Crespo, Michael Regan | &#160;&#160;The absolute flux calibration of the Mid&#45;Infrared Instrument Imaging and&#10;Coronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first&#10;2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the&#10;flux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays,&#10;and different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining&#10;observed aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions&#10;based on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of&#10;these observations were combined with model point&#45;spread&#45;functions to measure&#10;the corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with&#10;time, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time,&#10;rate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations&#10;were with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately&#10;every month revealed a modest time&#45;dependent response loss seen mainly at the&#10;longest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential&#10;with a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the&#10;band&#45;dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was&#10;found to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different&#10;subarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting&#10;for the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors&#10;measured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The&#10;formal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are&#10;0.3 to 1.0%, with longer&#45;wavelength bands generally having larger&#10;uncertainties.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10443v1) |&#10;| CtRNet&#45;X: Camera&#45;to&#45;Robot Pose Estimation in Real&#45;world Conditions Using&#10; &#160;a Single Camera | Jingpei Lu, Zekai Liang, Tristin Xie, Florian Ritcher, Shan Lin, Sainan Liu, Michael C. Yip | &#160;&#160;Camera&#45;to&#45;robot calibration is crucial for vision&#45;based robot control and&#10;requires effort to make it accurate. Recent advancements in markerless pose&#10;estimation methods have eliminated the need for time&#45;consuming physical setups&#10;for camera&#45;to&#45;robot calibration. While the existing markerless pose estimation&#10;methods have demonstrated impressive accuracy without the need for cumbersome&#10;setups, they rely on the assumption that all the robot joints are visible&#10;within the camera&#39;s field of view. However, in practice, robots usually move in&#10;and out of view, and some portion of the robot may stay out&#45;of&#45;frame during the&#10;whole manipulation task due to real&#45;world constraints, leading to a lack of&#10;sufficient visual features and subsequent failure of these approaches. To&#10;address this challenge and enhance the applicability to vision&#45;based robot&#10;control, we propose a novel framework capable of estimating the robot pose with&#10;partially visible robot manipulators. Our approach leverages the&#10;Vision&#45;Language Models for fine&#45;grained robot components detection, and&#10;integrates it into a keypoint&#45;based pose estimation network, which enables more&#10;robust performance in varied operational conditions. The framework is evaluated&#10;on both public robot datasets and self&#45;collected partial&#45;view datasets to&#10;demonstrate our robustness and generalizability. As a result, this method is&#10;effective for robot pose estimation in a wider range of real&#45;world manipulation&#10;scenarios.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10441v1) |&#10;| Successive topological phase transitions in two distinct spin&#45;flop&#10; &#160;phases on the honeycomb lattice | Xudong Li, Jize Zhao, Jinbin Li, Qiang Luo | &#160;&#160;The Kitaev magnets with bond&#45;dependent interactions have garnered&#10;considerable attention in recent years for their ability to harbor exotic&#10;phases and nontrivial excitations. The topological magnons, which are indicated&#10;by nonzero Chern number and thermal Hall conductivity, are proposed to&#10;partially explain thermal Hall measurements in real materials. Hitherto,&#10;topological magnons have been extensively explored when the magnetic field is&#10;normal to the honeycomb plane, but their topological characteristics are less&#10;studied in the presence of in&#45;plane magnetic field. Here, we study two distinct&#10;in&#45;plane field induced spin&#45;flop phases in the $Gamma$&#45;$Gamma&#39;$ model, both&#10;of which are off&#45;diagonal couplings that have intimate relation to the Kitaev&#10;interaction. The two spin&#45;flop phases are distinguished by their out&#45;of&#45;plane&#10;spin components which can be either antiparallel or parallel, thus dubbing&#10;antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) spin&#45;flop phases, respectively.&#10;We map out topological phase diagrams for both phases, revealing a rich pattern&#10;of the Chern number over exchange parameters and magnetic field. We&#10;analytically calculate the boundaries of topological phase transitions when the&#10;magnetic field is along the $a$ and $b$ directions. We find that the thermal&#10;Hall conductivity and its derivative display contrasting behaviors when&#10;crossing different topological phase transitions. The striking difference of&#10;the two phases lies in that when the magnetic field is along the $b$ direction,&#10;topological magnons are totally absent in the AFM spin&#45;flop phase, while they&#10;can survive in the FM analogue in certain parameter regions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10439v1) |&#10;| A functorial approach to $n$&#45;abelian categories | Vitor Gulisz | &#160;&#160;We develop a functorial approach to the study of $n$&#45;abelian categories by&#10;reformulating their axioms in terms of their categories of finitely presented&#10;functors. Such an approach allows the use of classical homological algebra and&#10;representation theory techniques to understand higher homological algebra. As&#10;an application, we present two possible generalizations of the axioms &quot;every&#10;monomorphism is a kernel&quot; and &quot;every epimorphism is a cokernel&quot; of an abelian&#10;category to $n$&#45;abelian categories. We also specialize our results to modules&#10;over rings, thereby describing when the category of finitely generated&#10;projective modules over a ring is $n$&#45;abelian. Moreover, we establish a&#10;correspondence for $n$&#45;abelian categories with additive generators, which&#10;extends the higher Auslander correspondence.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10438v1) |&#10;| Color symmetry breaking in the Potts spin glass | Jean&#45;Christophe Mourrat | &#160;&#160;The Potts spin glass is an analogue of the Sherrington&#45;Kirkpatrick model in&#10;which each spin can take one of $kappa$ possible values, which we interpret as&#10;colors.

Whole genome sequence data augmented with demographic metadata&#10;provides the best opportunity to do this. We use Random Forest Decision Tree&#10;models to analyse a combination of over 4000 SARS&#45;CoV2 sequences from a densely&#10;sampled, mixed urban and rural population (Tayside) in Scotland in the period&#10;from August 2020 to July 2021, with fine scale geographical and&#10;socio&#45;demographic metadata. Comparing periods in versus out of &quot;lockdown&quot;&#10;restrictions, we show using genetic distance relationships that individuals&#10;from more deprived areas are more likely to get infected during lockdown but&#10;less likely to spread the infection further. As disadvantaged communities were&#10;the most affected by both COVID&#45;19 and its restrictions, our finding has&#10;important implications for informing future approaches to control future&#10;pandemics driven by similar respiratory infections.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10436v1) |&#10;| A study of pure multi&#45;strange hadrons production in Pb+Pb collisions at&#10; &#160;LHC energies using HYDJET++ model | Gauri Devi, B.

We have simulated the $p_{T}$&#45;spectra and elliptic flow ($v_{2}$)&#10;of $phi$&#45;meson and $Omega$&#45;baryons comparing our results with ALICE&#10;experimental data and several phenomenological models (HIJING/$Boverline{B}$,&#10;VISHNU, EPOS, AMPT, and Krakow) across various centrality intervals.&#10;Additionally, we have calculated the nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$ and&#10;$R_{CP}$), which provide a perception of jet quenching phenomena. Hence, our&#10;findings enable the study of the energy and system dependence of $phi$ and&#10;$Omega$ hadrons production over a wide range of ultra&#45;relativistic collision&#10;energies. We also present the particle ratios ($Omega/phi$,&#10;$overline{Omega}^{+}/Omega^{&#45;}$, $Omega/pi$, and $phi/pi$), offering&#10;insights on the strangeness enhancement and chemical properties of the medium&#10;at both LHC collision energies.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10435v1) |&#10;| Magnetic metamaterials by ion&#45;implantation | Christina Vantaraki, Petter Ström, Tuan T.

By implanting $^{56}$Fe$^{+}$ ions,&#10;we are able to introduce magnetic functionality in a controlled manner into&#10;continuous Pd thin films, achieving 3D spatial resolution down to a few tens of&#10;nanometers. Our results demonstrate the successful application of this&#10;technique in fabricating square artificial spin ice lattices, which exhibit&#10;well&#45;defined magnetization textures and interactions among the patterned&#10;magnetic elements.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10433v1) |&#10;| Structure&#45;preserving learning for multi&#45;symplectic PDEs | Süleyman Yıldız, Pawan Goyal, Peter Benner | &#160;&#160;This paper presents an energy&#45;preserving machine learning method for&#10;inferring reduced&#45;order models (ROMs) by exploiting the multi&#45;symplectic form&#10;of partial differential equations (PDEs). The vast majority of&#10;energy&#45;preserving reduced&#45;order methods use symplectic Galerkin projection to&#10;construct reduced&#45;order Hamiltonian models by projecting the full models onto a&#10;symplectic subspace. However, symplectic projection requires the existence of&#10;fully discrete operators, and in many cases, such as black&#45;box PDE solvers,&#10;these operators are inaccessible. In this work, we propose an energy&#45;preserving&#10;machine learning method that can infer the dynamics of the given PDE using data&#10;only, so that the proposed framework does not depend on the fully discrete&#10;operators. In this context, the proposed method is non&#45;intrusive. The proposed&#10;method is grey box in the sense that it requires only some basic knowledge of&#10;the multi&#45;symplectic model at the partial differential equation level. We prove&#10;that the proposed method satisfies spatially discrete local energy conservation&#10;and preserves the multi&#45;symplectic conservation laws. We test our method on the&#10;linear wave equation, the Korteweg&#45;de Vries equation, and the&#10;Zakharov&#45;Kuznetsov equation. We test the generalization of our learned models&#10;by testing them far outside the training time interval.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10432v1) |&#10;| Hippocampal synchronization in a realistic CA1 neuron model | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore | &#160;&#160;This work delves into studying the synchronization in two realistic neuron&#10;models using Hodgkin&#45;Huxley dynamics. Unlike simplistic point&#45;like models,&#10;excitatory synapses are here randomly distributed along the dendrites,&#10;introducing strong stochastic contributions into their signal propagation. To&#10;focus on the role of different excitatory positions, we use two copies of the&#10;same neuron whose synapses are located at different distances from the soma and&#10;are exposed to identical Poissonian distributed current pulses. The&#10;synchronization is investigated through a specifically defined spiking&#10;correlation function, and its behavior is analyzed as a function of several&#10;parameters: inhibition weight, distance from the soma of one synaptic group,&#10;excitatory inactivation delay, and weight of the excitatory synapses.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10431v1) |&#10;| Meta&#45;Whisper: Speech&#45;Based Meta&#45;ICL for ASR on Low&#45;Resource Languages | Ming&#45;Hao Hsu, Kuan Po Huang, Hung&#45;yi Lee | &#160;&#160;This paper presents Meta&#45;Whisper, a novel approach to improve automatic&#10;speech recognition (ASR) for low&#45;resource languages using the Whisper model.

This approach mitigates risks&#10;associated with compromised or untrusted devices, common in traditional quantum&#10;communication.&#10; &#160;In this paper, we propose the first of its kind DI&#45;QSDC protocol with user&#10;identity authentication. This ensures the authenticity of both the sender and&#10;receiver prior to message exchange. We then discuss the security of the&#10;proposed protocol against common attacks, demonstrating that no eavesdropper&#10;gains any information from either the quantum or the classical channel. Next,&#10;we implement the protocol on IBM&#39;s quantum hardware and evaluate its&#10;performance in a realistic noisy environment. Additionally, by simulating&#10;common attack models, we showcase that the protocol is secure against any&#10;eavesdropper in the channel.

Breakdown of&#10;time&#45;reversal symmetry (BTRS) is a hallmark of such dissipative non&#45;equilibrium&#10;dynamics. We introduce a robust, experimentally accessible, noninvasive,&#10;quantitative measure of BTRS in terms of the Kullback&#45;Leibler divergence in&#10;collision events, demonstrated in our novel artificial active matter, comprised&#10;of battery&#45;powered spherical rolling robots whose energetics in different modes&#10;of motion can be measured with high precision. Our dimensionless measure&#10;characterizes how dissipation and internal energetics are influenced by&#10;kinematic constraints from interactions with the environment. We propose this&#10;measure of BTRS as an empirical estimate of the distance from equilibrium. An&#10;energetic insight into this departure of active matter from equilibrium comes&#10;from our demonstration of a non&#45;trivial fluctuation symmetry, which reveals a&#10;potentially universal thermodynamic characteristic of active energetics. As a&#10;many&#45;body consequence of BTRS in our experimental active system, we demonstrate&#10;the emergence of activity&#45;induced herding, which has no equilibrium analogue.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10425v1) |&#10;| Unveiling V Modes: Enhancing CMB Sensitivity to BSM Physics with a&#10; &#160;Non&#45;Ideal Half&#45;Wave Plate | N. Raffuzzi, M. Lembo, S. Giardiello, M. Gerbino, M. Lattanzi, P. Natoli, L. Pagano | &#160;&#160;V&#45;mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background is expected to be&#10;vanishingly small in the $Lambda$CDM model and, hence, usually ignored.&#10;Nonetheless, several astrophysical effects, as well as beyond standard model&#10;physics could produce it at a detectable level. A realistic half&#45;wave plate &#45;&#10;an optical element commonly used in CMB experiments to modulate the polarized&#10;signal &#45; can provide sensitivity to V modes without significantly spoiling that&#10;to linear polarization. We assess this sensitivity for some new&#45;generation CMB&#10;experiments, such as the LiteBIRD satellite, the ground&#45;based Simons&#10;Observatory and a CMB&#45;S4&#45;like experiment. We forecast the efficiency of these&#10;experiments to constrain the phenomenology of certain classes of BSM models&#10;inducing mixing of linear polarization states and generation of V modes in the&#10;CMB. We find that new&#45;generation experiments can improve current limits by&#10;1&#45;to&#45;3 orders of magnitude, depending on the data combination. The inclusion of&#10;V&#45;mode information dramatically boosts the sensitivity to these BSM models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10424v1) |&#10;| Initial data for a deformed isolated horizon | Aleš Flandera, David Kofroň, Tomáš Ledvinka | &#160;&#160;Within the isolated horizon formalism, we investigate a static axisymmetric&#10;space&#45;time of a black hole influenced by matter in its neighborhood. To&#10;illustrate the role of ingredients and assumptions in this formalism, we first&#10;show how, in spherical symmetry, the field equations and gauge conditions imply&#10;the isolated horizon initial data leading to the Schwarzschild space&#45;time.&#10;Then, we construct the initial data for a static axisymmetric isolated horizon&#10;representing a deformed black hole. The space&#45;time description in the&#10;Bondi&#45;like coordinates is then found as a series expansion in the vicinity of&#10;the horizon. To graphically illustrate this construction, we also find a&#10;numerical solution for a black hole deformed by a particular analytic model of&#10;a thin accretion disk. We also discuss how an accretion disk affects the&#10;analytical properties of the horizon geometry.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10423v1) |&#10;| Learning Semi&#45;Supervised Medical Image Segmentation from Spatial&#10; &#160;Registration | Qianying Liu, Paul Henderson, Xiao Gu, Hang Dai, Fani Deligianni | &#160;&#160;Semi&#45;supervised medical image segmentation has shown promise in training&#10;models with limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. However,&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methods ignore a potentially valuable source of unsupervised&#10;semantic information &#45;&#45; spatial registration transforms between image volumes.&#10;To address this, we propose CCT&#45;R, a contrastive cross&#45;teaching framework&#10;incorporating registration information. To leverage the semantic information&#10;available in registrations between volume pairs, CCT&#45;R incorporates two&#10;proposed modules: Registration Supervision Loss (RSL) and Registration&#45;Enhanced&#10;Positive Sampling (REPS). The RSL leverages segmentation knowledge derived from&#10;transforms between labeled and unlabeled volume pairs, providing an additional&#10;source of pseudo&#45;labels. REPS enhances contrastive learning by identifying&#10;anatomically&#45;corresponding positives across volumes using registration&#10;transforms. Experimental results on two challenging medical segmentation&#10;benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CCT&#45;R across&#10;various semi&#45;supervised settings, with as few as one labeled case.

A number of recent methods have shown&#10;how to perform high&#45;dimensional, unbinned unfolding using machine learning.&#10;However, one of the assumptions in all of these methods is that the detector&#10;response is accurately modeled in the Monte Carlo simulation. In practice, the&#10;detector response depends on a number of nuisance parameters that can be&#10;constrained with data.

Given a text query, RGS&#10;determines a stable grasp pose to manipulate the referred object in the robot&#39;s&#10;workspace. RGS comprises two steps: visual grounding and grasp pose estimation.&#10;Recent studies leverage powerful Vision&#45;Language Models (VLMs) for visually&#10;grounding free&#45;flowing natural language in real&#45;world robotic execution.&#10;However, comparisons in complex, cluttered environments with multiple instances&#10;of the same object are lacking. This paper introduces HiFi&#45;CS, featuring&#10;hierarchical application of Featurewise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to fuse image&#10;and text embeddings, enhancing visual grounding for complex attribute rich text&#10;queries encountered in robotic grasping. Visual grounding associates an object&#10;in 2D/3D space with natural language input and is studied in two scenarios:&#10;Closed and Open Vocabulary. HiFi&#45;CS features a lightweight decoder combined&#10;with a frozen VLM and outperforms competitive baselines in closed vocabulary&#10;settings while being 100x smaller in size. Our model can effectively guide&#10;open&#45;set object detectors like GroundedSAM to enhance open&#45;vocabulary&#10;performance. We validate our approach through real&#45;world RGS experiments using&#10;a 7&#45;DOF robotic arm, achieving 90.33% visual grounding accuracy in 15 tabletop&#10;scenes.

Papoutsis, I. E. Papadakis, C. Panagiotou, M. Dovčiak, E. Kammoun | &#160;&#160;Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to be variable across all&#10;wavelengths. Significant observational efforts have been invested in the last&#10;decade in studying their ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability. Long and&#10;densely sampled, multi&#45;wavelength monitoring campaigns of numerous Seyfert&#10;galaxies have been conducted with the aim of determining the X&#45;ray/UV/optical&#10;continuum time lags. Time&#45;lag studies can be used to constrain theoretical&#10;models. The observed time lags can be explained by thermal reprocessing of the&#10;X&#45;rays illuminating the accretion disc (known as the X&#45;ray reverberation&#10;model). However, the observed light curves contain more information that can be&#10;used to further constrain physical models. Our primary objective is to&#10;investigate whether, in addition to time lags, the X&#45;ray reverberation model&#10;can also explain the UV/optical variability amplitude of nearby Seyferts. To do&#10;this, we measured the excess variance of four sources (namely Mrk 509, NGC&#10;4151, NGC 2617, and Mrk 142) as a function of wavelength using data from&#10;archival long, multi&#45;wavelength campaigns with Swift, and ground&#45;based&#10;telescopes. We also computed the model excess variance in the case of the X&#45;ray&#10;reverberation model by determining the disc&#39;s transfer function and assuming a&#10;bending power law for the X&#45;ray power spectrum. We tested the validity of the&#10;model by comparing the measured and model variances for a range of accretion&#10;rates and X&#45;ray source heights. We conclude that the X&#45;ray thermal&#10;reverberation model can fit both the continuum, UV/optical time lags, as well&#10;as the variance in these AGNs, for the same physical parameters. Our results&#10;suggest that the accretion disc is constant and that all the observed&#10;UV/optical variations, on timescales of days and up to a few weeks, can be&#10;fully explained by the variable X&#45;rays as they illuminate the accretion disc.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10417v1) |&#10;| Local central limit theorem for Mallows measure | Alexey Bufetov, Kailun Chen | &#160;&#160;We study the statistics of the Mallows measure on permutations in the limit&#10;pioneered by Starr (2009).

However, this convenience raises substantial concerns about&#10;unauthorized access to users&#39; privacy&#45;sensitive information, which could be&#10;further abused for illegitimate purposes like user tracking or monetization.&#10;Our study offers a targeted analysis of user privacy protection among Android&#10;third&#45;party SDKs, filling a critical gap in the Android software supply chain.&#10;It focuses on two aspects of their privacy practices, including data&#10;exfiltration and behavior&#45;policy compliance (or privacy compliance), utilizing&#10;techniques of taint analysis and large language models. It covers 158&#10;widely&#45;used SDKs from two key SDK release platforms, the official one and a&#10;large alternative one. From them, we identified 338 instances of privacy data&#10;exfiltration. On the privacy compliance, our study reveals that more than 30%&#10;of the examined SDKs fail to provide a privacy policy to disclose their data&#10;handling practices. Among those that provide privacy policies, 37% of them&#10;over&#45;collect user data, and 88% falsely claim access to sensitive data. We&#10;revisit the latest versions of the SDKs after 12 months.

As raw traces obscure the true temporal structure of neuron&#39;s&#10;activity, we performed a tuned filtering of the calcium concentration using two&#10;methods: a biophysical model and a kernel mapping. The former characterizes&#10;spike trains related to a particular triggering event, while the latter filters&#10;out the signal and refines the selection of the underlying neuronal response.&#10;Transitioning from traditional time series analysis to point process theory,&#10;the study explores spike&#45;time distance metrics and point pattern prototypes to&#10;describe repeated observations. We assume that the analyzed neuron&#39;s firing&#10;events, i.e. spike occurrences, are temporal point process events. In&#10;particular, the study aims to categorize 47 point patterns by depth, assuming&#10;the similarity of spike occurrences within specific depth categories. The&#10;results highlight the pivotal roles of depth and stimuli in discerning diverse&#10;temporal structures of neuron firing events, confirming the point process&#10;approach based on prototype analysis is largely useful in the classification of&#10;spike traces.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10409v1) |&#10;| Variational closures for composite homogenised fluid flows | Theo Diamantakis, Ruiao Hu | &#160;&#160;The Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport is a variational formulation of&#10;stochastic fluid dynamics introduced to model the effects of unresolved scales,&#10;whilst preserving the geometric structure of ideal fluid flows. In this work,&#10;we show that the SALT equations can arise from the decomposition of the fluid&#10;flow map into its mean and fluctuating components. The fluctuating component is&#10;realised as a prescribed stochastic diffeomorphism that introduces stochastic&#10;transport into the system and we construct it using homogenisation theory. The&#10;dynamics of the mean component are derived from a variational principle&#10;utilising particular forms of variations that preserve the composite structure&#10;of the flow. Using a new variational principle, we show that SALT equations can&#10;arise from random Lagrangians and are equivalent to random coefficient PDEs. We&#10;also demonstrate how to modify the composite flow and the associated&#10;variational principle to derive models inspired by the Lagrangian Averaged&#10;Euler&#45;Poincare (LAEP) theory.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10408v1) |&#10;| Bitcoin Transaction Behavior Modeling Based on Balance Data | Yu Zhang, Claudio Tessone | &#160;&#160;When analyzing Bitcoin users&#39; balance distribution, we observed that it&#10;follows a log&#45;normal pattern. Drawing parallels from the successful application&#10;of Gibrat&#39;s law of proportional growth in explaining city size and word&#10;frequency distributions, we tested whether the same principle could account for&#10;the log&#45;normal distribution in Bitcoin balances. However, our calculations&#10;revealed that the exponent parameters in both the drift and variance terms&#10;deviate slightly from one. This suggests that Gibrat&#39;s proportional growth rule&#10;alone does not fully explain the log&#45;normal distribution observed in Bitcoin&#10;users&#39; balances. During our exploration, we discovered an intriguing&#10;phenomenon: Bitcoin users tend to fall into two distinct categories based on&#10;their behavior, which we refer to as ``poor&quot; and ``wealthy&quot; users. Poor users,&#10;who initially purchase only a small amount of Bitcoin, tend to buy more&#10;bitcoins first and then sell out all their holdings gradually over time. The&#10;certainty of selling all their coins is higher and higher with time. In&#10;contrast, wealthy users, who acquire a large amount of Bitcoin from the start,&#10;tend to sell off their holdings over time. The speed at which they sell their&#10;bitcoins is lower and lower over time and they will hold at least a small part&#10;of their initial holdings at last. Interestingly, the wealthier the user, the&#10;larger the proportion of their balance and the higher the certainty they tend&#10;to sell. This research provided an interesting perspective to explore bitcoin&#10;users&#39; behaviors which may apply to other finance markets.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10407v1) |&#10;| Stochastic Data&#45;Driven Predictive Control: Chance&#45;Constraint&#10; &#160;Satisfaction with Identified Multi&#45;step Predictors | Haldun Balim, Andrea Carron, Melanie N. Zeilinger, Johannes Köhler | &#160;&#160;We propose a novel data&#45;driven stochastic model predictive control framework&#10;for uncertain linear systems with noisy output measurements. Our approach&#10;leverages multi&#45;step predictors to efficiently propagate uncertainty, ensuring&#10;chance constraint satisfaction with minimal conservatism. In particular, we&#10;present a strategy to identify multi&#45;step predictors and quantify the&#10;associated uncertainty using a surrogate (data&#45;driven) state space model. Then,&#10;we utilize the derived distribution to formulate a constraint tightening that&#10;ensures chance constraint satisfaction. A numerical example highlights the&#10;reduced conservatism of handling parametric uncertainty in the proposed method&#10;compared to state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art solutions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10405v1) |&#10;| A Knowledge&#45;Enhanced Disease Diagnosis Method Based on Prompt Learning&#10; &#160;and BERT Integration | Zhang Zheng | &#160;&#160;This paper proposes a knowledge&#45;enhanced disease diagnosis method based on a&#10;prompt learning framework. The method retrieves structured knowledge from&#10;external knowledge graphs related to clinical cases, encodes it, and injects it&#10;into the prompt templates to enhance the language model&#39;s understanding and&#10;reasoning capabilities for the task.We conducted experiments on three public&#10;datasets: CHIP&#45;CTC, IMCS&#45;V2&#45;NER, and KUAKE&#45;QTR. The results show that the&#10;proposed method significantly outperforms existing models across multiple&#10;evaluation metrics, with an F1 score improvement of 2.4% on the CHIP&#45;CTC&#10;dataset, 3.1% on the IMCS&#45;V2&#45;NER dataset,and 4.2% on the KUAKE&#45;QTR dataset.&#10;Additionally,ablation studies confirmed the critical role of the knowledge&#10;injection module,as the removal of this module resulted in a significant drop&#10;in F1 score. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not&#10;only effectively improves the accuracy of disease diagnosis but also enhances&#10;the interpretability of the predictions, providing more reliable support and&#10;evidence for clinical diagnosis.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10403v1) |&#10;| A Statistical Equilibrium Approach to Adam Smith&#39;s Labor Theory of Value | Ellis Scharfenaker, Bruno Theodosio, Duncan K. Foley | &#160;&#160;Adam Smith&#39;s inquiry into the emergence and stability of the&#10;self&#45;organization of the division of labor in commodity production and exchange&#10;is considered using statistical equilibrium methods from statistical physics.&#10;We develop a statistical equilibrium model of the distribution of independent&#10;direct producers in a hub&#45;and&#45;spoke framework that predicts both the center of&#10;gravity of producers across lines of production as well as the endogenous&#10;fluctuations between lines of production that arise from Smith&#39;s concept of&#10;&quot;perfect liberty&quot;. The ergodic distribution of producers implies a long&#45;run&#10;balancing of &quot;advantages to disadvantages&quot; across lines of employment and&#10;gravitation of market prices around Smith&#39;s natural prices.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10402v1) |&#10;| Hydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning in meiosis II&#10; &#160;oocytes | Weida Liao, Eric Lauga | &#160;&#160;Cytoplasmic streaming, the persistent flow of fluid inside a cell, induces&#10;intracellular transport, which plays a key role in fundamental biological&#10;processes. In meiosis II mouse oocytes (developing egg cells) awaiting&#10;fertilisation, the spindle, which is the protein structure responsible for&#10;dividing genetic material in a cell, must maintain its position near the cell&#10;cortex (the thin actin network bound to the cell membrane) for many hours.&#10;However, the cytoplasmic streaming that accompanies this stable positioning&#10;would intuitively appear to destabilise the spindle position. Here, through a&#10;combination of numerical and analytical modelling, we reveal a new,&#10;hydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning beneath the cortical cap.&#10;We show that this stability depends critically on the spindle size and the&#10;active driving from the cortex, and demonstrate that stable spindle positioning&#10;can result purely from a hydrodynamic suction force exerted on the spindle by&#10;the cytoplasmic flow. Our findings show that local fluid dynamic forces can be&#10;sufficient to stabilise the spindle, explaining robustness against&#10;perturbations not only perpendicular but also parallel to the cortex. Our&#10;results shed light on the importance of cytoplasmic streaming in mammalian&#10;meiosis.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10401v1) |&#10;| Sherpa: An Open Source Python Fitting Package | Aneta Siemiginowska, Douglas Burke, Hans Moritz Günther, Nicholas P.

Dejrah | &#160;&#160;We focus on the inflationary predictions of $beta$&#45;exponential potential&#10;models, in which the inflaton is a representation of the field delineating the&#10;size of extra&#45;dimension. Since it offers a well&#45;motivated starting point for&#10;the study of physics at very high energies, we incorporate an $R^2$ term in the&#10;Palatini gravity. In addition, afterward the inflation, the inflaton oscillates&#10;about the minimum of the inflation potential, and reheats the universe. This&#10;occurs during the reheating phase, at which the inflaton decays into the&#10;standard model particles, which fill the universe. We extend our examination by&#10;considering the reheating effects on inflationary observables by employing the&#10;different scenarios of the reheat temperature. Supposing the standard thermal&#10;history after inflation, we display the inflationary predictions, $n_s, r,&#10;mathrm{d}n_s/mathrm{d}&#10;n k$ of $beta$&#45;exponential potential with minimal&#10;coupling in Palatini $R^2$ gravity. Also, different kinds of constraints from a&#10;variety of observations, such as BICEP/Keck, Planck 2018, as well as future&#10;possible detectable sensitivities that might be reached by CMB experiments:&#10;CMB&#45;S4 and LiteBIRD are taken into account in this work. We indicate that our&#10;results are consistent with both the latest data and the future sensitivity&#10;forecasts of LiteBIRD/Planck and CMB&#45;S4. Finally, the results in this study&#10;highlight the viability of our model even in the case of the existence of more&#10;stringent constraints expected from future achievable confidence level limits.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10398v1) |&#10;| Quantifying Observational Projection Effects with a Simulation&#45;based hot&#10; &#160;CGM model | Soumya Shreeram, Johan Comparat, Andrea Merloni, Yi Zhang, Gabriele Ponti, Kirpal Nandra, John ZuHone, Ilaria Marini, Stephan Vladutescu&#45;Zopp, Paola Popesso, Ruediger Pakmor, Riccardo Seppi, Celine Peroux, Daniele Sorini | &#160;&#160;The hot phase of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) allows us to probe the&#10;inflow and outflow of gas within a galaxy, which is responsible for dictating&#10;the evolution of the galaxy. Studying the hot CGM sheds light on a better&#10;understanding of gas physics, which is crucial to inform and constrain&#10;simulation models. With the recent advances in observational measurements&#10;probing the hot CGM in X&#45;rays and tSZ, we have a new avenue for widening our&#10;knowledge of gas physics and feedback by exploiting the information from&#10;current/future observations. In this paper, we use the TNG300 hydrodynamical&#10;simulations to build a fully self&#45;consistent forward model for the hot CGM. We&#10;construct a lightcone and generate mock X&#45;ray observations. We quantify the&#10;projection effects, namely the locally correlated large&#45;scale structure in&#10;X&#45;rays and the effect due to satellite galaxies misclassified as centrals which&#10;affects the measured hot CGM galactocentric profiles in stacking experiments.&#10;We present an analytical model that describes the intrinsic X&#45;ray surface&#10;brightness profile across the stellar and halo mass bins. The increasing&#10;stellar mass bins result in decreasing values of $beta$, the exponent&#10;quantifying the slope of the intrinsic galactocentric profiles. We carry&#10;forward the current state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art by also showing the impact of the locally&#10;correlated environment on the measured X&#45;ray surface brightness profiles. We&#10;also present, for the first time, the effect of misclassified centrals in&#10;stacking experiments for three stellar mass bins: $10^{10.5&#45;11} M_odot$,&#10;$10^{11&#45;11.2} M_odot$, and $10^{11.2&#45;11.5} M_odot$. We find that the&#10;contaminating effect of the misclassified centrals on the stacked profiles&#10;increases when the stellar mass decreases.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10397v1) |&#10;| MOST: MR reconstruction Optimization for multiple downStream Tasks via&#10; &#160;continual learning | Hwihun Jeong, Se Young Chun, Jongho Lee | &#160;&#160;Deep learning&#45;based Magnetic Resonance (MR) reconstruction methods have&#10;focused on generating high&#45;quality images but they often overlook the impact on&#10;downstream tasks (e.g., segmentation) that utilize the reconstructed images.&#10;Cascading separately trained reconstruction network and downstream task network&#10;has been shown to introduce performance degradation due to error propagation&#10;and domain gaps between training datasets. To mitigate this issue, downstream&#10;task&#45;oriented reconstruction optimization has been proposed for a single&#10;downstream task. Expanding this optimization to multi&#45;task scenarios is not&#10;straightforward. In this work, we extended this optimization to sequentially&#10;introduced multiple downstream tasks and demonstrated that a single MR&#10;reconstruction network can be optimized for multiple downstream tasks by&#10;deploying continual learning (MOST). MOST integrated techniques from&#10;replay&#45;based continual learning and image&#45;guided loss to overcome catastrophic&#10;forgetting. Comparative experiments demonstrated that MOST outperformed a&#10;reconstruction network without finetuning, a reconstruction network with&#10;na&quot;ive finetuning, and conventional continual learning methods. This&#10;advancement empowers the application of a single MR reconstruction network for&#10;multiple downstream tasks.

In particular, we analyse the task of&#10;textit{multicopy state teleportation}, where Alice has $k$ identical copies of&#10;an arbitrary unknown $d$&#45;dimensional qudit state $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to teleport&#10;a single copy of $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to Bob using a maximally entangled&#10;two&#45;qudit state shared between Alice and Bob without Bob&#39;s correction. Alice&#10;may perform a joint measurement on her half of the entangled state and the $k$&#10;copies of $vertpsi&#13;angle$. We prove that the maximal probability of success&#10;for teleporting the exact state $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to Bob is&#10;$p(d,k)=frac{k}{d(k&#45;1+d)}$ and present an explicit protocol to attain this&#10;performance. Then, by utilising $k$ copies of an arbitrary target state&#10;$vertpsi&#13;angle$, we show how the multicopy state teleportation protocol can&#10;be employed to enhance the success probability of storage and retrieval of&#10;quantum programs, which aims to universally retrieve the action of an arbitrary&#10;quantum channel that is stored in a state. Our proofs make use of group&#10;representation theory methods, which may find applications beyond the problems&#10;addressed in this work.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10393v1) |&#10;| TPFL: Tsetlin&#45;Personalized Federated Learning with Confidence&#45;Based&#10; &#160;Clustering | Rasoul Jafari Gohari, Laya Aliahmadipour, Ezat Valipour | &#160;&#160;The world of Machine Learning (ML) has witnessed rapid changes in terms of&#10;new models and ways to process users data. The majority of work that has been&#10;done is focused on Deep Learning (DL) based approaches. However, with the&#10;emergence of new algorithms such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm, there&#10;is growing interest in exploring alternative approaches that may offer unique&#10;advantages in certain domains or applications. One of these domains is&#10;Federated Learning (FL), in which users privacy is of utmost importance. Due to&#10;its novelty, FL has seen a surge in the incorporation of personalization&#10;techniques to enhance model accuracy while maintaining user privacy under&#10;personalized conditions. In this work, we propose a novel approach dubbed TPFL:&#10;Tsetlin&#45;Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into&#10;clusters based on their confidence towards a specific class. In this way,&#10;clustering can benefit from two key advantages. Firstly, clients share only&#10;what they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight&#10;aggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been&#10;enough during the training. This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are&#10;non&#45;Independent and Identically Distributed (non&#45;IID). Secondly, by sharing&#10;only weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially&#10;reduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication&#10;cost. The results of TPFL demonstrated the highest accuracy on three different&#10;datasets; namely MNIST, FashionMNIST and FEMNIST.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10392v1) |&#10;| Prompt&#45;and&#45;Transfer: Dynamic Class&#45;aware Enhancement for Few&#45;shot&#10; &#160;Segmentation | Hanbo Bi, Yingchao Feng, Wenhui Diao, Peijin Wang, Yongqiang Mao, Kun Fu, Hongqi Wang, Xian Sun | &#160;&#160;For more efficient generalization to unseen domains (classes), most Few&#45;shot&#10;Segmentation (FSS) would directly exploit pre&#45;trained encoders and only&#10;fine&#45;tune the decoder, especially in the current era of large models. However,&#10;such fixed feature encoders tend to be class&#45;agnostic, inevitably activating&#10;objects that are irrelevant to the target class. In contrast, humans can&#10;effortlessly focus on specific objects in the line of sight. This paper mimics&#10;the visual perception pattern of human beings and proposes a novel and powerful&#10;prompt&#45;driven scheme, called ``Prompt and Transfer&quot; (PAT), which constructs a&#10;dynamic class&#45;aware prompting paradigm to tune the encoder for focusing on the&#10;interested object (target class) in the current task. Three key points are&#10;elaborated to enhance the prompting: 1) Cross&#45;modal linguistic information is&#10;introduced to initialize prompts for each task. 2) Semantic Prompt Transfer&#10;(SPT) that precisely transfers the class&#45;specific semantics within the images&#10;to prompts. 3) Part Mask Generator (PMG) that works in conjunction with SPT to&#10;adaptively generate different but complementary part prompts for different&#10;individuals. Surprisingly, PAT achieves competitive performance on 4 different&#10;tasks including standard FSS, Cross&#45;domain FSS (e.g., CV, medical, and remote&#10;sensing domains), Weak&#45;label FSS, and Zero&#45;shot Segmentation, setting new&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;arts on 11 benchmarks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10389v1) |&#10;| Revising the Structure of Recurrent Neural Networks to Eliminate&#10; &#160;Numerical Derivatives in Forming Physics Informed Loss Terms with Respect to&#10; &#160;Time | Mahyar Jahani&#45;nasab, Mohamad Ali Bijarchi | &#160;&#160;Solving unsteady partial differential equations (PDEs) using recurrent neural&#10;networks (RNNs) typically requires numerical derivatives between each block of&#10;the RNN to form the physics informed loss function. However, this introduces&#10;the complexities of numerical derivatives into the training process of these&#10;models. In this study, we propose modifying the structure of the traditional&#10;RNN to enable the prediction of each block over a time interval, making it&#10;possible to calculate the derivative of the output with respect to time using&#10;the backpropagation algorithm. To achieve this, the time intervals of these&#10;blocks are overlapped, defining a mutual loss function between them.&#10;Additionally, the employment of conditional hidden states enables us to achieve&#10;a unique solution for each block. The forget factor is utilized to control the&#10;influence of the conditional hidden state on the prediction of the subsequent&#10;block. This new model, termed the Mutual Interval RNN (MI&#45;RNN), is applied to&#10;solve three different benchmarks: the Burgers equation, unsteady heat&#10;conduction in an irregular domain, and the Green vortex problem. Our results&#10;demonstrate that MI&#45;RNN can find the exact solution more accurately compared to&#10;existing RNN models. For instance, in the second problem, MI&#45;RNN achieved one&#10;order of magnitude less relative error compared to the RNN model with numerical&#10;derivatives.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10388v1) |&#10;| Sharp decay rate for eigenfunctions of perturbed periodic Schrödinger&#10; &#160;operators | Wencai Liu, Rodrigo Matos, John N.

Specifically, we consider operators&#10;of the form $H = &#45;Delta + V + v$, where $Delta$ is the discrete Laplacian,&#10;$V: mathbb{Z}^d &#13;ightarrow mathbb{R}$ is a periodic potential, and $v:&#10;mathbb{Z}^d &#13;ightarrow mathbb{C}$ represents a decaying impurity.

Key applications include the absence of embedded eigenvalues for&#10;operators with impurities decaying faster than any exponential function and the&#10;determination of sharp decay rates for eigenfunctions. Our findings extend&#10;previous works by providing precise decay conditions for impurities and&#10;analyzing different spectral regimes of $&#10;ambda$.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10387v1) |&#10;| Mamba&#45;ST: State Space Model for Efficient Style Transfer | Filippo Botti, Alex Ergasti, Leonardo Rossi, Tomaso Fontanini, Claudio Ferrari, Massimo Bertozzi, Andrea Prati | &#160;&#160;The goal of style transfer is, given a content image and a style source,&#10;generating a new image preserving the content but with the artistic&#10;representation of the style source. Most of the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art architectures&#10;use transformers or diffusion&#45;based models to perform this task, despite the&#10;heavy computational burden that they require. In particular, transformers use&#10;self&#45; and cross&#45;attention layers which have large memory footprint, while&#10;diffusion models require high inference time. To overcome the above, this paper&#10;explores a novel design of Mamba, an emergent State&#45;Space Model (SSM), called&#10;Mamba&#45;ST, to perform style transfer. To do so, we adapt Mamba linear equation&#10;to simulate the behavior of cross&#45;attention layers, which are able to combine&#10;two separate embeddings into a single output, but drastically reducing memory&#10;usage and time complexity. We modified the Mamba&#39;s inner equations so to accept&#10;inputs from, and combine, two separate data streams. To the best of our&#10;knowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt the equations of SSMs to a vision&#10;task like style transfer without requiring any other module like&#10;cross&#45;attention or custom normalization layers. An extensive set of experiments&#10;demonstrates the superiority and efficiency of our method in performing style&#10;transfer compared to transformers and diffusion models.

This module employs the Z4c formulation to solve the Einstein&#10;equations. We demonstrate its accuracy through a series of standard numerical&#10;relativity tests, including convergence of the gravitational waveform from&#10;binary black hole coalescence.

Additionally, we observe a&#10;significant performance boost, with two orders of magnitude speedup ($gtrsim&#10;200times$) on a GPU compared to a single CPU core, affirming that AthenaK is&#10;well&#45;suited for exascale computing, thereby expanding the potential for&#10;breakthroughs in numerical relativity research.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10383v1) |&#10;| J&#45;UBIK: The JAX&#45;accelerated Universal Bayesian Imaging Kit | Vincent Eberle, Matteo Guardiani, Margret Westerkamp, Philipp Frank, Julian Rüstig, Julia Stadler, Torsten A. Enßlin | &#160;&#160;Many advances in astronomy and astrophysics originate from accurate images of&#10;the sky emission across multiple wavelengths. This often requires&#10;reconstructing spatially and spectrally correlated signals detected from&#10;multiple instruments. To facilitate the high&#45;fidelity imaging of these signals,&#10;we introduce the universal Bayesian imaging kit (UBIK). Specifically, we&#10;present J&#45;UBIK, a flexible and modular implementation leveraging the&#10;JAX&#45;accelerated NIFTy.re software as its backend. J&#45;UBIK streamlines the&#10;implementation of the key Bayesian inference components, providing for all the&#10;necessary steps of Bayesian imaging pipelines. First, it provides adaptable&#10;prior models for different sky realizations. Second, it includes likelihood&#10;models tailored to specific instruments. So far, the package includes three&#10;instruments: Chandra and eROSITA for X&#45;ray observations, and the James Webb&#10;Space Telescope (JWST) for the near&#45; and mid&#45;infrared. The aim is to expand&#10;this set in the future. Third, these models can be integrated with various&#10;inference and optimization schemes, such as maximum a posteriori estimation and&#10;variational inference. Explicit demos show how to integrate the individual&#10;modules into a full analysis pipeline.

Biswas, Sudin Ganguly, Chunlei Qu, Santanu K. Maiti | &#160;&#160;We present a comprehensive study on enhancing the thermoelectric (TE)&#10;performance of bilayer graphene (BLG) through irradiation with arbitrarily&#10;polarized light, focusing on $AA$&#45; and $AB$&#45;stacked configurations with zigzag&#10;edges. Utilizing a combination of tight&#45;binding theory and density functional&#10;theory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on&#10;electronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the&#10;electronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function,&#10;which significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the&#10;overall {it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT&#10;calculations reveal that $AB$&#45;stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal&#10;conductivity compared to $AA$&#45;stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic&#10;scattering and phonon group velocity. The combined analysis shows that FOM&#10;exceeds unity in both stacking types, with notable improvements near the&#10;irradiation&#45;induced gap. Additionally, we explore the dependence of FOM on the&#10;system dimensions and temperature, demonstrating that light&#45;irradiated BLG&#10;holds great promise for efficient thermoelectric energy conversion and waste&#10;heat recovery. Our results show favorable responses over a wide range of&#10;irradiation parameters. These findings provide crucial insights into optimizing&#10;BLG for advanced TE applications through light&#45;induced modifications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10380v1) |&#10;| Leveraging Joint Spectral and Spatial Learning with MAMBA for&#10; &#160;Multichannel Speech Enhancement | Wenze Ren, Haibin Wu, Yi&#45;Cheng Lin, Xuanjun Chen, Rong Chao, Kuo&#45;Hsuan Hung, You&#45;Jin Li, Wen&#45;Yuan Ting, Hsin&#45;Min Wang, Yu Tsao | &#160;&#160;In multichannel speech enhancement, effectively capturing spatial and&#10;spectral information across different microphones is crucial for noise&#10;reduction. Traditional methods, such as CNN or LSTM, attempt to model the&#10;temporal dynamics of full&#45;band and sub&#45;band spectral and spatial features.&#10;However, these approaches face limitations in fully modeling complex temporal&#10;dependencies, especially in dynamic acoustic environments. To overcome these&#10;challenges, we modify the current advanced model McNet by introducing an&#10;improved version of Mamba, a state&#45;space model, and further propose MCMamba.&#10;MCMamba has been completely reengineered to integrate full&#45;band and narrow&#45;band&#10;spatial information with sub&#45;band and full&#45;band spectral features, providing a&#10;more comprehensive approach to modeling spatial and spectral information. Our&#10;experimental results demonstrate that MCMamba significantly improves the&#10;modeling of spatial and spectral features in multichannel speech enhancement,&#10;outperforming McNet and achieving state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art performance on the CHiME&#45;3&#10;dataset. Additionally, we find that Mamba performs exceptionally well in&#10;modeling spectral information.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10376v1) |&#10;| Nonlinear Causality in Brain Networks: With Application to Motor Imagery&#10; &#160;vs Execution | Sipan Aslan, Hernando Ombao | &#160;&#160;One fundamental challenge of data&#45;driven analysis in neuroscience is modeling&#10;causal interactions and exploring the connectivity of nodes in a brain network.&#10;Various statistical methods, relying on various perspectives and employing&#10;different data modalities, are being developed to examine and comprehend the&#10;underlying causal structures inherent to brain dynamics. This study introduces&#10;a novel statistical approach, TAR4C, to dissect causal interactions in&#10;multichannel EEG recordings. TAR4C uses the threshold autoregressive model to&#10;describe the causal interaction between nodes or clusters of nodes in a brain&#10;network. The perspective involves testing whether one node, which may represent&#10;a brain region, can control the dynamics of the other. The node that has such&#10;an impact on the other is called a threshold variable and can be classified as&#10;a causative because its functionality is the leading source operating as an&#10;instantaneous switching mechanism that regulates the time&#45;varying&#10;autoregressive structure of the other. This statistical concept is commonly&#10;referred to as threshold non&#45;linearity. Once threshold non&#45;linearity has been&#10;verified between a pair of nodes, the subsequent essential facet of TAR&#10;modeling is to assess the predictive ability of the causal node for the current&#10;activity on the other and represent causal interactions in autoregressive&#10;terms. This predictive ability is what underlies Granger causality. The TAR4C&#10;approach can discover non&#45;linear and time&#45;dependent causal interactions without&#10;negating the G&#45;causality perspective. The efficacy of the proposed approach is&#10;exemplified by analyzing the EEG signals recorded during the motor&#10;movement/imagery experiment. The similarities and differences between the&#10;causal interactions manifesting during the execution and the imagery of a given&#10;motor movement are demonstrated by analyzing EEG recordings from multiple&#10;subjects.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10374v1) |&#10;| Instigating Cooperation among LLM Agents Using Adaptive Information&#10; &#160;Modulation | Qiliang Chen, &#160;Alireza, &#160;Ilami, Nunzio Lore, Babak Heydari | &#160;&#160;This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for&#10;human strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these&#10;agents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments. Our&#10;approach extends traditional agent&#45;based simulations by using strategic LLM&#10;agents (SLA) and introducing dynamic and adaptive governance through a&#10;pro&#45;social promoting RL agent (PPA) that modulates information access across&#10;agents in a network, optimizing social welfare and promoting pro&#45;social&#10;behavior. Through validation in iterative games, including the prisoner&#10;dilemma, we demonstrate that SLA agents exhibit nuanced strategic adaptations.&#10;The PPA agent effectively learns to adjust information transparency, resulting&#10;in enhanced cooperation rates. This framework offers significant insights into&#10;AI&#45;mediated social dynamics, contributing to the deployment of AI in real&#45;world&#10;team settings.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10372v1) |&#10;| Learning Gentle Grasping from Human&#45;Free Force Control Demonstration | Mingxuan Li, Lunwei Zhang, Tiemin Li, Yao Jiang | &#160;&#160;Humans can steadily and gently grasp unfamiliar objects based on tactile&#10;perception. Robots still face challenges in achieving similar performance due&#10;to the difficulty of learning accurate grasp&#45;force predictions and force&#10;control strategies that can be generalized from limited data. In this article,&#10;we propose an approach for learning grasping from ideal force control&#10;demonstrations, to achieve similar performance of human hands with limited data&#10;size. Our approach utilizes objects with known contact characteristics to&#10;automatically generate reference force curves without human demonstrations. In&#10;addition, we design the dual convolutional neural networks (Dual&#45;CNN)&#10;architecture which incorporating a physics&#45;based mechanics module for learning&#10;target grasping force predictions from demonstrations. The described method can&#10;be effectively applied in vision&#45;based tactile sensors and enables gentle and&#10;stable grasping of objects from the ground. The described prediction model and&#10;grasping strategy were validated in offline evaluations and online experiments,&#10;and the accuracy and generalizability were demonstrated.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10371v1) |&#10;| Uncovering the Mechanism of Hepatotoxiciy of PFAS Targeting L&#45;FABP Using&#10; &#160;GCN and Computational Modeling | Lucas Jividen, Tibo Duran, Xi&#45;Zhi Niu, Jun Bai | &#160;&#160;Per&#45; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental&#10;pollutants with known toxicity and bioaccumulation issues. Their widespread&#10;industrial use and resistance to degradation have led to global environmental&#10;contamination and significant health concerns. While a minority of PFAS have&#10;been extensively studied, the toxicity of many PFAS remains poorly understood&#10;due to limited direct toxicological data. This study advances the predictive&#10;modeling of PFAS toxicity by combining semi&#45;supervised graph convolutional&#10;networks (GCNs) with molecular descriptors and fingerprints. We propose a novel&#10;approach to enhance the prediction of PFAS binding affinities by isolating&#10;molecular fingerprints to construct graphs where then descriptors are set as&#10;the node features. This approach specifically captures the structural,&#10;physicochemical, and topological features of PFAS without overfitting due to an&#10;abundance of features. Unsupervised clustering then identifies representative&#10;compounds for detailed binding studies. Our results provide a more accurate&#10;ability to estimate PFAS hepatotoxicity to provide guidance in chemical&#10;discovery of new PFAS and the development of new safety regulations.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10370v1) |&#10;| Stochastic Control of UAVs: An Optimal Tradeoff between Performance,&#10; &#160;Flight Smoothness and Control Effort | George Rapakoulias, Panagiotis Tsiotras | &#160;&#160;Safe and accurate control of unmanned aerial vehicles in the presence of&#10;winds is a challenging control problem due to the hard&#45;to&#45;model and highly&#10;stochastic nature of the disturbance forces acting upon the vehicle. To meet&#10;performance constraints, state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art control methods such as Incremental&#10;Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) or other adaptive control techniques require&#10;high control gains to mitigate the effects of uncertainty entering the system.&#10;While achieving good tracking performance, IDNI requires excessive control&#10;effort, results in high actuator strain, and reduced flight smoothness due to&#10;constant and aggressive corrective actions commanded by the controller. In this&#10;paper, we propose a novel control architecture that allows the user to&#10;systematically address the trade&#45;off between high authority control and&#10;performance constraint satisfaction. Our approach consists of two parts. To&#10;cancel out biases introduced by unmodelled aerodynamic effects we propose a&#10;hybrid, model&#45;based disturbance force estimator augmented with a neural&#10;network, that can adapt to external wind conditions using a Kalman Filter. We&#10;then utilize state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art results from Covariance Steering theory, which&#10;offers a principled way of controlling the uncertainty of the tracking error&#10;dynamics. We first analyze the properties of the combined system and then&#10;provide extensive experimental results to verify the advantages of the proposed&#10;approach over existing methods&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10369v1) |&#10;| Integrated nowcasting of convective precipitation with Transformer&#45;based&#10; &#160;models using multi&#45;source data | Çağlar Küçük, Aitor Atencia, Markus Dabernig | &#160;&#160;Precipitation nowcasting is crucial for mitigating the impacts of severe&#10;weather events and supporting daily activities. Conventional models&#10;predominantly relying on radar data have limited performance in predicting&#10;cases with complex temporal features such as convection initiation,&#10;highlighting the need to integrate data from other sources for more&#10;comprehensive nowcasting. Unlike physics&#45;based models, machine learning&#10;(ML)&#45;based models offer promising solutions for efficiently integrating large&#10;volumes of diverse data. We present EF4INCA, a spatiotemporal Transformer model&#10;for precipitation nowcasting that integrates satellite&#45; and ground&#45;based&#10;observations with numerical weather prediction outputs. EF4INCA provides&#10;high&#45;resolution forecasts over Austria, accurately predicting the location and&#10;shape of precipitation fields with a spatial resolution of 1 kilometre and a&#10;temporal resolution of 5 minutes, up to 90 minutes ahead. Our evaluation shows&#10;that EF4INCA outperforms conventional nowcasting models, including the&#10;operational model of Austria, particularly in scenarios with complex temporal&#10;features such as convective initiation and rapid weather changes. EF4INCA&#10;maintains higher accuracy in location forecasting but generates smoother fields&#10;at later prediction times compared to traditional models. Interpretation of our&#10;model showed that precipitation products and SEVIRI infrared channels CH7 and&#10;CH9 are the most important data streams. These results underscore the&#10;importance of combining data from different domains, including physics&#45;based&#10;model products, with ML approaches. Our study highlights the robustness of&#10;EF4INCA and its potential for improved precipitation nowcasting. We provide&#10;access to our code repository, model weights, and the dataset curated for&#10;benchmarking, facilitating further development and application.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10367v1) |&#10;&#10;">

Hill, Matthias Kluge, Martin Landriau, Ximena Mazzalay, Eva Noyola, Taniya Parikh, Jan Snigula | &#160;&#160;We analyse the stellar structure of a sample of dwarf ellipticals (dE)&#10;inhabiting various environments within the Virgo cluster. Integral&#45;field&#10;observations with a high spectral resolution allow us to robustly determine&#10;their low velocity dispersions ($sim25$ km s$^{&#45;1}$) and higher&#45;order&#10;kinematic moments out to the half&#45;light radius. We find the dEs exhibit a&#10;diversity in ages with the younger dEs being less enhanced than the older,&#10;suggesting a complex star formation history for those dEs that recently entered&#10;Virgo while others have been quenched shortly after reionization.&#10;Orbit&#45;superposition modeling allowed us to recover viewing angles, stellar&#10;mass&#45;to&#45;light ratios (with gradients), as well as the intrinsic orbit&#10;structure. We find that the angular momentum of the dEs is strongly suppressed&#10;compared to ordinary early&#45;type galaxies and correlates with the environment.&#10;Flattened dEs are so because of a suppressed kinetic energy perpendicular to&#10;their equatorial plane. Combining population and dynamical modeling results, we&#10;find an age&#45;dependent stellar initial mass function (IMF) or, alternatively,&#10;evidence for a more extended star formation history for those galaxies that&#10;have had higher initial mass and/or inhabited lower density environments. dEs&#10;appear to have a spatially homogeneous stellar structure but the state they&#10;were `frozen&#39; in as they stopped forming stars varies dramatically according to&#10;their initial conditions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10518v1) |&#10;| RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long&#45;Context LLM Inference via Vector&#10; &#160;Retrieval | Di Liu, Meng Chen, Baotong Lu, Huiqiang Jiang, Zhenhua Han, Qianxi Zhang, Qi Chen, Chengruidong Zhang, Bailu Ding, Kai Zhang, Chen Chen, Fan Yang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu | &#160;&#160;Transformer&#45;based large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly important&#10;in various domains. However, the quadratic time complexity of attention&#10;operation poses a significant challenge for scaling to longer contexts due to&#10;the extremely high inference latency and GPU memory consumption for caching&#10;key&#45;value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training&#45;free&#10;approach to accelerate attention computation. To leverage the dynamic sparse&#10;property of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor&#10;search (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most&#10;relevant ones via vector search during generation. Due to the&#10;out&#45;of&#45;distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors, off&#45;the&#45;shelf&#10;ANNS indexes still need to scan O(N) (usually 30% of all keys) data for&#10;accurate retrieval, which fails to exploit the high sparsity.&#10;RetrievalAttention first identifies the OOD challenge of ANNS&#45;based attention,&#10;and addresses it via an attention&#45;aware vector search algorithm that can adapt&#10;to queries and only access 1&#45;&#45;3% of data, thus achieving a sub&#45;linear time&#10;complexity. RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of&#10;long&#45;context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the&#10;model accuracy. Especially, RetrievalAttention only needs 16GB GPU memory for&#10;serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating&#10;one token in 0.188 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB).&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516v1) |&#10;| An Efficient Self&#45;Learning Framework For Interactive Spoken Dialog&#10; &#160;Systems | Hitesh Tulsiani, David M. Chan, Shalini Ghosh, Garima Lalwani, Prabhat Pandey, Ankish Bansal, Sri Garimella, Ariya Rastrow, Björn Hoffmeister | &#160;&#160;Dialog systems, such as voice assistants, are expected to engage with users&#10;in complex, evolving conversations. Unfortunately, traditional automatic speech&#10;recognition (ASR) systems deployed in such applications are usually trained to&#10;recognize each turn independently and lack the ability to adapt to the&#10;conversational context or incorporate user feedback. In this work, we introduce&#10;a general framework for ASR in dialog systems that can go beyond learning from&#10;single&#45;turn utterances and learn over time how to adapt to both explicit&#10;supervision and implicit user feedback present in multi&#45;turn conversations. We&#10;accomplish that by leveraging advances in student&#45;teacher learning and&#10;context&#45;aware dialog processing, and designing contrastive self&#45;supervision&#10;approaches with Ohm, a new online hard&#45;negative mining approach. We show that&#10;leveraging our new framework compared to traditional training leads to relative&#10;WER reductions of close to 10% in real&#45;world dialog systems, and up to 26% on&#10;public synthetic data.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10515v1) |&#10;| Constraints on axions from patchy screening of the cosmic microwave&#10; &#160;background | Samuel Goldstein, Fiona McCarthy, Cristina Mondino, J. Colin Hill, Junwu Huang, Matthew C.

Applying state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art foreground cleaning&#10;techniques to $textit{Planck}$ CMB observations, we construct maps of&#10;axion&#45;induced &quot;patchy screening&quot; of the CMB. We cross&#45;correlate these maps with&#10;data from the $textit{unWISE}$ galaxy survey and find no evidence of axions.&#10;We constrain the axion&#45;photon coupling, $g_{agammagamma} &#10;esssim 2 times&#10;10^{&#45;12}~{&#13;m GeV}^{&#45;1}$, at the 95% confidence level for axion masses in the&#10;range $10^{&#45;13}~{&#13;m eV} &#10;esssim m_a &#10;esssim 10^{&#45;12}~{&#13;m eV}$. These&#10;constraints are competitive with the tightest astrophysical axion limits in&#10;this mass range and are inferred from robust population&#45;level statistics, which&#10;makes them complementary to existing searches that rely on modeling of&#10;individual systems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10514v1) |&#10;| Weak Superimposed Codes of Improved Asymptotic Rate and Their Randomized&#10; &#160;Construction | Yu Tsunoda, Yuichiro Fujiwara | &#160;&#160;Weak superimposed codes are combinatorial structures related closely to&#10;generalized cover&#45;free families, superimposed codes, and disjunct matrices in&#10;that they are only required to satisfy similar but less stringent conditions.&#10;This class of codes may also be seen as a stricter variant of what are known as&#10;locally thin families in combinatorics. Originally, weak superimposed codes&#10;were introduced in the context of multimedia content protection against illegal&#10;distribution of copies under the assumption that a coalition of malicious users&#10;may employ the averaging attack with adversarial noise. As in many other kinds&#10;of codes in information theory, it is of interest and importance in the study&#10;of weak superimposed codes to find the highest achievable rate in the&#10;asymptotic regime and give an efficient construction that produces an infinite&#10;sequence of codes that achieve it. Here, we prove a tighter lower bound than&#10;the sharpest known one on the rate of optimal weak superimposed codes and give&#10;a polynomial&#45;time randomized construction algorithm for codes that&#10;asymptotically attain our improved bound with high probability.

We propose an LLM&#45;based translation&#10;scheme that improves the success rate of translating large&#45;scale C code into&#10;compilable Rust code. Our approach involves three key techniques: (1)&#10;pre&#45;processing the C code to better align its structure and expressions with&#10;Rust, (2) segmenting the code into optimally sized translation units to avoid&#10;exceeding the LLM&#39;s context window limits, and (3) iteratively compiling and&#10;repairing errors while maintaining consistency between translation units using&#10;context&#45;supplementing prompts. Compilation success is an essential first step&#10;in achieving functional equivalence, as only compilable code can be further&#10;tested. In experiments with 20 benchmark C programs, including those exceeding&#10;4 kilo lines of code, we successfully translated all programs into compilable&#10;Rust code without losing corresponding parts of the original code.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10506v1) |&#10;| Machine Learning Optimization of non&#45;Kasha Behavior and of Transient&#10; &#160;Dynamics in Model Retinal Isomerization | Davinder Singh, Chern Chuang, Paul Brumer | &#160;&#160;Designing a model of retinal isomerization in Rhodopsin, the first step in&#10;vision, that accounts for both experimental transient and stationary state&#10;observables is challenging. Here, multi&#45;objective Bayesian optimization is&#10;employed to refine the parameters of a minimal two&#45;state&#45;two&#45;mode (TM) model&#10;describing the photoisomerization of retinal in Rhodopsin. With an appropriate&#10;selection of objectives, the optimized retinal model predicts excitation&#10;wavelength&#45;dependent fluorescence spectra that closely align with&#10;experimentally observed non&#45;Kasha behavior in the non&#45;equilibrium steady state.&#10;Further, adjustments to the potential energy surface within the TM model reduce&#10;the discrepancies across the time domain. Overall, agreement with experimental&#10;data is excellent.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10505v1) |&#10;| DILA: Dictionary Label Attention for Mechanistic Interpretability in&#10; &#160;High&#45;dimensional Multi&#45;label Medical Coding Prediction | John Wu, David Wu, Jimeng Sun | &#160;&#160;Predicting high&#45;dimensional or extreme multilabels, such as in medical&#10;coding, requires both accuracy and interpretability. Existing works often rely&#10;on local interpretability methods, failing to provide comprehensive&#10;explanations of the overall mechanism behind each label prediction within a&#10;multilabel set. We propose a mechanistic interpretability module called&#10;DIctionary Label Attention (method) that disentangles uninterpretable dense&#10;embeddings into a sparse embedding space, where each nonzero element (a&#10;dictionary feature) represents a globally learned medical concept. Through&#10;human evaluations, we show that our sparse embeddings are more human&#10;understandable than its dense counterparts by at least 50 percent. Our&#10;automated dictionary feature identification pipeline, leveraging large language&#10;models (LLMs), uncovers thousands of learned medical concepts by examining and&#10;summarizing the highest activating tokens for each dictionary feature. We&#10;represent the relationships between dictionary features and medical codes&#10;through a sparse interpretable matrix, enhancing the mechanistic and global&#10;understanding of the model&#39;s predictions while maintaining competitive&#10;performance and scalability without extensive human annotation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10504v1) |&#10;| Causal Language Modeling Can Elicit Search and Reasoning Capabilities on&#10; &#160;Logic Puzzles | Kulin Shah, Nishanth Dikkala, Xin Wang, Rina Panigrahy | &#160;&#160;Causal language modeling using the Transformer architecture has yielded&#10;remarkable capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) over the last few&#10;years. However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning&#10;capabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this&#10;work, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as&#10;solving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to&#10;search over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then&#10;apply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the&#10;application of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in&#10;a cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases,&#10;multiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We&#10;observe that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn&#10;to solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21%$ of the puzzles fully correctly)&#10;when trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that&#10;training Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and&#10;without such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis&#10;to Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves&#10;$92.04 %$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal&#10;representations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear&#10;probing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any&#10;given cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine&#10;implicit in the Transformer weights.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10502v1) |&#10;| Alignment with nonlinear velocity couplings: collision&#45;avoidance and&#10; &#160;micro&#45;to&#45;macro mean&#45;field limits | Young&#45;Pil Choi, Michał Fabisiak, Jan Peszek | &#160;&#160;We investigate the pressureless fractional Euler&#45;alignment system with&#10;nonlinear velocity couplings, referred to as the $p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system.&#10;This model features a nonlinear velocity alignment force, interpreted as a&#10;density&#45;weighted fractional $p$&#45;Laplacian when the singularity parameter&#10;$alpha$ exceeds the spatial dimension $d$. Our primary goal is to establish&#10;the existence of solutions for strongly singular interactions ($alpha ge d$)&#10;and compactly supported initial conditions. We construct solutions as&#10;mean&#45;field limits of empirical measures from a kinetic variant of the&#10;$p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system. Specifically, we show that a sequence of empirical&#10;measures converges to a finite Radon measure, whose local density and velocity&#10;satisfy the $p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system. Our results are the first to prove the&#10;existence of solutions to this system in multi&#45;dimensional settings without&#10;significant initial data restrictions, covering both nonlinear ($p&gt;2$) and&#10;linear ($p=2$) cases. Additionally, we establish global existence, uniqueness,&#10;and collision avoidance for the corresponding particle ODE system under&#10;non&#45;collisional initial conditions, extending previous results for $1 &#10;e p &#10;e&#10;alpha + 2$. This analysis supports our mean&#45;field limit argument and&#10;contributes to understanding alignment models with singular communication.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10501v1) |&#10;| Focus diverse phase retrieval test results on broadband continuous&#10; &#160;wavefront sensing in space telescope applications | Hyukmo Kang, Kyle Van Gorkom, Meghdoot Biswas, Daewook Kim, Ewan S. Douglas | &#160;&#160;Continuous wavefront sensing benefits space observatories in on&#45;orbit optical&#10;performance maintenance. To measure the phase of a wavefront, phase retrieval&#10;is an attractive technique as it uses multiple point spread function (PSF)&#10;images that are acquired by the telescope itself without extra metrology&#10;systems nor complicated calibration. The focus diverse phase retrieval utilizes&#10;PSFs from predetermined defocused positions to enhance the dynamic range of the&#10;algorithm. We describe an updated visible light active optics testbed with the&#10;addition of a linear motorized focus stage. The performance of the phase&#10;retrieval algorithm in broadband is tested under various cases. While broadband&#10;pass filters have advantages in higher signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio (SNR), the&#10;performance of phase retrieval can be restricted due to blurred image caused by&#10;diffraction and increased computing cost. We used multiple bandpass filters (10&#10;nm, 88 nm, and 150 nm) and investigated effects of bandwidth on the accuracy&#10;and required image acquisition conditions such as SNR, reaching accuracies&#10;below 20 nm RMS wavefront error at the widest bandwidth. We also investigated&#10;the dynamic range of the phase retrieval algorithm depending on the bandwidth&#10;and required amount of defocus to expand dynamic range. Finally, we simulated&#10;the continuous wavefront sensing and correction loop with a range of&#10;statistically generated representative telescope disturbance time series to&#10;test for edge cases.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10500v1) |&#10;| The role of higher&#45;order terms in trapped&#45;ion quantum computing with&#10; &#160;magnetic gradient induced coupling | Sebastian Nagies, Kevin T. Geier, Javed Akram, Junichi Okamoto, Dimitris Badounas, Christof Wunderlich, Michael Johanning, Philipp Hauke | &#160;&#160;Trapped&#45;ion hardware based on the Magnetic Gradient Induced Coupling (MAGIC)&#10;scheme is emerging as a promising platform for quantum computing. Nevertheless,&#10;in this (as in any other) quantum&#45;computing platform, many technical questions&#10;still have to be resolved before large&#45;scale and error&#45;tolerant applications&#10;are possible. In this work, we present a thorough discussion of the&#10;contribution of higher&#45;order terms to the MAGIC setup, which can occur due to&#10;anharmonicities in the external potential of the ion crystal (e.g., through&#10;Coulomb repulsion) or through curvature of the applied magnetic field. These&#10;terms take the form of three&#45;spin couplings as well as diverse terms that&#10;couple spins to phonons. We find that most of these are negligible in realistic&#10;situations, with only two contributions that need careful attention. First,&#10;there are parasitic longitudinal fields whose strength increases with chain&#10;length, but which can easily be compensated by a microwave detuning. Second,&#10;anharmonicities of the Coulomb interaction can lead to well&#45;known two&#45;to&#45;one&#10;conversions of phonon excitations, which can be avoided if the phonons are&#10;ground&#45;state cooled. Our detailed analysis constitutes an important&#10;contribution on the way of making magnetic&#45;gradient trapped&#45;ion quantum&#10;technology fit for large&#45;scale applications, and it may inspire new ways to&#10;purposefully design interaction terms.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10498v1) |&#10;| MusicLIME: Explainable Multimodal Music Understanding | Theodoros Sotirou, Vassilis Lyberatos, Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Stamou | &#160;&#160;Multimodal models are critical for music understanding tasks, as they capture&#10;the complex interplay between audio and lyrics. However, as these models become&#10;more prevalent, the need for explainability grows&#45;understanding how these&#10;systems make decisions is vital for ensuring fairness, reducing bias, and&#10;fostering trust. In this paper, we introduce MusicLIME, a model&#45;agnostic&#10;feature importance explanation method designed for multimodal music models.&#10;Unlike traditional unimodal methods, which analyze each modality separately&#10;without considering the interaction between them, often leading to incomplete&#10;or misleading explanations, MusicLIME reveals how audio and lyrical features&#10;interact and contribute to predictions, providing a holistic view of the&#10;model&#39;s decision&#45;making. Additionally, we enhance local explanations by&#10;aggregating them into global explanations, giving users a broader perspective&#10;of model behavior. Through this work, we contribute to improving the&#10;interpretability of multimodal music models, empowering users to make informed&#10;choices, and fostering more equitable, fair, and transparent music&#10;understanding systems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10496v1) |&#10;| Incorporating Classifier&#45;Free Guidance in Diffusion Model&#45;Based&#10; &#160;Recommendation | Noah Buchanan, Susan Gauch, Quan Mai | &#160;&#160;This paper presents a diffusion&#45;based recommender system that incorporates&#10;classifier&#45;free guidance. Most current recommender systems provide&#10;recommendations using conventional methods such as collaborative or&#10;content&#45;based filtering. Diffusion is a new approach to generative AI that&#10;improves on previous generative AI approaches such as Variational Autoencoders&#10;(VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We incorporate diffusion in&#10;a recommender system that mirrors the sequence users take when browsing and&#10;rating items. Although a few current recommender systems incorporate diffusion,&#10;they do not incorporate classifier&#45;free guidance, a new innovation in diffusion&#10;models as a whole. In this paper, we present a diffusion recommender system&#10;that augments the underlying recommender system model for improved performance&#10;and also incorporates classifier&#45;free guidance. Our findings show improvements&#10;over state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art recommender systems for most metrics for several&#10;recommendation tasks on a variety of datasets. In particular, our approach&#10;demonstrates the potential to provide better recommendations when data is&#10;sparse.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10494v1) |&#10;| Renormalization of the Einstein&#45;Cartan Theory in First&#45;Order Form | F.

We study the&#10;renormalizability of this theory in the framework of the Batalin&#45;Vilkovisky&#10;formalism, which allows for a gauge invariant renormalization. Using the&#10;background field method, we discuss the gauge invariance of the background&#10;effective action and analyze the Ward identities which reflect the symmetries&#10;of the EC theory. As an application, we compute, in a general background gauge,&#10;the self&#45;energy of the tetrad field at one&#45;loop order.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10493v1) |&#10;| What we can learn from the angular differential rates (only) in&#10; &#160;semileptonic $B to D^* ell ν_ell$ decays | G.

Our approach is model independent and never requires the&#10;knowledge of $vert V_{cb}vert$. By studying such distributions in the case of&#10;light leptons, a comparison between results from different data sets from the&#10;Belle and BelleII Collaborations and between data and Standard Model&#10;calculations is also given for several interesting quantities.

Eisty | &#160;&#160;The growing trend of vulnerability issues in software development as a result&#10;of a large dependence on open&#45;source projects has received considerable&#10;attention recently. This paper investigates the effectiveness of Large Language&#10;Models (LLMs) in identifying vulnerabilities within codebases, with a focus on&#10;the latest advancements in LLM technology. Through a comparative analysis, we&#10;assess the performance of emerging LLMs, specifically Llama, CodeLlama, Gemma,&#10;and CodeGemma, alongside established state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art models such as BERT,&#10;RoBERTa, and GPT&#45;3. Our study aims to shed light on the capabilities of LLMs in&#10;vulnerability detection, contributing to the enhancement of software security&#10;practices across diverse open&#45;source repositories. We observe that CodeGemma&#10;achieves the highest F1&#45;score of 58 and a Recall of 87, amongst the recent&#10;additions of large language models to detect software security vulnerabilities.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10490v1) |&#10;| Flash STU: Fast Spectral Transform Units | Y.

Our paper aims to investigate if VLMs&#10;pre&#45;trained on web&#45;scale data learn to encode object states, which can be&#10;extracted with zero&#45;shot text prompts. We curate an object state recognition&#10;dataset ChangeIt&#45;Frames, and evaluate nine open&#45;source VLMs, including models&#10;trained with contrastive and generative objectives. We observe that while these&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art vision&#45;language models can reliably perform object&#10;recognition, they consistently fail to accurately distinguish the objects&#39;&#10;physical states. Through extensive experiments, we identify three areas for&#10;improvements for VLMs to better encode object states, namely the quality of&#10;object localization, the architecture to bind concepts to objects, and the&#10;objective to learn discriminative visual and language encoders on object&#10;states.

Ruan, Michael Eracleous, Daryl Haggard, Jessie C. Runnoe | &#160;&#160;The physical processes that produce X&#45;ray Quasi&#45;Periodic Eruptions (QPEs)&#10;recently discovered from the nuclei of several low&#45;redshift galaxies are&#10;mysterious. Several pieces of observational evidence strongly suggest a link&#10;between QPEs and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE). Previous studies also reveal&#10;that the morphologies of TDE host galaxies are highly concentrated, with high&#10;Sersic indicies, bulge&#45;to&#45;total light (B/T) ratios, and stellar surface mass&#10;densities relative to the broader galaxy population. We use these distinctive&#10;properties to test the link between QPEs and TDEs, by comparing these&#10;parameters of QPE host galaxies to TDE host galaxies. We employ archival Legacy&#10;Survey images of a sample of 9 QPE host galaxies and a sample of 13 TDE host&#10;galaxies, and model their surface brightness profiles. We show that QPE host&#10;galaxies have high Sersic indices of ~3, high B/T ratios of ~0.5, and high&#10;surface mass densities of ~10^10 Msun kpc^&#45;2. These properties are similar to&#10;TDE host galaxies, but are in strong contrast to a mass&#45; and redshift&#45;matched&#10;control sample of galaxies. We also find tentative evidence that the central&#10;black holes in both QPE and TDE host galaxies are undermassive relative to&#10;their stellar mass. The morphological similarities between QPE and TDE host&#10;galaxies at the population level add to the mounting evidence of a physical&#10;link between these phenomena, and favor QPE models that also invoke TDEs.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10486v1) |&#10;| Tuning the Rate of Tightly Packed Systems To Produce Planet Occurrence&#10; &#160;Trends with Galactic Height | Sarah Ballard | &#160;&#160;The formation of planetary systems has historically been considered in&#10;isolation, decoupled from processes on galactic scales. Recent findings&#10;employing data from ESA&#39;s Gaia mission challenge this narrative, identifying&#10;trends in planet occurrence with galactic kinematics and stellar age. The&#10;findings indicate changes in planet occurrence over and above the predicted&#10;changes from metallicity variation within the Milky Way, so that changes to&#10;stellar metallicity alone (long understood to be deterministic in planet&#10;outcomes) cannot explain the trends entirely. The scope of potential factors&#10;influencing planet formation has grown progressively wider, with accompanying&#10;theoretical support for galactic&#45;scale influences upon planet formation. In&#10;this manuscript, we investigate specifically how changes to the rate of Systems&#10;of Tightly&#45;packed Inner Planets (STIPs) could manifest as a trend in planet&#10;occurrence with galactic height. We focus our study upon M dwarf planetary&#10;systems for two reasons: first, they host STIPs at high rates, and secondly,&#10;their longevity makes them useful probes for kinematic trends over Gyr. We&#10;consider two models for a varying STIP rate: one in which STIP likelihood is&#10;determined by stellar age alone, irrespective of galactic time, and another in&#10;which the STIP likelihood suddenly increased in recent galactic history. Both&#10;models, which impose a higher STIP likelihood among younger stars, produce a&#10;negative gradient in planet occurrence with increasing height from the galactic&#10;midplane. We find that a step function model in which STIP likelihood increased&#10;by a factor of several ~a few Gyr ago resembles an observed trend among FGK&#10;dwarfs. We consider plausible physical mechanisms that could mimic the&#10;hypothesized model, given known links between STIP occurrence and other stellar&#10;and planetary properties.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10485v1) |&#10;| XLM for Autonomous Driving Systems: A Comprehensive Review | Sonda Fourati, Wael Jaafar, Noura Baccar, Safwan Alfattani | &#160;&#160;Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable proficiency in various&#10;information&#45;processing tasks. These tasks span from extracting data and&#10;summarizing literature to generating content, predictive modeling,&#10;decision&#45;making, and system controls. Moreover, Vision Large Models (VLMs) and&#10;Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which represent the next generation of language&#10;models, a.k.a., XLMs, can combine and integrate many data modalities with the&#10;strength of language understanding, thus advancing several information&#45;based&#10;systems, such as Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). Indeed, by combining&#10;language communication with multimodal sensory inputs, e.g., panoramic images&#10;and LiDAR or radar data, accurate driving actions can be taken. In this&#10;context, we provide in this survey paper a comprehensive overview of the&#10;potential of XLMs towards achieving autonomous driving. Specifically, we review&#10;the relevant literature on ADS and XLMs, including their architectures, tools,&#10;and frameworks. Then, we detail the proposed approaches to deploy XLMs for&#10;autonomous driving solutions.

Fay, Nicolas Ferré, Miquel Huix&#45;Rotllant | &#160;&#160;Electronic polarization and dispersion are decisive actors in determining&#10;interaction energies between molecules. These interactions have a particularly&#10;profound effect on excitation energies of molecules in complex environments,&#10;especially when the excitation involves a significant degree of charge&#10;reorganisation. The direct reaction field (DRF) approach, which has seen a&#10;recent revival of interest, provides a powerful framework for describing these&#10;interactions in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models of&#10;systems, where a small subsystem of interest is described using quantum&#10;chemical methods and the remainder is treated with a simple MM force field. In&#10;this paper we show how the DRF approach can be combined with the electrostatic&#10;potential fitted (ESPF) multipole operator description of the QM region charge&#10;density, which reduces the scaling $mathcal{O}(N_mathrm{MM}^3)$ of the method&#10;with MM system to $mathcal{O}(N_mathrm{MM}^2)$. We also show how the DRF&#10;approach can be combined with fluctuating charge descriptions of the&#10;polarizable environment, as well as previously used atom&#45;centred&#10;dipole&#45;polarizability based models. We further show that the ESPF&#45;DRF method&#10;provides an accurate description of molecular interactions in both ground and&#10;excited electronic states of the QM system and apply it to predict the gas to&#10;aqueous solution solvatochromic shifts in the UV/visible absorption spectrum of&#10;acrolein.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10483v1) |&#10;| Schrodinger&#39;s Memory: Large Language Models | Wei Wang, Qing Li | &#160;&#160;Memory is the foundation of LLMs&#39; functionality, yet past research has lacked&#10;an in&#45;depth exploration of their memory capabilities and underlying theory.

These assumptions limit their use&#10;when acquisition conditions, such as the subject&#39;s distance from the camera or&#10;the camera&#39;s characteristics, are different than expected, as typically happens&#10;in video surveillance. Additionally, 3DFR algorithms follow various strategies&#10;to address the reconstruction of a 3D shape from 2D data, such as statistical&#10;model fitting, photometric stereo, or deep learning. In the present study, we&#10;explore the application of three 3DFR algorithms representative of the SOTA,&#10;employing each one as the template set generator for a face verification&#10;system. The scores provided by each system are combined by score&#45;level fusion.&#10;We show that the complementarity induced by different 3DFR algorithms improves&#10;performance when tests are conducted at never&#45;seen&#45;before distances from the&#10;camera and camera characteristics (cross&#45;distance and cross&#45;camera settings),&#10;thus encouraging further investigations on multiple 3DFR&#45;based approaches.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10481v1) |&#10;| Addressing misspecification in contextual optimization | Omar Bennouna, Jiawei Zhang, Saurabh Amin, Asuman Ozdaglar | &#160;&#160;We study a linear contextual optimization problem where a decision maker has&#10;access to historical data and contextual features to learn a cost prediction&#10;model aimed at minimizing decision error. We adopt the predict&#45;then&#45;optimize&#10;framework for this analysis. Given that perfect model alignment with reality is&#10;often unrealistic in practice, we focus on scenarios where the chosen&#10;hypothesis set is misspecified. In this context, it remains unclear whether&#10;current contextual optimization approaches can effectively address such model&#10;misspecification. In this paper, we present a novel integrated learning and&#10;optimization approach designed to tackle model misspecification in contextual&#10;optimization. This approach offers theoretical generalizability, tractability,&#10;and optimality guarantees, along with strong practical performance. Our method&#10;involves minimizing a tractable surrogate loss that aligns with the performance&#10;value from cost vector predictions, regardless of whether the model&#10;misspecified or not, and can be optimized in reasonable time.

One of the classical and popular approaches is Local&#10;Stochastic Gradient Descent (Local SGD), characterized by multiple local&#10;updates before averaging, which is particularly useful in distributed&#10;environments to reduce communication bottlenecks and improve scalability. A&#10;typical feature of this method is the dependence on the frequency of&#10;communications. But in the case of a quadratic target function with homogeneous&#10;data distribution over all devices, the influence of frequency of&#10;communications vanishes. As a natural consequence, subsequent studies include&#10;the assumption of a Lipschitz Hessian, as this indicates the similarity of the&#10;optimized function to a quadratic one to some extent. However, in order to&#10;extend the completeness of the Local SGD theory and unlock its potential, in&#10;this paper we abandon the Lipschitz Hessian assumption by introducing a new&#10;concept of $textit{approximate quadraticity}$. This assumption gives a new&#10;perspective on problems that have near quadratic properties. In addition,&#10;existing theoretical analyses of Local SGD often assume bounded variance. We,&#10;in turn, consider the unbounded noise condition, which allows us to broaden the&#10;class of studied problems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10478v1) |&#10;| SimInversion: A Simple Framework for Inversion&#45;Based Text&#45;to&#45;Image&#10; &#160;Editing | Qi Qian, Haiyang Xu, Ming Yan, Juhua Hu | &#160;&#160;Diffusion models demonstrate impressive image generation performance with&#10;text guidance. Inspired by the learning process of diffusion, existing images&#10;can be edited according to text by DDIM inversion. However, the vanilla DDIM&#10;inversion is not optimized for classifier&#45;free guidance and the accumulated&#10;error will result in the undesired performance. While many algorithms are&#10;developed to improve the framework of DDIM inversion for editing, in this work,&#10;we investigate the approximation error in DDIM inversion and propose to&#10;disentangle the guidance scale for the source and target branches to reduce the&#10;error while keeping the original framework. Moreover, a better guidance scale&#10;(i.e., 0.5) than default settings can be derived theoretically. Experiments on&#10;PIE&#45;Bench show that our proposal can improve the performance of DDIM inversion&#10;dramatically without sacrificing efficiency.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10476v1) |&#10;| Leadership and Engagement Dynamics in Legislative Twitter Networks:&#10; &#160;Statistical Analysis and Modeling | Carolina Luque, Juan Sosa | &#160;&#160;In this manuscript, we analyze the interaction network on Twitter among&#10;members of the 117th U.S. Congress to assess the visibility of political&#10;leaders and explore how systemic properties and node attributes influence the&#10;formation of legislative connections. We employ descriptive social network&#10;statistical methods, the exponential random graph model (ERGM), and the&#10;stochastic block model (SBM) to evaluate the relative impact of network&#10;systemic properties, as well as institutional and personal traits, on the&#10;generation of online relationships among legislators. Our findings reveal that&#10;legislative networks on social media platforms like Twitter tend to reinforce&#10;the leadership of dominant political actors rather than diminishing their&#10;influence. However, we identify that these leadership roles can manifest in&#10;various forms. Additionally, we highlight that online connections within&#10;legislative networks are influenced by both the systemic properties of the&#10;network and institutional characteristics.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10475v1) |&#10;| MacDiff: Unified Skeleton Modeling with Masked Conditional Diffusion | Lehong Wu, Lilang Lin, Jiahang Zhang, Yiyang Ma, Jiaying Liu | &#160;&#160;Self&#45;supervised learning has proved effective for skeleton&#45;based human action&#10;understanding. However, previous works either rely on contrastive learning that&#10;suffers false negative problems or are based on reconstruction that learns too&#10;much unessential low&#45;level clues, leading to limited representations for&#10;downstream tasks. Recently, great advances have been made in generative&#10;learning, which is naturally a challenging yet meaningful pretext task to model&#10;the general underlying data distributions. However, the representation learning&#10;capacity of generative models is under&#45;explored, especially for the skeletons&#10;with spacial sparsity and temporal redundancy. To this end, we propose Masked&#10;Conditional Diffusion (MacDiff) as a unified framework for human skeleton&#10;modeling. For the first time, we leverage diffusion models as effective&#10;skeleton representation learners. Specifically, we train a diffusion decoder&#10;conditioned on the representations extracted by a semantic encoder. Random&#10;masking is applied to encoder inputs to introduce a information bottleneck and&#10;remove redundancy of skeletons. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that&#10;our generative objective involves the contrastive learning objective which&#10;aligns the masked and noisy views. Meanwhile, it also enforces the&#10;representation to complement for the noisy view, leading to better&#10;generalization performance. MacDiff achieves state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art performance on&#10;representation learning benchmarks while maintaining the competence for&#10;generative tasks. Moreover, we leverage the diffusion model for data&#10;augmentation, significantly enhancing the fine&#45;tuning performance in scenarios&#10;with scarce labeled data.

Hassan | &#160;&#160;The proliferation of open Pre&#45;trained Language Models (PTLMs) on model&#10;registry platforms like Hugging Face (HF) presents both opportunities and&#10;challenges for companies building products around them. Similar to traditional&#10;software dependencies, PTLMs continue to evolve after a release. However, the&#10;current state of release practices of PTLMs on model registry platforms are&#10;plagued by a variety of inconsistencies, such as ambiguous naming conventions&#10;and inaccessible model training documentation. Given the knowledge gap on&#10;current PTLM release practices, our empirical study uses a mixed&#45;methods&#10;approach to analyze the releases of 52,227 PTLMs on the most well&#45;known model&#10;registry, HF. Our results reveal 148 different naming practices for PTLM&#10;releases, with 40.87% of changes to model weight files not represented in the&#10;adopted name&#45;based versioning practice or their documentation. In addition, we&#10;identified that the 52,227 PTLMs are derived from only 299 different base&#10;models (the modified original models used to create 52,227 PTLMs), with&#10;Fine&#45;tuning and Quantization being the most prevalent modification methods&#10;applied to these base models. Significant gaps in release transparency, in&#10;terms of training dataset specifications and model card availability, still&#10;exist, highlighting the need for standardized documentation. While we&#10;identified a model naming practice explicitly differentiating between major and&#10;minor PTLM releases, we did not find any significant difference in the types of&#10;changes that went into either type of releases, suggesting that major/minor&#10;version numbers for PTLMs often are chosen arbitrarily. Our findings provide&#10;valuable insights to improve PTLM release practices, nudging the field towards&#10;more formal semantic versioning practices.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10472v1) |&#10;| Real&#45;Time Whole&#45;Body Control of Legged Robots with Model&#45;Predictive Path&#10; &#160;Integral Control | Juan Alvarez&#45;Padilla, John Z. Zhang, Sofia Kwok, John M. Dolan, Zachary Manchester | &#160;&#160;This paper presents a system for enabling real&#45;time synthesis of whole&#45;body&#10;locomotion and manipulation policies for real&#45;world legged robots. Motivated by&#10;recent advancements in robot simulation, we leverage the efficient&#10;parallelization capabilities of the MuJoCo simulator to achieve fast sampling&#10;over the robot state and action trajectories. Our results show surprisingly&#10;effective real&#45;world locomotion and manipulation capabilities with a very&#10;simple control strategy. We demonstrate our approach on several hardware and&#10;simulation experiments: robust locomotion over flat and uneven terrains,&#10;climbing over a box whose height is comparable to the robot, and pushing a box&#10;to a goal position. To our knowledge, this is the first successful deployment&#10;of whole&#45;body sampling&#45;based MPC on real&#45;world legged robot hardware.&#10;Experiment videos and code can be found at: https://whole&#45;body&#45;mppi.github.io/&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10469v1) |&#10;| Assortativity in sympatric speciation and species classification | Joao U. F. Lizarraga, Flavia M. D. Marquitti, Marcus A. M. de Aguiar | &#160;&#160;We investigate the role of assortative mating in speciation using the&#10;sympatric model of Derrida and Higgs. The model explores the idea that genetic&#10;differences create incompatibilities between individuals, preventing mating if&#10;the number of such differences is too large. Speciation, however, only happens&#10;in this mating system if the number of genes is large. Here we show that&#10;speciation with small genome sizes can occur if assortative mating is&#10;introduced. In our model individuals are represented by three chromosomes: one&#10;responsible for reproductive compatibility, one for coding the trait on which&#10;assortativity will operate, and a neutral chromosome. Reproduction is possible&#10;if individuals are genetically similar with respect to the first chromosome,&#10;but among these compatible mating partners, the one with the most similar trait&#10;coded by the second chromosome is selected. We show that this type of&#10;assortativity facilitates speciation, which can happen with a small number of&#10;genes in the first chromosome. Species, classified according to reproductive&#10;isolation, dictated by the first chromosome, can display different traits&#10;values, as measured by the second and the third chromosomes. Therefore, species&#10;can also be identified based on similarity of the neutral trait, which works as&#10;a proxy for reproductive isolation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10466v1) |&#10;| A stabilized total pressure&#45;formulation of the Biot&#39;s poroelasticity&#10; &#160;equations in frequency domain: numerical analysis and applications | Cristian Cárcamo, Alfonso Caiazzo, Felipe Galarce, Joaquín Mura | &#160;&#160;This work focuses on the numerical solution of the dynamics of a poroelastic&#10;material in the frequency domain. We provide a detailed stability analysis&#10;based on the application of the Fredholm alternative in the continuous case,&#10;considering a total pressure formulation of the Biot&#39;s equations. In the&#10;discrete setting, we propose a stabilized equal order finite element method&#10;complemented by an additional pressure stabilization to enhance the robustness&#10;of the numerical scheme with respect to the fluid permeability. Utilizing the&#10;Fredholm alternative, we extend the well&#45;posedness results to the discrete&#10;setting, obtaining theoretical optimal convergence for the case of linear&#10;finite elements. We present different numerical experiments to validate the&#10;proposed method. First, we consider model problems with known analytic&#10;solutions in two and three dimensions. As next, we show that the method is&#10;robust for a wide range of permeabilities, including the case of discontinuous&#10;coefficients. Lastly, we show the application for the simulation of brain&#10;elastography on a realistic brain geometry obtained from medical imaging.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10465v1) |&#10;| New Direct Sum Tests | Alek Westover, Edward Yu, Kai Zheng | &#160;&#160;A function $f:[n]^{d} to mathbb{F}_2$ is a defn{direct sum} if there are&#10;functions $L_i:[n]to mathbb{F}_2$ such that ${f(x) = sum_{i}L_i(x_i)}$. In&#10;this work we give multiple results related to the property testing of direct&#10;sums.&#10; &#160;Our first result concerns a test proposed by Dinur and Golubev in 2019. We&#10;call their test the Diamond test and show that it is indeed a direct sum&#10;tester. More specifically, we show that if a function $f$ is $epsilon$&#45;far&#10;from being a direct sum function, then the Diamond test rejects $f$ with&#10;probability at least $Omega_{n,epsilon}(1)$. Even in the case of $n = 2$, the&#10;Diamond test is, to the best of our knowledge, novel and yields a new tester&#10;for the classic property of affinity.&#10; &#160;Apart from the Diamond test, we also analyze a broad family of direct sum&#10;tests, which at a high level, run an arbitrary affinity test on the restriction&#10;of $f$ to a random hypercube inside of $[n]^d$. This family of tests includes&#10;the direct sum test analyzed in cite{di19}, but does not include the Diamond&#10;test. As an application of our result, we obtain a direct sum test which works&#10;in the online adversary model of cite{KRV}.&#10; &#160;Finally, we also discuss a Fourier analytic interpretation of the diamond&#10;tester in the $n=2$ case, as well as prove local correction results for direct&#10;sum as conjectured by Dinur and Golubev.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10464v1) |&#10;| Kolmogorov&#45;Arnold Networks in Low&#45;Data Regimes: A Comparative Study with&#10; &#160;Multilayer Perceptrons | Farhad Pourkamali&#45;Anaraki | &#160;&#160;Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) have long been a cornerstone in deep learning,&#10;known for their capacity to model complex relationships. Recently,&#10;Kolmogorov&#45;Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a compelling alternative,&#10;utilizing highly flexible learnable activation functions directly on network&#10;edges, a departure from the neuron&#45;centric approach of MLPs. However, KANs&#10;significantly increase the number of learnable parameters, raising concerns&#10;about their effectiveness in data&#45;scarce environments. This paper presents a&#10;comprehensive comparative study of MLPs and KANs from both algorithmic and&#10;experimental perspectives, with a focus on low&#45;data regimes. We introduce an&#10;effective technique for designing MLPs with unique, parameterized activation&#10;functions for each neuron, enabling a more balanced comparison with KANs. Using&#10;empirical evaluations on simulated data and two real&#45;world data sets from&#10;medicine and engineering, we explore the trade&#45;offs between model complexity&#10;and accuracy, with particular attention to the role of network depth. Our&#10;findings show that MLPs with individualized activation functions achieve&#10;significantly higher predictive accuracy with only a modest increase in&#10;parameters, especially when the sample size is limited to around one hundred.&#10;For example, in a three&#45;class classification problem within additive&#10;manufacturing, MLPs achieve a median accuracy of 0.91, significantly&#10;outperforming KANs, which only reach a median accuracy of 0.53 with default&#10;hyperparameters. These results offer valuable insights into the impact of&#10;activation function selection in neural networks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10463v1) |&#10;| Effects of synapse location, delay and background stochastic activity on&#10; &#160;synchronising hippocampal CA1 neurons | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore | &#160;&#160;We study the synchronisation of neurons in a realistic model under the&#10;Hodgkin&#45;Huxley dynamics. To focus on the role of the different locations of the&#10;excitatory synapses, we use two identical neurons where the set of input&#10;signals is grouped at two different distances from the soma. The system is&#10;intended to represent a CA1 hippocampal neuron in which the synapses arriving&#10;from the CA3 neurons of the trisynaptic pathway appear to be localised in the&#10;apical dendritic region and are, in principle, either proximal or distal to the&#10;soma. Synchronisation is studied using a specifically defined spiking&#10;correlation function as a function of various parameters such as the distance&#10;from the soma of one of the synaptic groups, the inhibition weight and the&#10;associated activation delay. We found that the neurons&#39; spiking activity&#10;depends nonmonotonically on the relative dendritic location of the synapses and&#10;their inhibitory weight, whereas the synchronisation measure always decreases&#10;with inhibition, and strongly depends on its activation time delay. The&#10;background activity on the somas results essentially independent on the&#10;fluctuation intensity and strongly support the importance of the balance&#10;between inhibition and excitation for neuronal synchronization.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10460v1) |&#10;| Efficiently Crowdsourcing Visual Importance with Punch&#45;Hole Annotation | Minsuk Chang, Soohyun Lee, Aeri Cho, Hyeon Jeon, Seokhyeon Park, Cindy Xiong Bearfield, Jinwook Seo | &#160;&#160;We introduce a novel crowdsourcing method for identifying important areas in&#10;graphical images through punch&#45;hole labeling. Traditional methods, such as gaze&#10;trackers and mouse&#45;based annotations, which generate continuous data, can be&#10;impractical in crowdsourcing scenarios. They require many participants, and the&#10;outcome data can be noisy. In contrast, our method first segments the graphical&#10;image with a grid and drops a portion of the patches (punch holes). Then, we&#10;iteratively ask the labeler to validate each annotation with holes, narrowing&#10;down the annotation only having the most important area. This approach aims to&#10;reduce annotation noise in crowdsourcing by standardizing the annotations while&#10;enhancing labeling efficiency and reliability. Preliminary findings from&#10;fundamental charts demonstrate that punch&#45;hole labeling can effectively&#10;pinpoint critical regions. This also highlights its potential for broader&#10;application in visualization research, particularly in studying large&#45;scale&#10;users&#39; graphical perception. Our future work aims to enhance the algorithm to&#10;achieve faster labeling speed and prove its utility through large&#45;scale&#10;experiments.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10459v1) |&#10;| Full distribution of local observables in an exactly solvable current&#10; &#160;carrying steady states of a driven XXZ chain | Sandipan Manna, G J Sreejith | &#160;&#160;Current carrying steady states of interacting spins chains exhibit rich&#10;structures generated through an interplay of current induced correlations and&#10;energetic constraints from the Hamiltonian. The XXZ spin chain when coupled to&#10;maximally polarizing Lindblad terms admits an exact solution in a matrix&#10;product state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations&#10;and distributions of simple local spin observables in the non equilibrium&#10;steady state (NESS). We present exact expressions for spin correlators, entropy&#10;per site, cumulant generating functions for distributions of local observables&#10;in the XX limit (Ising anisotropy $Delta=0$). Further, we use the exact MPS&#10;solution in systems with $Delta&gt;0$, to numerically exactly calculate the&#10;entropy, correlations, as well as distributions of spin observables in blocks&#10;as large as $nsim 200$ sites allowing an estimation of the rate functions. The&#10;$z$ magnetization distribution is consistant with short range spin correlations&#10;in the $z$ direction while the $x$&#45;magnetization shows a double peak structure&#10;at larger $Delta$ suggesting short range ferromagnetic ordering. We find that&#10;the distribution of $z$&#45;magnetization sharpens for parameters where the current&#10;is maximized.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10458v1) |&#10;| Mean Residual Life Ageing Intensity Function | Ashutosh Singh, Ishapathik Das, Asok Kumar Nanda, Sumen Sen | &#160;&#160;The ageing intensity function is a powerful analytical tool that provides&#10;valuable insights into the ageing process across diverse domains such as&#10;reliability engineering, actuarial science, and healthcare. Its applications&#10;continue to expand as researchers delve deeper into understanding the complex&#10;dynamics of ageing and its implications for society. One common approach to&#10;defining the ageing intensity function is through the hazard rate or failure&#10;rate function, extensively explored in scholarly literature. Equally&#10;significant to the hazard rate function is the mean residual life function,&#10;which plays a crucial role in analyzing the ageing patterns exhibited by units&#10;or components. This article introduces the mean residual life ageing intensity&#10;(MRLAI) function to delve into component ageing behaviours across various&#10;distributions. Additionally, we scrutinize the closure properties of the MRLAI&#10;function across different reliability operations. Furthermore, a new order&#10;termed the mean residual life ageing intensity order is defined to analyze the&#10;ageing behaviour of a system, and the closure property of this order under&#10;various reliability operations is discussed.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10456v1) |&#10;| Quantile Fourier regressions for decision making under uncertainty | Arash Khojaste, Geoffrey Pritchard, Golbon Zakeri | &#160;&#160;Weconsider Markov decision processes arising from a Markov model of an&#10;underlying natural phenomenon. Such phenomena are usually periodic (e.g.&#10;annual) in time, and so the Markov processes modelling them must be&#10;time&#45;inhomogeneous, with cyclostationary rather than stationary behaviour. We&#10;describe a technique for constructing such processes that allows for periodic&#10;variations both in the values taken by the process and in the serial dependence&#10;structure. We include two illustrative numerical examples: a hydropower&#10;scheduling problem and a model of offshore wind power integration.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10455v1) |&#10;| The Debiased Near&#45;Earth Object Population from ATLAS Telescopes | Rogerio Deienno, Larry Denneau, David Nesvorný, David Vokrouhlický, William F. Bottke, Robert Jedicke, Shantanu Naidu, Steven R. Chesley, Davide Farnocchia, Paul W. Chodas | &#160;&#160;This work is dedicated to debias the Near&#45;Earth Objects (NEO) population&#10;based on observations from the Asteroid Terrestrial&#45;impact Last Alert System&#10;(ATLAS) telescopes. We have applied similar methods used to develop the&#10;recently released NEO model generator (NEOMOD), once debiasing the NEO&#10;population using data from Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) G96 telescope. ATLAS is&#10;composed of four different telescopes. We first analyzed observational data&#10;from each of all four telescopes separately and later combined them. Our&#10;results highlight main differences between CSS and ATLAS, e.g., sky coverage&#10;and survey power at debiasing the NEO population. ATLAS has a much larger sky&#10;coverage than CSS, allowing it to find bright NEOs that would be constantly&#10;&quot;hiding&quot; from CSS. Consequently, ATLAS is more powerful than CSS at debiasing&#10;the NEO population for H $&#10;esssim$ 19. With its intrinsically greater&#10;sensitivity and emphasis on observing near opposition, CSS excels in the&#10;debiasing of smaller objects. ATLAS, as an all sky survey designed to find&#10;imminent hazardous objects, necessarily spends a significant fraction of time&#10;looking at places on the sky where objects do not appear, reducing its power&#10;for debiasing the population of small objects. We estimate a NEO population&#10;completeness of $approx$ 88%$^{+3%}_{&#45;2%}$ for H $&lt;$ 17.75 and $approx$&#10;36%$^{+1%}_{&#45;1%}$ for H $&lt;$ 22.25. Those numbers are similar to previous&#10;estimates (within error bars for H $&lt;$ 17.75) from CSS, yet, around 3% and 8%&#10;smaller at their face values, respectively. We also confirm previous finding&#10;that the $&#10;u_6$ secular resonance is the main source of small and faint NEOs&#10;at H = 28, whereas the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter dominates for&#10;larger and brighter NEOs at H = 15.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10453v1) |&#10;| Signed Graph Autoencoder for Explainable and Polarization&#45;Aware Network&#10; &#160;Embeddings | Nikolaos Nakis, Chrysoula Kosma, Giannis Nikolentzos, Michalis Chatzianastasis, Iakovos Evdaimon, Michalis Vazirgiannis | &#160;&#160;Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant&#10;attention in recent years for their ability to extract informative latent&#10;representations, characterizing the structure of complex topologies, such as&#10;graphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited&#10;focus on developing and evaluating explainable neural&#45;based graph generative&#10;models specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we&#10;propose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE&#10;extracts node&#45;level representations that express node memberships over distinct&#10;extreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is&#10;achieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its&#10;polarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for&#10;analyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with&#10;relational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation&#10;demonstrates the SGAAEs&#39; capability to successfully infer node memberships over&#10;the different underlying latent structures while extracting competing&#10;communities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the&#10;network. Additionally, we introduce the 2&#45;level network polarization problem&#10;and show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model&#10;achieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across&#10;four real&#45;world datasets, outperforming several baseline models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10452v1) |&#10;| Why you should also use OLS estimation of tail exponents | Thiago Trafane Oliveira Santos, Daniel Oliveira Cajueiro | &#160;&#160;Even though practitioners often estimate Pareto exponents running OLS&#10;rank&#45;size regressions, the usual recommendation is to use the Hill MLE with a&#10;small&#45;sample correction instead, due to its unbiasedness and efficiency. In&#10;this paper, we advocate that you should also apply OLS in empirical&#10;applications. On the one hand, we demonstrate that, with a small&#45;sample&#10;correction, the OLS estimator is also unbiased. On the other hand, we show that&#10;the MLE assigns significantly greater weight to smaller observations. This&#10;suggests that the OLS estimator may outperform the MLE in cases where the&#10;distribution is (i) strictly Pareto but only in the upper tail or (ii)&#10;regularly varying rather than strictly Pareto. We substantiate our theoretical&#10;findings with Monte Carlo simulations and real&#45;world applications,&#10;demonstrating the practical relevance of the OLS method in estimating tail&#10;exponents.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10448v1) |&#10;| Hydrodynamic hovering of swimming bacteria above surfaces | Pyae Hein Htet, Debasish Das, Eric Lauga | &#160;&#160;Flagellated bacteria are hydrodynamically attracted to rigid walls, yet past&#10;work shows a &#39;hovering&#39; state where they swim stably at a finite height above&#10;surfaces. We use numerics and theory to reveal the physical origin of hovering.&#10;Simulations first show that hovering requires an elongated cell body and&#10;results from a tilt away from the wall. Theoretical models then identify two&#10;essential asymmetries: the response of width&#45;asymmetric cells to active flows&#10;created by length&#45;asymmetric cells. A minimal model reconciles near and&#10;far&#45;field hydrodynamics, capturing all key features of hovering.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10447v1) |&#10;| KoroT&#45;3E: A Personalized Musical Mnemonics Tool for Enhancing Memory&#10; &#160;Retention of Complex Computer Science Concepts | Xiangzhe Yuan, Jiajun Wang, Siying Hu, Andrew Cheung, Zhicong Lu | &#160;&#160;As the demand for computer science (CS) skills grows, mastering foundational&#10;concepts is crucial yet challenging for novice learners.

We&#10;conducted semi&#45;structured interviews (n=12) to investigate why novice learners&#10;find it challenging to memorize and understand CS concepts. The findings,&#10;combined with constructivist learning theory, established our initial design,&#10;which was then refined following consultations with CS education experts. An&#10;empirical experiment(n=36) showed that those using KoroT&#45;3E (n=18)&#10;significantly outperformed the control group (n=18), with improved memory&#10;efficiency, increased motivation, and a positive learning experience.

From&#10;that, DeWi can learn discriminative and in&#45;depth features of insect pests&#10;(deep) yet still generalize well to a large number of insect categories (wide).&#10;Experimental results show that DeWi achieves the highest performances on two&#10;insect pest classification benchmarks (76.44% accuracy on the IP102 dataset&#10;and 99.79% accuracy on the D0 dataset, respectively). In addition, extensive&#10;evaluations and ablation studies are conducted to thoroughly investigate our&#10;DeWi and demonstrate its superiority.

Behavior trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robot&#10;task planning for their modularity and flexibility, but manually designing them&#10;can be effort&#45;intensive. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been&#10;applied in robotic task planning for generating action sequences, but their&#10;ability to generate BTs has not been fully investigated. To this end, We&#10;propose LLM as BT&#45;planner, a novel framework to leverage LLMs for BT generation&#10;in robotic assembly task planning and execution. Four in&#45;context learning&#10;methods are introduced to utilize the natural language processing and inference&#10;capabilities of LLMs to produce task plans in BT format, reducing manual effort&#10;and ensuring robustness and comprehensibility. We also evaluate the performance&#10;of fine&#45;tuned, fewer&#45;parameter LLMs on the same tasks. Experiments in simulated&#10;and real&#45;world settings show that our framework enhances LLMs&#39; performance in&#10;BT generation, improving success rates in BT generation through in&#45;context&#10;learning and supervised fine&#45;tuning.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10444v1) |&#10;| The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration. II.&#10; &#160;Mid&#45;Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy | Karl D. Gordon, G. C. Sloan, Macarena Garcia Marin, Mattia Libralato, George Rieke, Jonathan A. Aguilar, Ralph Bohlin, Misty Cracraft, Marjorie Decleir, Andras Gaspar, David R. Law, Alberto Noriega&#45;Crespo, Michael Regan | &#160;&#160;The absolute flux calibration of the Mid&#45;Infrared Instrument Imaging and&#10;Coronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first&#10;2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the&#10;flux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays,&#10;and different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining&#10;observed aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions&#10;based on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of&#10;these observations were combined with model point&#45;spread&#45;functions to measure&#10;the corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with&#10;time, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time,&#10;rate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations&#10;were with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately&#10;every month revealed a modest time&#45;dependent response loss seen mainly at the&#10;longest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential&#10;with a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the&#10;band&#45;dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was&#10;found to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different&#10;subarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting&#10;for the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors&#10;measured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The&#10;formal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are&#10;0.3 to 1.0%, with longer&#45;wavelength bands generally having larger&#10;uncertainties.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10443v1) |&#10;| CtRNet&#45;X: Camera&#45;to&#45;Robot Pose Estimation in Real&#45;world Conditions Using&#10; &#160;a Single Camera | Jingpei Lu, Zekai Liang, Tristin Xie, Florian Ritcher, Shan Lin, Sainan Liu, Michael C. Yip | &#160;&#160;Camera&#45;to&#45;robot calibration is crucial for vision&#45;based robot control and&#10;requires effort to make it accurate. Recent advancements in markerless pose&#10;estimation methods have eliminated the need for time&#45;consuming physical setups&#10;for camera&#45;to&#45;robot calibration. While the existing markerless pose estimation&#10;methods have demonstrated impressive accuracy without the need for cumbersome&#10;setups, they rely on the assumption that all the robot joints are visible&#10;within the camera&#39;s field of view. However, in practice, robots usually move in&#10;and out of view, and some portion of the robot may stay out&#45;of&#45;frame during the&#10;whole manipulation task due to real&#45;world constraints, leading to a lack of&#10;sufficient visual features and subsequent failure of these approaches. To&#10;address this challenge and enhance the applicability to vision&#45;based robot&#10;control, we propose a novel framework capable of estimating the robot pose with&#10;partially visible robot manipulators. Our approach leverages the&#10;Vision&#45;Language Models for fine&#45;grained robot components detection, and&#10;integrates it into a keypoint&#45;based pose estimation network, which enables more&#10;robust performance in varied operational conditions. The framework is evaluated&#10;on both public robot datasets and self&#45;collected partial&#45;view datasets to&#10;demonstrate our robustness and generalizability. As a result, this method is&#10;effective for robot pose estimation in a wider range of real&#45;world manipulation&#10;scenarios.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10441v1) |&#10;| Successive topological phase transitions in two distinct spin&#45;flop&#10; &#160;phases on the honeycomb lattice | Xudong Li, Jize Zhao, Jinbin Li, Qiang Luo | &#160;&#160;The Kitaev magnets with bond&#45;dependent interactions have garnered&#10;considerable attention in recent years for their ability to harbor exotic&#10;phases and nontrivial excitations. The topological magnons, which are indicated&#10;by nonzero Chern number and thermal Hall conductivity, are proposed to&#10;partially explain thermal Hall measurements in real materials. Hitherto,&#10;topological magnons have been extensively explored when the magnetic field is&#10;normal to the honeycomb plane, but their topological characteristics are less&#10;studied in the presence of in&#45;plane magnetic field. Here, we study two distinct&#10;in&#45;plane field induced spin&#45;flop phases in the $Gamma$&#45;$Gamma&#39;$ model, both&#10;of which are off&#45;diagonal couplings that have intimate relation to the Kitaev&#10;interaction. The two spin&#45;flop phases are distinguished by their out&#45;of&#45;plane&#10;spin components which can be either antiparallel or parallel, thus dubbing&#10;antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) spin&#45;flop phases, respectively.&#10;We map out topological phase diagrams for both phases, revealing a rich pattern&#10;of the Chern number over exchange parameters and magnetic field. We&#10;analytically calculate the boundaries of topological phase transitions when the&#10;magnetic field is along the $a$ and $b$ directions. We find that the thermal&#10;Hall conductivity and its derivative display contrasting behaviors when&#10;crossing different topological phase transitions. The striking difference of&#10;the two phases lies in that when the magnetic field is along the $b$ direction,&#10;topological magnons are totally absent in the AFM spin&#45;flop phase, while they&#10;can survive in the FM analogue in certain parameter regions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10439v1) |&#10;| A functorial approach to $n$&#45;abelian categories | Vitor Gulisz | &#160;&#160;We develop a functorial approach to the study of $n$&#45;abelian categories by&#10;reformulating their axioms in terms of their categories of finitely presented&#10;functors. Such an approach allows the use of classical homological algebra and&#10;representation theory techniques to understand higher homological algebra. As&#10;an application, we present two possible generalizations of the axioms &quot;every&#10;monomorphism is a kernel&quot; and &quot;every epimorphism is a cokernel&quot; of an abelian&#10;category to $n$&#45;abelian categories. We also specialize our results to modules&#10;over rings, thereby describing when the category of finitely generated&#10;projective modules over a ring is $n$&#45;abelian. Moreover, we establish a&#10;correspondence for $n$&#45;abelian categories with additive generators, which&#10;extends the higher Auslander correspondence.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10438v1) |&#10;| Color symmetry breaking in the Potts spin glass | Jean&#45;Christophe Mourrat | &#160;&#160;The Potts spin glass is an analogue of the Sherrington&#45;Kirkpatrick model in&#10;which each spin can take one of $kappa$ possible values, which we interpret as&#10;colors.

Whole genome sequence data augmented with demographic metadata&#10;provides the best opportunity to do this. We use Random Forest Decision Tree&#10;models to analyse a combination of over 4000 SARS&#45;CoV2 sequences from a densely&#10;sampled, mixed urban and rural population (Tayside) in Scotland in the period&#10;from August 2020 to July 2021, with fine scale geographical and&#10;socio&#45;demographic metadata. Comparing periods in versus out of &quot;lockdown&quot;&#10;restrictions, we show using genetic distance relationships that individuals&#10;from more deprived areas are more likely to get infected during lockdown but&#10;less likely to spread the infection further. As disadvantaged communities were&#10;the most affected by both COVID&#45;19 and its restrictions, our finding has&#10;important implications for informing future approaches to control future&#10;pandemics driven by similar respiratory infections.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10436v1) |&#10;| A study of pure multi&#45;strange hadrons production in Pb+Pb collisions at&#10; &#160;LHC energies using HYDJET++ model | Gauri Devi, B.

Singh | &#160;&#160;For the present work, we have used the HYDJET++ model to explore the&#10;production of pure multi&#45;strange hadrons in Pb+Pb collisions at&#10;$sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 2.76 TeV and $sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 5.02 TeV collision energies,&#10;respectively. We have simulated the $p_{T}$&#45;spectra and elliptic flow ($v_{2}$)&#10;of $phi$&#45;meson and $Omega$&#45;baryons comparing our results with ALICE&#10;experimental data and several phenomenological models (HIJING/$Boverline{B}$,&#10;VISHNU, EPOS, AMPT, and Krakow) across various centrality intervals.&#10;Additionally, we have calculated the nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$ and&#10;$R_{CP}$), which provide a perception of jet quenching phenomena. Hence, our&#10;findings enable the study of the energy and system dependence of $phi$ and&#10;$Omega$ hadrons production over a wide range of ultra&#45;relativistic collision&#10;energies. We also present the particle ratios ($Omega/phi$,&#10;$overline{Omega}^{+}/Omega^{&#45;}$, $Omega/pi$, and $phi/pi$), offering&#10;insights on the strangeness enhancement and chemical properties of the medium&#10;at both LHC collision energies.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10435v1) |&#10;| Magnetic metamaterials by ion&#45;implantation | Christina Vantaraki, Petter Ström, Tuan T.

Synthesis is accomplished by&#10;combining electron&#45;beam lithography, used to generate nanometric patterned&#10;masks, with ion implantation in thin films. By implanting $^{56}$Fe$^{+}$ ions,&#10;we are able to introduce magnetic functionality in a controlled manner into&#10;continuous Pd thin films, achieving 3D spatial resolution down to a few tens of&#10;nanometers. Our results demonstrate the successful application of this&#10;technique in fabricating square artificial spin ice lattices, which exhibit&#10;well&#45;defined magnetization textures and interactions among the patterned&#10;magnetic elements.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10433v1) |&#10;| Structure&#45;preserving learning for multi&#45;symplectic PDEs | Süleyman Yıldız, Pawan Goyal, Peter Benner | &#160;&#160;This paper presents an energy&#45;preserving machine learning method for&#10;inferring reduced&#45;order models (ROMs) by exploiting the multi&#45;symplectic form&#10;of partial differential equations (PDEs). The vast majority of&#10;energy&#45;preserving reduced&#45;order methods use symplectic Galerkin projection to&#10;construct reduced&#45;order Hamiltonian models by projecting the full models onto a&#10;symplectic subspace. However, symplectic projection requires the existence of&#10;fully discrete operators, and in many cases, such as black&#45;box PDE solvers,&#10;these operators are inaccessible. In this work, we propose an energy&#45;preserving&#10;machine learning method that can infer the dynamics of the given PDE using data&#10;only, so that the proposed framework does not depend on the fully discrete&#10;operators. In this context, the proposed method is non&#45;intrusive. The proposed&#10;method is grey box in the sense that it requires only some basic knowledge of&#10;the multi&#45;symplectic model at the partial differential equation level. We prove&#10;that the proposed method satisfies spatially discrete local energy conservation&#10;and preserves the multi&#45;symplectic conservation laws. We test our method on the&#10;linear wave equation, the Korteweg&#45;de Vries equation, and the&#10;Zakharov&#45;Kuznetsov equation. We test the generalization of our learned models&#10;by testing them far outside the training time interval.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10432v1) |&#10;| Hippocampal synchronization in a realistic CA1 neuron model | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore | &#160;&#160;This work delves into studying the synchronization in two realistic neuron&#10;models using Hodgkin&#45;Huxley dynamics. Unlike simplistic point&#45;like models,&#10;excitatory synapses are here randomly distributed along the dendrites,&#10;introducing strong stochastic contributions into their signal propagation. To&#10;focus on the role of different excitatory positions, we use two copies of the&#10;same neuron whose synapses are located at different distances from the soma and&#10;are exposed to identical Poissonian distributed current pulses. The&#10;synchronization is investigated through a specifically defined spiking&#10;correlation function, and its behavior is analyzed as a function of several&#10;parameters: inhibition weight, distance from the soma of one synaptic group,&#10;excitatory inactivation delay, and weight of the excitatory synapses.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10431v1) |&#10;| Meta&#45;Whisper: Speech&#45;Based Meta&#45;ICL for ASR on Low&#45;Resource Languages | Ming&#45;Hao Hsu, Kuan Po Huang, Hung&#45;yi Lee | &#160;&#160;This paper presents Meta&#45;Whisper, a novel approach to improve automatic&#10;speech recognition (ASR) for low&#45;resource languages using the Whisper model.

This approach mitigates risks&#10;associated with compromised or untrusted devices, common in traditional quantum&#10;communication.&#10; &#160;In this paper, we propose the first of its kind DI&#45;QSDC protocol with user&#10;identity authentication. This ensures the authenticity of both the sender and&#10;receiver prior to message exchange. We then discuss the security of the&#10;proposed protocol against common attacks, demonstrating that no eavesdropper&#10;gains any information from either the quantum or the classical channel. Next,&#10;we implement the protocol on IBM&#39;s quantum hardware and evaluate its&#10;performance in a realistic noisy environment. Additionally, by simulating&#10;common attack models, we showcase that the protocol is secure against any&#10;eavesdropper in the channel.

Breakdown of&#10;time&#45;reversal symmetry (BTRS) is a hallmark of such dissipative non&#45;equilibrium&#10;dynamics. We introduce a robust, experimentally accessible, noninvasive,&#10;quantitative measure of BTRS in terms of the Kullback&#45;Leibler divergence in&#10;collision events, demonstrated in our novel artificial active matter, comprised&#10;of battery&#45;powered spherical rolling robots whose energetics in different modes&#10;of motion can be measured with high precision. Our dimensionless measure&#10;characterizes how dissipation and internal energetics are influenced by&#10;kinematic constraints from interactions with the environment. We propose this&#10;measure of BTRS as an empirical estimate of the distance from equilibrium. An&#10;energetic insight into this departure of active matter from equilibrium comes&#10;from our demonstration of a non&#45;trivial fluctuation symmetry, which reveals a&#10;potentially universal thermodynamic characteristic of active energetics. As a&#10;many&#45;body consequence of BTRS in our experimental active system, we demonstrate&#10;the emergence of activity&#45;induced herding, which has no equilibrium analogue.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10425v1) |&#10;| Unveiling V Modes: Enhancing CMB Sensitivity to BSM Physics with a&#10; &#160;Non&#45;Ideal Half&#45;Wave Plate | N. Raffuzzi, M. Lembo, S. Giardiello, M. Gerbino, M. Lattanzi, P. Natoli, L. Pagano | &#160;&#160;V&#45;mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background is expected to be&#10;vanishingly small in the $Lambda$CDM model and, hence, usually ignored.&#10;Nonetheless, several astrophysical effects, as well as beyond standard model&#10;physics could produce it at a detectable level. A realistic half&#45;wave plate &#45;&#10;an optical element commonly used in CMB experiments to modulate the polarized&#10;signal &#45; can provide sensitivity to V modes without significantly spoiling that&#10;to linear polarization. We assess this sensitivity for some new&#45;generation CMB&#10;experiments, such as the LiteBIRD satellite, the ground&#45;based Simons&#10;Observatory and a CMB&#45;S4&#45;like experiment. We forecast the efficiency of these&#10;experiments to constrain the phenomenology of certain classes of BSM models&#10;inducing mixing of linear polarization states and generation of V modes in the&#10;CMB. We find that new&#45;generation experiments can improve current limits by&#10;1&#45;to&#45;3 orders of magnitude, depending on the data combination. The inclusion of&#10;V&#45;mode information dramatically boosts the sensitivity to these BSM models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10424v1) |&#10;| Initial data for a deformed isolated horizon | Aleš Flandera, David Kofroň, Tomáš Ledvinka | &#160;&#160;Within the isolated horizon formalism, we investigate a static axisymmetric&#10;space&#45;time of a black hole influenced by matter in its neighborhood. To&#10;illustrate the role of ingredients and assumptions in this formalism, we first&#10;show how, in spherical symmetry, the field equations and gauge conditions imply&#10;the isolated horizon initial data leading to the Schwarzschild space&#45;time.&#10;Then, we construct the initial data for a static axisymmetric isolated horizon&#10;representing a deformed black hole. The space&#45;time description in the&#10;Bondi&#45;like coordinates is then found as a series expansion in the vicinity of&#10;the horizon. To graphically illustrate this construction, we also find a&#10;numerical solution for a black hole deformed by a particular analytic model of&#10;a thin accretion disk.

However,&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methods ignore a potentially valuable source of unsupervised&#10;semantic information &#45;&#45; spatial registration transforms between image volumes.&#10;To address this, we propose CCT&#45;R, a contrastive cross&#45;teaching framework&#10;incorporating registration information. To leverage the semantic information&#10;available in registrations between volume pairs, CCT&#45;R incorporates two&#10;proposed modules: Registration Supervision Loss (RSL) and Registration&#45;Enhanced&#10;Positive Sampling (REPS). The RSL leverages segmentation knowledge derived from&#10;transforms between labeled and unlabeled volume pairs, providing an additional&#10;source of pseudo&#45;labels. REPS enhances contrastive learning by identifying&#10;anatomically&#45;corresponding positives across volumes using registration&#10;transforms.

A number of recent methods have shown&#10;how to perform high&#45;dimensional, unbinned unfolding using machine learning.&#10;However, one of the assumptions in all of these methods is that the detector&#10;response is accurately modeled in the Monte Carlo simulation. In practice, the&#10;detector response depends on a number of nuisance parameters that can be&#10;constrained with data.

Given a text query, RGS&#10;determines a stable grasp pose to manipulate the referred object in the robot&#39;s&#10;workspace. RGS comprises two steps: visual grounding and grasp pose estimation.&#10;Recent studies leverage powerful Vision&#45;Language Models (VLMs) for visually&#10;grounding free&#45;flowing natural language in real&#45;world robotic execution.&#10;However, comparisons in complex, cluttered environments with multiple instances&#10;of the same object are lacking. This paper introduces HiFi&#45;CS, featuring&#10;hierarchical application of Featurewise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to fuse image&#10;and text embeddings, enhancing visual grounding for complex attribute rich text&#10;queries encountered in robotic grasping. Visual grounding associates an object&#10;in 2D/3D space with natural language input and is studied in two scenarios:&#10;Closed and Open Vocabulary. HiFi&#45;CS features a lightweight decoder combined&#10;with a frozen VLM and outperforms competitive baselines in closed vocabulary&#10;settings while being 100x smaller in size. Our model can effectively guide&#10;open&#45;set object detectors like GroundedSAM to enhance open&#45;vocabulary&#10;performance. We validate our approach through real&#45;world RGS experiments using&#10;a 7&#45;DOF robotic arm, achieving 90.33% visual grounding accuracy in 15 tabletop&#10;scenes.

Papoutsis, I. E. Papadakis, C. Panagiotou, M. Dovčiak, E. Kammoun | &#160;&#160;Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to be variable across all&#10;wavelengths. Significant observational efforts have been invested in the last&#10;decade in studying their ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability. Long and&#10;densely sampled, multi&#45;wavelength monitoring campaigns of numerous Seyfert&#10;galaxies have been conducted with the aim of determining the X&#45;ray/UV/optical&#10;continuum time lags. Time&#45;lag studies can be used to constrain theoretical&#10;models. The observed time lags can be explained by thermal reprocessing of the&#10;X&#45;rays illuminating the accretion disc (known as the X&#45;ray reverberation&#10;model). However, the observed light curves contain more information that can be&#10;used to further constrain physical models. Our primary objective is to&#10;investigate whether, in addition to time lags, the X&#45;ray reverberation model&#10;can also explain the UV/optical variability amplitude of nearby Seyferts. To do&#10;this, we measured the excess variance of four sources (namely Mrk 509, NGC&#10;4151, NGC 2617, and Mrk 142) as a function of wavelength using data from&#10;archival long, multi&#45;wavelength campaigns with Swift, and ground&#45;based&#10;telescopes. We also computed the model excess variance in the case of the X&#45;ray&#10;reverberation model by determining the disc&#39;s transfer function and assuming a&#10;bending power law for the X&#45;ray power spectrum. We tested the validity of the&#10;model by comparing the measured and model variances for a range of accretion&#10;rates and X&#45;ray source heights. We conclude that the X&#45;ray thermal&#10;reverberation model can fit both the continuum, UV/optical time lags, as well&#10;as the variance in these AGNs, for the same physical parameters. Our results&#10;suggest that the accretion disc is constant and that all the observed&#10;UV/optical variations, on timescales of days and up to a few weeks, can be&#10;fully explained by the variable X&#45;rays as they illuminate the accretion disc.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10417v1) |&#10;| Local central limit theorem for Mallows measure | Alexey Bufetov, Kailun Chen | &#160;&#160;We study the statistics of the Mallows measure on permutations in the limit&#10;pioneered by Starr (2009).

Such walks, inspired by Ising&#45;like models and&#10;opinions dynamics models, are usually considered in one&#45;dimensional virtual&#10;spaces. Here, the mapping is done in such a way that the walk is directed along&#10;the $y$ axis while it can move either way along the $x$ axis. We explore the&#10;properties of such walks as the parameter representing the noise in the opinion&#10;dynamics model, responsible for a continuous phase transition, is varied. The&#10;walk features show marked differences as the system crosses the critical point.&#10;The bivariate distribution of the displacements below the critical point is a&#10;modified biased Gaussian function of x and y which is symmetric about the X&#10;axis.&#10; &#160;The marginal probability distributions can be extracted and the scaling forms&#10;of different quantities, showing power law behaviour, are obtained. The&#10;directed nature of the walk is reflected in the marginal distributions as well&#10;as in the exponents.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10413v1) |&#10;| A Large&#45;Scale Privacy Assessment of Android Third&#45;Party SDKs | Mark Huasong Meng, Chuan Yan, Yun Hao, Qing Zhang, Zeyu Wang, Kailong Wang, Sin Gee Teo, Guangdong Bai, Jin Song Dong | &#160;&#160;Third&#45;party Software Development Kits (SDKs) are widely adopted in Android&#10;app development, to effortlessly accelerate development pipelines and enhance&#10;app functionality. However, this convenience raises substantial concerns about&#10;unauthorized access to users&#39; privacy&#45;sensitive information, which could be&#10;further abused for illegitimate purposes like user tracking or monetization.&#10;Our study offers a targeted analysis of user privacy protection among Android&#10;third&#45;party SDKs, filling a critical gap in the Android software supply chain.&#10;It focuses on two aspects of their privacy practices, including data&#10;exfiltration and behavior&#45;policy compliance (or privacy compliance), utilizing&#10;techniques of taint analysis and large language models. It covers 158&#10;widely&#45;used SDKs from two key SDK release platforms, the official one and a&#10;large alternative one. From them, we identified 338 instances of privacy data&#10;exfiltration. On the privacy compliance, our study reveals that more than 30%&#10;of the examined SDKs fail to provide a privacy policy to disclose their data&#10;handling practices. Among those that provide privacy policies, 37% of them&#10;over&#45;collect user data, and 88% falsely claim access to sensitive data. We&#10;revisit the latest versions of the SDKs after 12 months. Our analysis&#10;demonstrates a persistent lack of improvement in these concerning trends. Based&#10;on our findings, we propose three actionable recommendations to mitigate the&#10;privacy leakage risks and enhance privacy protection for Android users. Our&#10;research not only serves as an urgent call for industry attention but also&#10;provides crucial insights for future regulatory interventions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10411v1) |&#10;| A point process approach for the classification of noisy calcium imaging&#10; &#160;data | Arianna Burzacchi, Nicoletta D&#39;Angelo, David Payares&#45;Garcia, Jorge Mateu | &#160;&#160;We study noisy calcium imaging data, with a focus on the classification of&#10;spike traces. As raw traces obscure the true temporal structure of neuron&#39;s&#10;activity, we performed a tuned filtering of the calcium concentration using two&#10;methods: a biophysical model and a kernel mapping. The former characterizes&#10;spike trains related to a particular triggering event, while the latter filters&#10;out the signal and refines the selection of the underlying neuronal response.&#10;Transitioning from traditional time series analysis to point process theory,&#10;the study explores spike&#45;time distance metrics and point pattern prototypes to&#10;describe repeated observations. We assume that the analyzed neuron&#39;s firing&#10;events, i.e. spike occurrences, are temporal point process events. In&#10;particular, the study aims to categorize 47 point patterns by depth, assuming&#10;the similarity of spike occurrences within specific depth categories. The&#10;results highlight the pivotal roles of depth and stimuli in discerning diverse&#10;temporal structures of neuron firing events, confirming the point process&#10;approach based on prototype analysis is largely useful in the classification of&#10;spike traces.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10409v1) |&#10;| Variational closures for composite homogenised fluid flows | Theo Diamantakis, Ruiao Hu | &#160;&#160;The Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport is a variational formulation of&#10;stochastic fluid dynamics introduced to model the effects of unresolved scales,&#10;whilst preserving the geometric structure of ideal fluid flows. In this work,&#10;we show that the SALT equations can arise from the decomposition of the fluid&#10;flow map into its mean and fluctuating components. The fluctuating component is&#10;realised as a prescribed stochastic diffeomorphism that introduces stochastic&#10;transport into the system and we construct it using homogenisation theory. The&#10;dynamics of the mean component are derived from a variational principle&#10;utilising particular forms of variations that preserve the composite structure&#10;of the flow. Using a new variational principle, we show that SALT equations can&#10;arise from random Lagrangians and are equivalent to random coefficient PDEs. We&#10;also demonstrate how to modify the composite flow and the associated&#10;variational principle to derive models inspired by the Lagrangian Averaged&#10;Euler&#45;Poincare (LAEP) theory.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10408v1) |&#10;| Bitcoin Transaction Behavior Modeling Based on Balance Data | Yu Zhang, Claudio Tessone | &#160;&#160;When analyzing Bitcoin users&#39; balance distribution, we observed that it&#10;follows a log&#45;normal pattern. Drawing parallels from the successful application&#10;of Gibrat&#39;s law of proportional growth in explaining city size and word&#10;frequency distributions, we tested whether the same principle could account for&#10;the log&#45;normal distribution in Bitcoin balances. However, our calculations&#10;revealed that the exponent parameters in both the drift and variance terms&#10;deviate slightly from one. This suggests that Gibrat&#39;s proportional growth rule&#10;alone does not fully explain the log&#45;normal distribution observed in Bitcoin&#10;users&#39; balances. During our exploration, we discovered an intriguing&#10;phenomenon: Bitcoin users tend to fall into two distinct categories based on&#10;their behavior, which we refer to as ``poor&quot; and ``wealthy&quot; users. Poor users,&#10;who initially purchase only a small amount of Bitcoin, tend to buy more&#10;bitcoins first and then sell out all their holdings gradually over time. The&#10;certainty of selling all their coins is higher and higher with time. In&#10;contrast, wealthy users, who acquire a large amount of Bitcoin from the start,&#10;tend to sell off their holdings over time. The speed at which they sell their&#10;bitcoins is lower and lower over time and they will hold at least a small part&#10;of their initial holdings at last. Interestingly, the wealthier the user, the&#10;larger the proportion of their balance and the higher the certainty they tend&#10;to sell. This research provided an interesting perspective to explore bitcoin&#10;users&#39; behaviors which may apply to other finance markets.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10407v1) |&#10;| Stochastic Data&#45;Driven Predictive Control: Chance&#45;Constraint&#10; &#160;Satisfaction with Identified Multi&#45;step Predictors | Haldun Balim, Andrea Carron, Melanie N. Zeilinger, Johannes Köhler | &#160;&#160;We propose a novel data&#45;driven stochastic model predictive control framework&#10;for uncertain linear systems with noisy output measurements. Our approach&#10;leverages multi&#45;step predictors to efficiently propagate uncertainty, ensuring&#10;chance constraint satisfaction with minimal conservatism. In particular, we&#10;present a strategy to identify multi&#45;step predictors and quantify the&#10;associated uncertainty using a surrogate (data&#45;driven) state space model. Then,&#10;we utilize the derived distribution to formulate a constraint tightening that&#10;ensures chance constraint satisfaction. A numerical example highlights the&#10;reduced conservatism of handling parametric uncertainty in the proposed method&#10;compared to state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art solutions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10405v1) |&#10;| A Knowledge&#45;Enhanced Disease Diagnosis Method Based on Prompt Learning&#10; &#160;and BERT Integration | Zhang Zheng | &#160;&#160;This paper proposes a knowledge&#45;enhanced disease diagnosis method based on a&#10;prompt learning framework. The method retrieves structured knowledge from&#10;external knowledge graphs related to clinical cases, encodes it, and injects it&#10;into the prompt templates to enhance the language model&#39;s understanding and&#10;reasoning capabilities for the task.We conducted experiments on three public&#10;datasets: CHIP&#45;CTC, IMCS&#45;V2&#45;NER, and KUAKE&#45;QTR. The results show that the&#10;proposed method significantly outperforms existing models across multiple&#10;evaluation metrics, with an F1 score improvement of 2.4% on the CHIP&#45;CTC&#10;dataset, 3.1% on the IMCS&#45;V2&#45;NER dataset,and 4.2% on the KUAKE&#45;QTR dataset.&#10;Additionally,ablation studies confirmed the critical role of the knowledge&#10;injection module,as the removal of this module resulted in a significant drop&#10;in F1 score. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not&#10;only effectively improves the accuracy of disease diagnosis but also enhances&#10;the interpretability of the predictions, providing more reliable support and&#10;evidence for clinical diagnosis.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10403v1) |&#10;| A Statistical Equilibrium Approach to Adam Smith&#39;s Labor Theory of Value | Ellis Scharfenaker, Bruno Theodosio, Duncan K.

In meiosis II mouse oocytes (developing egg cells) awaiting&#10;fertilisation, the spindle, which is the protein structure responsible for&#10;dividing genetic material in a cell, must maintain its position near the cell&#10;cortex (the thin actin network bound to the cell membrane) for many hours.&#10;However, the cytoplasmic streaming that accompanies this stable positioning&#10;would intuitively appear to destabilise the spindle position. Here, through a&#10;combination of numerical and analytical modelling, we reveal a new,&#10;hydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning beneath the cortical cap.&#10;We show that this stability depends critically on the spindle size and the&#10;active driving from the cortex, and demonstrate that stable spindle positioning&#10;can result purely from a hydrodynamic suction force exerted on the spindle by&#10;the cytoplasmic flow. Our findings show that local fluid dynamic forces can be&#10;sufficient to stabilise the spindle, explaining robustness against&#10;perturbations not only perpendicular but also parallel to the cortex. Our&#10;results shed light on the importance of cytoplasmic streaming in mammalian&#10;meiosis.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10401v1) |&#10;| Sherpa: An Open Source Python Fitting Package | Aneta Siemiginowska, Douglas Burke, Hans Moritz Günther, Nicholas P.

Dejrah | &#160;&#160;We focus on the inflationary predictions of $beta$&#45;exponential potential&#10;models, in which the inflaton is a representation of the field delineating the&#10;size of extra&#45;dimension. Since it offers a well&#45;motivated starting point for&#10;the study of physics at very high energies, we incorporate an $R^2$ term in the&#10;Palatini gravity. In addition, afterward the inflation, the inflaton oscillates&#10;about the minimum of the inflation potential, and reheats the universe. This&#10;occurs during the reheating phase, at which the inflaton decays into the&#10;standard model particles, which fill the universe. We extend our examination by&#10;considering the reheating effects on inflationary observables by employing the&#10;different scenarios of the reheat temperature. Supposing the standard thermal&#10;history after inflation, we display the inflationary predictions, $n_s, r,&#10;mathrm{d}n_s/mathrm{d}&#10;n k$ of $beta$&#45;exponential potential with minimal&#10;coupling in Palatini $R^2$ gravity. Also, different kinds of constraints from a&#10;variety of observations, such as BICEP/Keck, Planck 2018, as well as future&#10;possible detectable sensitivities that might be reached by CMB experiments:&#10;CMB&#45;S4 and LiteBIRD are taken into account in this work. We indicate that our&#10;results are consistent with both the latest data and the future sensitivity&#10;forecasts of LiteBIRD/Planck and CMB&#45;S4. Finally, the results in this study&#10;highlight the viability of our model even in the case of the existence of more&#10;stringent constraints expected from future achievable confidence level limits.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10398v1) |&#10;| Quantifying Observational Projection Effects with a Simulation&#45;based hot&#10; &#160;CGM model | Soumya Shreeram, Johan Comparat, Andrea Merloni, Yi Zhang, Gabriele Ponti, Kirpal Nandra, John ZuHone, Ilaria Marini, Stephan Vladutescu&#45;Zopp, Paola Popesso, Ruediger Pakmor, Riccardo Seppi, Celine Peroux, Daniele Sorini | &#160;&#160;The hot phase of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) allows us to probe the&#10;inflow and outflow of gas within a galaxy, which is responsible for dictating&#10;the evolution of the galaxy. Studying the hot CGM sheds light on a better&#10;understanding of gas physics, which is crucial to inform and constrain&#10;simulation models. With the recent advances in observational measurements&#10;probing the hot CGM in X&#45;rays and tSZ, we have a new avenue for widening our&#10;knowledge of gas physics and feedback by exploiting the information from&#10;current/future observations. In this paper, we use the TNG300 hydrodynamical&#10;simulations to build a fully self&#45;consistent forward model for the hot CGM. We&#10;construct a lightcone and generate mock X&#45;ray observations. We quantify the&#10;projection effects, namely the locally correlated large&#45;scale structure in&#10;X&#45;rays and the effect due to satellite galaxies misclassified as centrals which&#10;affects the measured hot CGM galactocentric profiles in stacking experiments.&#10;We present an analytical model that describes the intrinsic X&#45;ray surface&#10;brightness profile across the stellar and halo mass bins. The increasing&#10;stellar mass bins result in decreasing values of $beta$, the exponent&#10;quantifying the slope of the intrinsic galactocentric profiles. We carry&#10;forward the current state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art by also showing the impact of the locally&#10;correlated environment on the measured X&#45;ray surface brightness profiles. We&#10;also present, for the first time, the effect of misclassified centrals in&#10;stacking experiments for three stellar mass bins: $10^{10.5&#45;11} M_odot$,&#10;$10^{11&#45;11.2} M_odot$, and $10^{11.2&#45;11.5} M_odot$. We find that the&#10;contaminating effect of the misclassified centrals on the stacked profiles&#10;increases when the stellar mass decreases.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10397v1) |&#10;| MOST: MR reconstruction Optimization for multiple downStream Tasks via&#10; &#160;continual learning | Hwihun Jeong, Se Young Chun, Jongho Lee | &#160;&#160;Deep learning&#45;based Magnetic Resonance (MR) reconstruction methods have&#10;focused on generating high&#45;quality images but they often overlook the impact on&#10;downstream tasks (e.g., segmentation) that utilize the reconstructed images.&#10;Cascading separately trained reconstruction network and downstream task network&#10;has been shown to introduce performance degradation due to error propagation&#10;and domain gaps between training datasets. To mitigate this issue, downstream&#10;task&#45;oriented reconstruction optimization has been proposed for a single&#10;downstream task. Expanding this optimization to multi&#45;task scenarios is not&#10;straightforward. In this work, we extended this optimization to sequentially&#10;introduced multiple downstream tasks and demonstrated that a single MR&#10;reconstruction network can be optimized for multiple downstream tasks by&#10;deploying continual learning (MOST). MOST integrated techniques from&#10;replay&#45;based continual learning and image&#45;guided loss to overcome catastrophic&#10;forgetting. Comparative experiments demonstrated that MOST outperformed a&#10;reconstruction network without finetuning, a reconstruction network with&#10;na&quot;ive finetuning, and conventional continual learning methods. This&#10;advancement empowers the application of a single MR reconstruction network for&#10;multiple downstream tasks.

In particular, we analyse the task of&#10;textit{multicopy state teleportation}, where Alice has $k$ identical copies of&#10;an arbitrary unknown $d$&#45;dimensional qudit state $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to teleport&#10;a single copy of $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to Bob using a maximally entangled&#10;two&#45;qudit state shared between Alice and Bob without Bob&#39;s correction. Alice&#10;may perform a joint measurement on her half of the entangled state and the $k$&#10;copies of $vertpsi&#13;angle$. We prove that the maximal probability of success&#10;for teleporting the exact state $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to Bob is&#10;$p(d,k)=frac{k}{d(k&#45;1+d)}$ and present an explicit protocol to attain this&#10;performance. Then, by utilising $k$ copies of an arbitrary target state&#10;$vertpsi&#13;angle$, we show how the multicopy state teleportation protocol can&#10;be employed to enhance the success probability of storage and retrieval of&#10;quantum programs, which aims to universally retrieve the action of an arbitrary&#10;quantum channel that is stored in a state. Our proofs make use of group&#10;representation theory methods, which may find applications beyond the problems&#10;addressed in this work.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10393v1) |&#10;| TPFL: Tsetlin&#45;Personalized Federated Learning with Confidence&#45;Based&#10; &#160;Clustering | Rasoul Jafari Gohari, Laya Aliahmadipour, Ezat Valipour | &#160;&#160;The world of Machine Learning (ML) has witnessed rapid changes in terms of&#10;new models and ways to process users data. The majority of work that has been&#10;done is focused on Deep Learning (DL) based approaches. However, with the&#10;emergence of new algorithms such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm, there&#10;is growing interest in exploring alternative approaches that may offer unique&#10;advantages in certain domains or applications. One of these domains is&#10;Federated Learning (FL), in which users privacy is of utmost importance. Due to&#10;its novelty, FL has seen a surge in the incorporation of personalization&#10;techniques to enhance model accuracy while maintaining user privacy under&#10;personalized conditions. In this work, we propose a novel approach dubbed TPFL:&#10;Tsetlin&#45;Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into&#10;clusters based on their confidence towards a specific class. In this way,&#10;clustering can benefit from two key advantages. Firstly, clients share only&#10;what they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight&#10;aggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been&#10;enough during the training. This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are&#10;non&#45;Independent and Identically Distributed (non&#45;IID). Secondly, by sharing&#10;only weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially&#10;reduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication&#10;cost. The results of TPFL demonstrated the highest accuracy on three different&#10;datasets; namely MNIST, FashionMNIST and FEMNIST.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10392v1) |&#10;| Prompt&#45;and&#45;Transfer: Dynamic Class&#45;aware Enhancement for Few&#45;shot&#10; &#160;Segmentation | Hanbo Bi, Yingchao Feng, Wenhui Diao, Peijin Wang, Yongqiang Mao, Kun Fu, Hongqi Wang, Xian Sun | &#160;&#160;For more efficient generalization to unseen domains (classes), most Few&#45;shot&#10;Segmentation (FSS) would directly exploit pre&#45;trained encoders and only&#10;fine&#45;tune the decoder, especially in the current era of large models. However,&#10;such fixed feature encoders tend to be class&#45;agnostic, inevitably activating&#10;objects that are irrelevant to the target class. In contrast, humans can&#10;effortlessly focus on specific objects in the line of sight. This paper mimics&#10;the visual perception pattern of human beings and proposes a novel and powerful&#10;prompt&#45;driven scheme, called ``Prompt and Transfer&quot; (PAT), which constructs a&#10;dynamic class&#45;aware prompting paradigm to tune the encoder for focusing on the&#10;interested object (target class) in the current task. Three key points are&#10;elaborated to enhance the prompting: 1) Cross&#45;modal linguistic information is&#10;introduced to initialize prompts for each task. 2) Semantic Prompt Transfer&#10;(SPT) that precisely transfers the class&#45;specific semantics within the images&#10;to prompts. 3) Part Mask Generator (PMG) that works in conjunction with SPT to&#10;adaptively generate different but complementary part prompts for different&#10;individuals. Surprisingly, PAT achieves competitive performance on 4 different&#10;tasks including standard FSS, Cross&#45;domain FSS (e.g., CV, medical, and remote&#10;sensing domains), Weak&#45;label FSS, and Zero&#45;shot Segmentation, setting new&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;arts on 11 benchmarks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10389v1) |&#10;| Revising the Structure of Recurrent Neural Networks to Eliminate&#10; &#160;Numerical Derivatives in Forming Physics Informed Loss Terms with Respect to&#10; &#160;Time | Mahyar Jahani&#45;nasab, Mohamad Ali Bijarchi | &#160;&#160;Solving unsteady partial differential equations (PDEs) using recurrent neural&#10;networks (RNNs) typically requires numerical derivatives between each block of&#10;the RNN to form the physics informed loss function. However, this introduces&#10;the complexities of numerical derivatives into the training process of these&#10;models. In this study, we propose modifying the structure of the traditional&#10;RNN to enable the prediction of each block over a time interval, making it&#10;possible to calculate the derivative of the output with respect to time using&#10;the backpropagation algorithm. To achieve this, the time intervals of these&#10;blocks are overlapped, defining a mutual loss function between them.&#10;Additionally, the employment of conditional hidden states enables us to achieve&#10;a unique solution for each block. The forget factor is utilized to control the&#10;influence of the conditional hidden state on the prediction of the subsequent&#10;block. This new model, termed the Mutual Interval RNN (MI&#45;RNN), is applied to&#10;solve three different benchmarks: the Burgers equation, unsteady heat&#10;conduction in an irregular domain, and the Green vortex problem. Our results&#10;demonstrate that MI&#45;RNN can find the exact solution more accurately compared to&#10;existing RNN models. For instance, in the second problem, MI&#45;RNN achieved one&#10;order of magnitude less relative error compared to the RNN model with numerical&#10;derivatives.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10388v1) |&#10;| Sharp decay rate for eigenfunctions of perturbed periodic Schrödinger&#10; &#160;operators | Wencai Liu, Rodrigo Matos, John N.

In particular, transformers use&#10;self&#45; and cross&#45;attention layers which have large memory footprint, while&#10;diffusion models require high inference time. To overcome the above, this paper&#10;explores a novel design of Mamba, an emergent State&#45;Space Model (SSM), called&#10;Mamba&#45;ST, to perform style transfer. To do so, we adapt Mamba linear equation&#10;to simulate the behavior of cross&#45;attention layers, which are able to combine&#10;two separate embeddings into a single output, but drastically reducing memory&#10;usage and time complexity. We modified the Mamba&#39;s inner equations so to accept&#10;inputs from, and combine, two separate data streams. To the best of our&#10;knowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt the equations of SSMs to a vision&#10;task like style transfer without requiring any other module like&#10;cross&#45;attention or custom normalization layers. An extensive set of experiments&#10;demonstrates the superiority and efficiency of our method in performing style&#10;transfer compared to transformers and diffusion models. Results show improved&#10;quality in terms of both ArtFID and FID metrics.

This module employs the Z4c formulation to solve the Einstein&#10;equations. We demonstrate its accuracy through a series of standard numerical&#10;relativity tests, including convergence of the gravitational waveform from&#10;binary black hole coalescence. Furthermore, we conduct scaling tests on OLCF&#10;Frontier and NERSC Perlmutter, where AthenaK exhibits excellent weak scaling&#10;efficiency of 80% on up to 65,536 AMD MI250X GPUs on Frontier (relative to 4&#10;GPUs) and strong scaling efficiencies of 84% and 77% on AMD MI250X and NVIDIA&#10;A100 GPUs on Frontier and Perlmutter respectively. Additionally, we observe a&#10;significant performance boost, with two orders of magnitude speedup ($gtrsim&#10;200times$) on a GPU compared to a single CPU core, affirming that AthenaK is&#10;well&#45;suited for exascale computing, thereby expanding the potential for&#10;breakthroughs in numerical relativity research.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10383v1) |&#10;| J&#45;UBIK: The JAX&#45;accelerated Universal Bayesian Imaging Kit | Vincent Eberle, Matteo Guardiani, Margret Westerkamp, Philipp Frank, Julian Rüstig, Julia Stadler, Torsten A. Enßlin | &#160;&#160;Many advances in astronomy and astrophysics originate from accurate images of&#10;the sky emission across multiple wavelengths. This often requires&#10;reconstructing spatially and spectrally correlated signals detected from&#10;multiple instruments. To facilitate the high&#45;fidelity imaging of these signals,&#10;we introduce the universal Bayesian imaging kit (UBIK). Specifically, we&#10;present J&#45;UBIK, a flexible and modular implementation leveraging the&#10;JAX&#45;accelerated NIFTy.re software as its backend. J&#45;UBIK streamlines the&#10;implementation of the key Bayesian inference components, providing for all the&#10;necessary steps of Bayesian imaging pipelines. First, it provides adaptable&#10;prior models for different sky realizations. Second, it includes likelihood&#10;models tailored to specific instruments. So far, the package includes three&#10;instruments: Chandra and eROSITA for X&#45;ray observations, and the James Webb&#10;Space Telescope (JWST) for the near&#45; and mid&#45;infrared. The aim is to expand&#10;this set in the future. Third, these models can be integrated with various&#10;inference and optimization schemes, such as maximum a posteriori estimation and&#10;variational inference. Explicit demos show how to integrate the individual&#10;modules into a full analysis pipeline. Overall, J&#45;UBIK enables efficient&#10;generation of high&#45;fidelity images via Bayesian pipelines that can be tailored&#10;to specific research objectives.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10381v1) |&#10;| Thermolectricity in irradiated bilayer graphene flakes | Cynthia Ihuoma Osuala, Tanu Choudhary, Raju K. Biswas, Sudin Ganguly, Chunlei Qu, Santanu K. Maiti | &#160;&#160;We present a comprehensive study on enhancing the thermoelectric (TE)&#10;performance of bilayer graphene (BLG) through irradiation with arbitrarily&#10;polarized light, focusing on $AA$&#45; and $AB$&#45;stacked configurations with zigzag&#10;edges. Utilizing a combination of tight&#45;binding theory and density functional&#10;theory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on&#10;electronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the&#10;electronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function,&#10;which significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the&#10;overall {it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT&#10;calculations reveal that $AB$&#45;stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal&#10;conductivity compared to $AA$&#45;stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic&#10;scattering and phonon group velocity. The combined analysis shows that FOM&#10;exceeds unity in both stacking types, with notable improvements near the&#10;irradiation&#45;induced gap. Additionally, we explore the dependence of FOM on the&#10;system dimensions and temperature, demonstrating that light&#45;irradiated BLG&#10;holds great promise for efficient thermoelectric energy conversion and waste&#10;heat recovery. Our results show favorable responses over a wide range of&#10;irradiation parameters. These findings provide crucial insights into optimizing&#10;BLG for advanced TE applications through light&#45;induced modifications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10380v1) |&#10;| Leveraging Joint Spectral and Spatial Learning with MAMBA for&#10; &#160;Multichannel Speech Enhancement | Wenze Ren, Haibin Wu, Yi&#45;Cheng Lin, Xuanjun Chen, Rong Chao, Kuo&#45;Hsuan Hung, You&#45;Jin Li, Wen&#45;Yuan Ting, Hsin&#45;Min Wang, Yu Tsao | &#160;&#160;In multichannel speech enhancement, effectively capturing spatial and&#10;spectral information across different microphones is crucial for noise&#10;reduction. Traditional methods, such as CNN or LSTM, attempt to model the&#10;temporal dynamics of full&#45;band and sub&#45;band spectral and spatial features.&#10;However, these approaches face limitations in fully modeling complex temporal&#10;dependencies, especially in dynamic acoustic environments. To overcome these&#10;challenges, we modify the current advanced model McNet by introducing an&#10;improved version of Mamba, a state&#45;space model, and further propose MCMamba.&#10;MCMamba has been completely reengineered to integrate full&#45;band and narrow&#45;band&#10;spatial information with sub&#45;band and full&#45;band spectral features, providing a&#10;more comprehensive approach to modeling spatial and spectral information. Our&#10;experimental results demonstrate that MCMamba significantly improves the&#10;modeling of spatial and spectral features in multichannel speech enhancement,&#10;outperforming McNet and achieving state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art performance on the CHiME&#45;3&#10;dataset. Additionally, we find that Mamba performs exceptionally well in&#10;modeling spectral information.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10376v1) |&#10;| Nonlinear Causality in Brain Networks: With Application to Motor Imagery&#10; &#160;vs Execution | Sipan Aslan, Hernando Ombao | &#160;&#160;One fundamental challenge of data&#45;driven analysis in neuroscience is modeling&#10;causal interactions and exploring the connectivity of nodes in a brain network.&#10;Various statistical methods, relying on various perspectives and employing&#10;different data modalities, are being developed to examine and comprehend the&#10;underlying causal structures inherent to brain dynamics. This study introduces&#10;a novel statistical approach, TAR4C, to dissect causal interactions in&#10;multichannel EEG recordings. TAR4C uses the threshold autoregressive model to&#10;describe the causal interaction between nodes or clusters of nodes in a brain&#10;network. The perspective involves testing whether one node, which may represent&#10;a brain region, can control the dynamics of the other. The node that has such&#10;an impact on the other is called a threshold variable and can be classified as&#10;a causative because its functionality is the leading source operating as an&#10;instantaneous switching mechanism that regulates the time&#45;varying&#10;autoregressive structure of the other. This statistical concept is commonly&#10;referred to as threshold non&#45;linearity. Once threshold non&#45;linearity has been&#10;verified between a pair of nodes, the subsequent essential facet of TAR&#10;modeling is to assess the predictive ability of the causal node for the current&#10;activity on the other and represent causal interactions in autoregressive&#10;terms. This predictive ability is what underlies Granger causality. The TAR4C&#10;approach can discover non&#45;linear and time&#45;dependent causal interactions without&#10;negating the G&#45;causality perspective. The efficacy of the proposed approach is&#10;exemplified by analyzing the EEG signals recorded during the motor&#10;movement/imagery experiment. The similarities and differences between the&#10;causal interactions manifesting during the execution and the imagery of a given&#10;motor movement are demonstrated by analyzing EEG recordings from multiple&#10;subjects.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10374v1) |&#10;| Instigating Cooperation among LLM Agents Using Adaptive Information&#10; &#160;Modulation | Qiliang Chen, &#160;Alireza, &#160;Ilami, Nunzio Lore, Babak Heydari | &#160;&#160;This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for&#10;human strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these&#10;agents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments. Our&#10;approach extends traditional agent&#45;based simulations by using strategic LLM&#10;agents (SLA) and introducing dynamic and adaptive governance through a&#10;pro&#45;social promoting RL agent (PPA) that modulates information access across&#10;agents in a network, optimizing social welfare and promoting pro&#45;social&#10;behavior. Through validation in iterative games, including the prisoner&#10;dilemma, we demonstrate that SLA agents exhibit nuanced strategic adaptations.&#10;The PPA agent effectively learns to adjust information transparency, resulting&#10;in enhanced cooperation rates. This framework offers significant insights into&#10;AI&#45;mediated social dynamics, contributing to the deployment of AI in real&#45;world&#10;team settings.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10372v1) |&#10;| Learning Gentle Grasping from Human&#45;Free Force Control Demonstration | Mingxuan Li, Lunwei Zhang, Tiemin Li, Yao Jiang | &#160;&#160;Humans can steadily and gently grasp unfamiliar objects based on tactile&#10;perception. Robots still face challenges in achieving similar performance due&#10;to the difficulty of learning accurate grasp&#45;force predictions and force&#10;control strategies that can be generalized from limited data. In this article,&#10;we propose an approach for learning grasping from ideal force control&#10;demonstrations, to achieve similar performance of human hands with limited data&#10;size. Our approach utilizes objects with known contact characteristics to&#10;automatically generate reference force curves without human demonstrations. In&#10;addition, we design the dual convolutional neural networks (Dual&#45;CNN)&#10;architecture which incorporating a physics&#45;based mechanics module for learning&#10;target grasping force predictions from demonstrations. The described method can&#10;be effectively applied in vision&#45;based tactile sensors and enables gentle and&#10;stable grasping of objects from the ground. The described prediction model and&#10;grasping strategy were validated in offline evaluations and online experiments,&#10;and the accuracy and generalizability were demonstrated.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10371v1) |&#10;| Uncovering the Mechanism of Hepatotoxiciy of PFAS Targeting L&#45;FABP Using&#10; &#160;GCN and Computational Modeling | Lucas Jividen, Tibo Duran, Xi&#45;Zhi Niu, Jun Bai | &#160;&#160;Per&#45; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental&#10;pollutants with known toxicity and bioaccumulation issues. Their widespread&#10;industrial use and resistance to degradation have led to global environmental&#10;contamination and significant health concerns. While a minority of PFAS have&#10;been extensively studied, the toxicity of many PFAS remains poorly understood&#10;due to limited direct toxicological data. This study advances the predictive&#10;modeling of PFAS toxicity by combining semi&#45;supervised graph convolutional&#10;networks (GCNs) with molecular descriptors and fingerprints. We propose a novel&#10;approach to enhance the prediction of PFAS binding affinities by isolating&#10;molecular fingerprints to construct graphs where then descriptors are set as&#10;the node features. This approach specifically captures the structural,&#10;physicochemical, and topological features of PFAS without overfitting due to an&#10;abundance of features. Unsupervised clustering then identifies representative&#10;compounds for detailed binding studies. Our results provide a more accurate&#10;ability to estimate PFAS hepatotoxicity to provide guidance in chemical&#10;discovery of new PFAS and the development of new safety regulations.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10370v1) |&#10;| Stochastic Control of UAVs: An Optimal Tradeoff between Performance,&#10; &#160;Flight Smoothness and Control Effort | George Rapakoulias, Panagiotis Tsiotras | &#160;&#160;Safe and accurate control of unmanned aerial vehicles in the presence of&#10;winds is a challenging control problem due to the hard&#45;to&#45;model and highly&#10;stochastic nature of the disturbance forces acting upon the vehicle. To meet&#10;performance constraints, state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art control methods such as Incremental&#10;Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) or other adaptive control techniques require&#10;high control gains to mitigate the effects of uncertainty entering the system.&#10;While achieving good tracking performance, IDNI requires excessive control&#10;effort, results in high actuator strain, and reduced flight smoothness due to&#10;constant and aggressive corrective actions commanded by the controller. In this&#10;paper, we propose a novel control architecture that allows the user to&#10;systematically address the trade&#45;off between high authority control and&#10;performance constraint satisfaction. Our approach consists of two parts. To&#10;cancel out biases introduced by unmodelled aerodynamic effects we propose a&#10;hybrid, model&#45;based disturbance force estimator augmented with a neural&#10;network, that can adapt to external wind conditions using a Kalman Filter. We&#10;then utilize state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art results from Covariance Steering theory, which&#10;offers a principled way of controlling the uncertainty of the tracking error&#10;dynamics. We first analyze the properties of the combined system and then&#10;provide extensive experimental results to verify the advantages of the proposed&#10;approach over existing methods&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10369v1) |&#10;| Integrated nowcasting of convective precipitation with Transformer&#45;based&#10; &#160;models using multi&#45;source data | Çağlar Küçük, Aitor Atencia, Markus Dabernig | &#160;&#160;Precipitation nowcasting is crucial for mitigating the impacts of severe&#10;weather events and supporting daily activities. Conventional models&#10;predominantly relying on radar data have limited performance in predicting&#10;cases with complex temporal features such as convection initiation,&#10;highlighting the need to integrate data from other sources for more&#10;comprehensive nowcasting. Unlike physics&#45;based models, machine learning&#10;(ML)&#45;based models offer promising solutions for efficiently integrating large&#10;volumes of diverse data. We present EF4INCA, a spatiotemporal Transformer model&#10;for precipitation nowcasting that integrates satellite&#45; and ground&#45;based&#10;observations with numerical weather prediction outputs. EF4INCA provides&#10;high&#45;resolution forecasts over Austria, accurately predicting the location and&#10;shape of precipitation fields with a spatial resolution of 1 kilometre and a&#10;temporal resolution of 5 minutes, up to 90 minutes ahead. Our evaluation shows&#10;that EF4INCA outperforms conventional nowcasting models, including the&#10;operational model of Austria, particularly in scenarios with complex temporal&#10;features such as convective initiation and rapid weather changes. EF4INCA&#10;maintains higher accuracy in location forecasting but generates smoother fields&#10;at later prediction times compared to traditional models. Interpretation of our&#10;model showed that precipitation products and SEVIRI infrared channels CH7 and&#10;CH9 are the most important data streams. These results underscore the&#10;importance of combining data from different domains, including physics&#45;based&#10;model products, with ML approaches. Our study highlights the robustness of&#10;EF4INCA and its potential for improved precipitation nowcasting. We provide&#10;access to our code repository, model weights, and the dataset curated for&#10;benchmarking, facilitating further development and application.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10367v1) |&#10;&#10;">

Hill, Matthias Kluge, Martin Landriau, Ximena Mazzalay, Eva Noyola, Taniya Parikh, Jan Snigula | &#160;&#160;We analyse the stellar structure of a sample of dwarf ellipticals (dE)&#10;inhabiting various environments within the Virgo cluster. Integral&#45;field&#10;observations with a high spectral resolution allow us to robustly determine&#10;their low velocity dispersions ($sim25$ km s$^{&#45;1}$) and higher&#45;order&#10;kinematic moments out to the half&#45;light radius. We find the dEs exhibit a&#10;diversity in ages with the younger dEs being less enhanced than the older,&#10;suggesting a complex star formation history for those dEs that recently entered&#10;Virgo while others have been quenched shortly after reionization.&#10;Orbit&#45;superposition modeling allowed us to recover viewing angles, stellar&#10;mass&#45;to&#45;light ratios (with gradients), as well as the intrinsic orbit&#10;structure. We find that the angular momentum of the dEs is strongly suppressed&#10;compared to ordinary early&#45;type galaxies and correlates with the environment.&#10;Flattened dEs are so because of a suppressed kinetic energy perpendicular to&#10;their equatorial plane. Combining population and dynamical modeling results, we&#10;find an age&#45;dependent stellar initial mass function (IMF) or, alternatively,&#10;evidence for a more extended star formation history for those galaxies that&#10;have had higher initial mass and/or inhabited lower density environments. dEs&#10;appear to have a spatially homogeneous stellar structure but the state they&#10;were `frozen&#39; in as they stopped forming stars varies dramatically according to&#10;their initial conditions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10518v1) |&#10;| RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long&#45;Context LLM Inference via Vector&#10; &#160;Retrieval | Di Liu, Meng Chen, Baotong Lu, Huiqiang Jiang, Zhenhua Han, Qianxi Zhang, Qi Chen, Chengruidong Zhang, Bailu Ding, Kai Zhang, Chen Chen, Fan Yang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu | &#160;&#160;Transformer&#45;based large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly important&#10;in various domains. However, the quadratic time complexity of attention&#10;operation poses a significant challenge for scaling to longer contexts due to&#10;the extremely high inference latency and GPU memory consumption for caching&#10;key&#45;value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training&#45;free&#10;approach to accelerate attention computation. To leverage the dynamic sparse&#10;property of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor&#10;search (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most&#10;relevant ones via vector search during generation. Due to the&#10;out&#45;of&#45;distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors, off&#45;the&#45;shelf&#10;ANNS indexes still need to scan O(N) (usually 30% of all keys) data for&#10;accurate retrieval, which fails to exploit the high sparsity.&#10;RetrievalAttention first identifies the OOD challenge of ANNS&#45;based attention,&#10;and addresses it via an attention&#45;aware vector search algorithm that can adapt&#10;to queries and only access 1&#45;&#45;3% of data, thus achieving a sub&#45;linear time&#10;complexity. RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of&#10;long&#45;context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the&#10;model accuracy. Especially, RetrievalAttention only needs 16GB GPU memory for&#10;serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating&#10;one token in 0.188 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB).&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516v1) |&#10;| An Efficient Self&#45;Learning Framework For Interactive Spoken Dialog&#10; &#160;Systems | Hitesh Tulsiani, David M. Chan, Shalini Ghosh, Garima Lalwani, Prabhat Pandey, Ankish Bansal, Sri Garimella, Ariya Rastrow, Björn Hoffmeister | &#160;&#160;Dialog systems, such as voice assistants, are expected to engage with users&#10;in complex, evolving conversations. Unfortunately, traditional automatic speech&#10;recognition (ASR) systems deployed in such applications are usually trained to&#10;recognize each turn independently and lack the ability to adapt to the&#10;conversational context or incorporate user feedback. In this work, we introduce&#10;a general framework for ASR in dialog systems that can go beyond learning from&#10;single&#45;turn utterances and learn over time how to adapt to both explicit&#10;supervision and implicit user feedback present in multi&#45;turn conversations. We&#10;accomplish that by leveraging advances in student&#45;teacher learning and&#10;context&#45;aware dialog processing, and designing contrastive self&#45;supervision&#10;approaches with Ohm, a new online hard&#45;negative mining approach. We show that&#10;leveraging our new framework compared to traditional training leads to relative&#10;WER reductions of close to 10% in real&#45;world dialog systems, and up to 26% on&#10;public synthetic data.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10515v1) |&#10;| Constraints on axions from patchy screening of the cosmic microwave&#10; &#160;background | Samuel Goldstein, Fiona McCarthy, Cristina Mondino, J. Colin Hill, Junwu Huang, Matthew C. Johnson | &#160;&#160;The resonant conversion of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons into&#10;axions within large&#45;scale structure induces an anisotropic spectral distortion&#10;in CMB temperature maps. Applying state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art foreground cleaning&#10;techniques to $textit{Planck}$ CMB observations, we construct maps of&#10;axion&#45;induced &quot;patchy screening&quot; of the CMB. We cross&#45;correlate these maps with&#10;data from the $textit{unWISE}$ galaxy survey and find no evidence of axions.&#10;We constrain the axion&#45;photon coupling, $g_{agammagamma} &#10;esssim 2 times&#10;10^{&#45;12}~{&#13;m GeV}^{&#45;1}$, at the 95% confidence level for axion masses in the&#10;range $10^{&#45;13}~{&#13;m eV} &#10;esssim m_a &#10;esssim 10^{&#45;12}~{&#13;m eV}$. These&#10;constraints are competitive with the tightest astrophysical axion limits in&#10;this mass range and are inferred from robust population&#45;level statistics, which&#10;makes them complementary to existing searches that rely on modeling of&#10;individual systems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10514v1) |&#10;| Weak Superimposed Codes of Improved Asymptotic Rate and Their Randomized&#10; &#160;Construction | Yu Tsunoda, Yuichiro Fujiwara | &#160;&#160;Weak superimposed codes are combinatorial structures related closely to&#10;generalized cover&#45;free families, superimposed codes, and disjunct matrices in&#10;that they are only required to satisfy similar but less stringent conditions.&#10;This class of codes may also be seen as a stricter variant of what are known as&#10;locally thin families in combinatorics. Originally, weak superimposed codes&#10;were introduced in the context of multimedia content protection against illegal&#10;distribution of copies under the assumption that a coalition of malicious users&#10;may employ the averaging attack with adversarial noise. As in many other kinds&#10;of codes in information theory, it is of interest and importance in the study&#10;of weak superimposed codes to find the highest achievable rate in the&#10;asymptotic regime and give an efficient construction that produces an infinite&#10;sequence of codes that achieve it. Here, we prove a tighter lower bound than&#10;the sharpest known one on the rate of optimal weak superimposed codes and give&#10;a polynomial&#45;time randomized construction algorithm for codes that&#10;asymptotically attain our improved bound with high probability. Our&#10;probabilistic approach is versatile and applicable to many other related codes&#10;and arrays.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10511v1) |&#10;| Pennsieve &#45; A Collaborative Platform for Translational Neuroscience and&#10; &#160;Beyond | Zack Goldblum, Zhongchuan Xu, Haoer Shi, Patryk Orzechowski, Jamaal Spence, Kathryn A Davis, Brian Litt, Nishant Sinha, Joost Wagenaar | &#160;&#160;The exponential growth of neuroscientific data necessitates platforms that&#10;facilitate data management and multidisciplinary collaboration. In this paper,&#10;we introduce Pennsieve &#45; an open&#45;source, cloud&#45;based scientific data management&#10;platform built to meet these needs. Pennsieve supports complex multimodal&#10;datasets and provides tools for data visualization and analyses. It takes a&#10;comprehensive approach to data integration, enabling researchers to define&#10;custom metadata schemas and utilize advanced tools to filter and query their&#10;data. Pennsieve&#39;s modular architecture allows external applications to extend&#10;its capabilities, and collaborative workspaces with peer&#45;reviewed data&#10;publishing mechanisms promote high&#45;quality datasets optimized for downstream&#10;analysis, both in the cloud and on&#45;premises.&#10; &#160;Pennsieve forms the core for major neuroscience research programs including&#10;the NIH SPARC Initiative, NIH HEAL Initiative&#39;s PRECISION Human Pain Network,&#10;and NIH HEAL RE&#45;JOIN Initiative. It serves more than 80 research groups&#10;worldwide, along with several large&#45;scale, inter&#45;institutional projects at&#10;clinical sites through the University of Pennsylvania. Underpinning the&#10;SPARC.Science, Epilepsy.Science, and Pennsieve Discover portals, Pennsieve&#10;stores over 125 TB of scientific data, with 35 TB of data publicly available&#10;across more than 350 high&#45;impact datasets. It adheres to the findable,&#10;accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) principles of data sharing and&#10;is recognized as one of the NIH&#45;approved Data Repositories.

Specifically, we investigate the role of resistivity&#10;in the dynamical evolution of neutron stars over a period of up to 100 ms and&#10;its effects on their quasi&#45;equilibrium configurations. Our results demonstrate&#10;that resistivity can significantly influence the development of&#10;magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, resulting in markedly different magnetic&#10;field geometries. Additionally, resistivity suppresses the growth of these&#10;instabilities, leading to a reduction in the amplitude of emitted gravitational&#10;waves. Despite the variations in magnetic field geometries, the ratio of&#10;poloidal to toroidal field energies remains consistently 9:1 throughout the&#10;simulations, for the models we investigated.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10508v1) |&#10;| Beth&#45;Uhlenbeck equation for the thermodynamics of fluctuations in a&#10; &#160;generalised 2+1D Gross&#45;Neveu model | Biplab Mahato, David Blaschke, Dietmar Ebert | &#160;&#160;We study a generalised version of Gross&#45;Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions. The&#10;model is inspired from graphene which shows a linear dispersion relation near&#10;the Dirac points. The phase structure and the thermodynamic properties in the&#10;mean field approximation have been studied before. Here we go beyond the mean&#10;field level by deriving a Beth&#45;Uhlenbeck equation for Gaussian fluctuations,&#10;solutions of which we explore numerically, for the first time including their&#10;momentum dependence. We discuss the excitonic mass, fluctuation pressure and&#10;phase shifts. We also perform a comparison with the NJL model in 3+1 dimension&#10;and discuss its implication for graphene.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10507v1) |&#10;| Context&#45;aware Code Segmentation for C&#45;to&#45;Rust Translation using Large&#10; &#160;Language Models | Momoko Shiraishi, Takahiro Shinagawa | &#160;&#160;There is strong motivation to translate C code into Rust code due to the&#10;continuing threat of memory safety vulnerabilities in existing C programs and&#10;the significant attention paid to Rust as an alternative to the C language.&#10;While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating this translation&#10;by generating more natural and safer code than rule&#45;based methods, previous&#10;studies have shown that LLM&#45;generated Rust code often fails to compile, even&#10;for relatively small C programs, due to significant differences between the two&#10;languages and context window limitations. We propose an LLM&#45;based translation&#10;scheme that improves the success rate of translating large&#45;scale C code into&#10;compilable Rust code. Our approach involves three key techniques: (1)&#10;pre&#45;processing the C code to better align its structure and expressions with&#10;Rust, (2) segmenting the code into optimally sized translation units to avoid&#10;exceeding the LLM&#39;s context window limits, and (3) iteratively compiling and&#10;repairing errors while maintaining consistency between translation units using&#10;context&#45;supplementing prompts. Compilation success is an essential first step&#10;in achieving functional equivalence, as only compilable code can be further&#10;tested. In experiments with 20 benchmark C programs, including those exceeding&#10;4 kilo lines of code, we successfully translated all programs into compilable&#10;Rust code without losing corresponding parts of the original code.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10506v1) |&#10;| Machine Learning Optimization of non&#45;Kasha Behavior and of Transient&#10; &#160;Dynamics in Model Retinal Isomerization | Davinder Singh, Chern Chuang, Paul Brumer | &#160;&#160;Designing a model of retinal isomerization in Rhodopsin, the first step in&#10;vision, that accounts for both experimental transient and stationary state&#10;observables is challenging. Here, multi&#45;objective Bayesian optimization is&#10;employed to refine the parameters of a minimal two&#45;state&#45;two&#45;mode (TM) model&#10;describing the photoisomerization of retinal in Rhodopsin. With an appropriate&#10;selection of objectives, the optimized retinal model predicts excitation&#10;wavelength&#45;dependent fluorescence spectra that closely align with&#10;experimentally observed non&#45;Kasha behavior in the non&#45;equilibrium steady state.&#10;Further, adjustments to the potential energy surface within the TM model reduce&#10;the discrepancies across the time domain. Overall, agreement with experimental&#10;data is excellent.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10505v1) |&#10;| DILA: Dictionary Label Attention for Mechanistic Interpretability in&#10; &#160;High&#45;dimensional Multi&#45;label Medical Coding Prediction | John Wu, David Wu, Jimeng Sun | &#160;&#160;Predicting high&#45;dimensional or extreme multilabels, such as in medical&#10;coding, requires both accuracy and interpretability. Existing works often rely&#10;on local interpretability methods, failing to provide comprehensive&#10;explanations of the overall mechanism behind each label prediction within a&#10;multilabel set. We propose a mechanistic interpretability module called&#10;DIctionary Label Attention (method) that disentangles uninterpretable dense&#10;embeddings into a sparse embedding space, where each nonzero element (a&#10;dictionary feature) represents a globally learned medical concept. Through&#10;human evaluations, we show that our sparse embeddings are more human&#10;understandable than its dense counterparts by at least 50 percent. Our&#10;automated dictionary feature identification pipeline, leveraging large language&#10;models (LLMs), uncovers thousands of learned medical concepts by examining and&#10;summarizing the highest activating tokens for each dictionary feature. We&#10;represent the relationships between dictionary features and medical codes&#10;through a sparse interpretable matrix, enhancing the mechanistic and global&#10;understanding of the model&#39;s predictions while maintaining competitive&#10;performance and scalability without extensive human annotation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10504v1) |&#10;| Causal Language Modeling Can Elicit Search and Reasoning Capabilities on&#10; &#160;Logic Puzzles | Kulin Shah, Nishanth Dikkala, Xin Wang, Rina Panigrahy | &#160;&#160;Causal language modeling using the Transformer architecture has yielded&#10;remarkable capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) over the last few&#10;years. However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning&#10;capabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this&#10;work, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as&#10;solving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to&#10;search over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then&#10;apply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the&#10;application of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in&#10;a cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases,&#10;multiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We&#10;observe that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn&#10;to solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21%$ of the puzzles fully correctly)&#10;when trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that&#10;training Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and&#10;without such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis&#10;to Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves&#10;$92.04 %$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal&#10;representations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear&#10;probing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any&#10;given cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine&#10;implicit in the Transformer weights.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10502v1) |&#10;| Alignment with nonlinear velocity couplings: collision&#45;avoidance and&#10; &#160;micro&#45;to&#45;macro mean&#45;field limits | Young&#45;Pil Choi, Michał Fabisiak, Jan Peszek | &#160;&#160;We investigate the pressureless fractional Euler&#45;alignment system with&#10;nonlinear velocity couplings, referred to as the $p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system.&#10;This model features a nonlinear velocity alignment force, interpreted as a&#10;density&#45;weighted fractional $p$&#45;Laplacian when the singularity parameter&#10;$alpha$ exceeds the spatial dimension $d$. Our primary goal is to establish&#10;the existence of solutions for strongly singular interactions ($alpha ge d$)&#10;and compactly supported initial conditions. We construct solutions as&#10;mean&#45;field limits of empirical measures from a kinetic variant of the&#10;$p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system. Specifically, we show that a sequence of empirical&#10;measures converges to a finite Radon measure, whose local density and velocity&#10;satisfy the $p$&#45;Euler&#45;alignment system. Our results are the first to prove the&#10;existence of solutions to this system in multi&#45;dimensional settings without&#10;significant initial data restrictions, covering both nonlinear ($p&gt;2$) and&#10;linear ($p=2$) cases. Additionally, we establish global existence, uniqueness,&#10;and collision avoidance for the corresponding particle ODE system under&#10;non&#45;collisional initial conditions, extending previous results for $1 &#10;e p &#10;e&#10;alpha + 2$. This analysis supports our mean&#45;field limit argument and&#10;contributes to understanding alignment models with singular communication.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10501v1) |&#10;| Focus diverse phase retrieval test results on broadband continuous&#10; &#160;wavefront sensing in space telescope applications | Hyukmo Kang, Kyle Van Gorkom, Meghdoot Biswas, Daewook Kim, Ewan S. Douglas | &#160;&#160;Continuous wavefront sensing benefits space observatories in on&#45;orbit optical&#10;performance maintenance. To measure the phase of a wavefront, phase retrieval&#10;is an attractive technique as it uses multiple point spread function (PSF)&#10;images that are acquired by the telescope itself without extra metrology&#10;systems nor complicated calibration. The focus diverse phase retrieval utilizes&#10;PSFs from predetermined defocused positions to enhance the dynamic range of the&#10;algorithm. We describe an updated visible light active optics testbed with the&#10;addition of a linear motorized focus stage. The performance of the phase&#10;retrieval algorithm in broadband is tested under various cases. While broadband&#10;pass filters have advantages in higher signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratio (SNR), the&#10;performance of phase retrieval can be restricted due to blurred image caused by&#10;diffraction and increased computing cost. We used multiple bandpass filters (10&#10;nm, 88 nm, and 150 nm) and investigated effects of bandwidth on the accuracy&#10;and required image acquisition conditions such as SNR, reaching accuracies&#10;below 20 nm RMS wavefront error at the widest bandwidth. We also investigated&#10;the dynamic range of the phase retrieval algorithm depending on the bandwidth&#10;and required amount of defocus to expand dynamic range. Finally, we simulated&#10;the continuous wavefront sensing and correction loop with a range of&#10;statistically generated representative telescope disturbance time series to&#10;test for edge cases.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10500v1) |&#10;| The role of higher&#45;order terms in trapped&#45;ion quantum computing with&#10; &#160;magnetic gradient induced coupling | Sebastian Nagies, Kevin T. Geier, Javed Akram, Junichi Okamoto, Dimitris Badounas, Christof Wunderlich, Michael Johanning, Philipp Hauke | &#160;&#160;Trapped&#45;ion hardware based on the Magnetic Gradient Induced Coupling (MAGIC)&#10;scheme is emerging as a promising platform for quantum computing. Nevertheless,&#10;in this (as in any other) quantum&#45;computing platform, many technical questions&#10;still have to be resolved before large&#45;scale and error&#45;tolerant applications&#10;are possible. In this work, we present a thorough discussion of the&#10;contribution of higher&#45;order terms to the MAGIC setup, which can occur due to&#10;anharmonicities in the external potential of the ion crystal (e.g., through&#10;Coulomb repulsion) or through curvature of the applied magnetic field. These&#10;terms take the form of three&#45;spin couplings as well as diverse terms that&#10;couple spins to phonons. We find that most of these are negligible in realistic&#10;situations, with only two contributions that need careful attention. First,&#10;there are parasitic longitudinal fields whose strength increases with chain&#10;length, but which can easily be compensated by a microwave detuning. Second,&#10;anharmonicities of the Coulomb interaction can lead to well&#45;known two&#45;to&#45;one&#10;conversions of phonon excitations, which can be avoided if the phonons are&#10;ground&#45;state cooled. Our detailed analysis constitutes an important&#10;contribution on the way of making magnetic&#45;gradient trapped&#45;ion quantum&#10;technology fit for large&#45;scale applications, and it may inspire new ways to&#10;purposefully design interaction terms.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10498v1) |&#10;| MusicLIME: Explainable Multimodal Music Understanding | Theodoros Sotirou, Vassilis Lyberatos, Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Stamou | &#160;&#160;Multimodal models are critical for music understanding tasks, as they capture&#10;the complex interplay between audio and lyrics. However, as these models become&#10;more prevalent, the need for explainability grows&#45;understanding how these&#10;systems make decisions is vital for ensuring fairness, reducing bias, and&#10;fostering trust. In this paper, we introduce MusicLIME, a model&#45;agnostic&#10;feature importance explanation method designed for multimodal music models.&#10;Unlike traditional unimodal methods, which analyze each modality separately&#10;without considering the interaction between them, often leading to incomplete&#10;or misleading explanations, MusicLIME reveals how audio and lyrical features&#10;interact and contribute to predictions, providing a holistic view of the&#10;model&#39;s decision&#45;making. Additionally, we enhance local explanations by&#10;aggregating them into global explanations, giving users a broader perspective&#10;of model behavior. Through this work, we contribute to improving the&#10;interpretability of multimodal music models, empowering users to make informed&#10;choices, and fostering more equitable, fair, and transparent music&#10;understanding systems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10496v1) |&#10;| Incorporating Classifier&#45;Free Guidance in Diffusion Model&#45;Based&#10; &#160;Recommendation | Noah Buchanan, Susan Gauch, Quan Mai | &#160;&#160;This paper presents a diffusion&#45;based recommender system that incorporates&#10;classifier&#45;free guidance. Most current recommender systems provide&#10;recommendations using conventional methods such as collaborative or&#10;content&#45;based filtering. Diffusion is a new approach to generative AI that&#10;improves on previous generative AI approaches such as Variational Autoencoders&#10;(VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We incorporate diffusion in&#10;a recommender system that mirrors the sequence users take when browsing and&#10;rating items. Although a few current recommender systems incorporate diffusion,&#10;they do not incorporate classifier&#45;free guidance, a new innovation in diffusion&#10;models as a whole. In this paper, we present a diffusion recommender system&#10;that augments the underlying recommender system model for improved performance&#10;and also incorporates classifier&#45;free guidance. Our findings show improvements&#10;over state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art recommender systems for most metrics for several&#10;recommendation tasks on a variety of datasets. In particular, our approach&#10;demonstrates the potential to provide better recommendations when data is&#10;sparse.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10494v1) |&#10;| Renormalization of the Einstein&#45;Cartan Theory in First&#45;Order Form | F. T. Brandt, J. Frenkel, S. Martins&#45;Filho, D. G. C. McKeon | &#160;&#160;We examine the Einstein&#45;Cartan (EC) theory in first&#45;order form, which has a&#10;diffeomorphism as well as a local Lorentz invariance. We study the&#10;renormalizability of this theory in the framework of the Batalin&#45;Vilkovisky&#10;formalism, which allows for a gauge invariant renormalization. Using the&#10;background field method, we discuss the gauge invariance of the background&#10;effective action and analyze the Ward identities which reflect the symmetries&#10;of the EC theory. As an application, we compute, in a general background gauge,&#10;the self&#45;energy of the tetrad field at one&#45;loop order.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10493v1) |&#10;| What we can learn from the angular differential rates (only) in&#10; &#160;semileptonic $B to D^* ell ν_ell$ decays | G. Martinelli, S. Simula, L. Vittorio | &#160;&#160;We present a new, simple approach to the study of semileptonic $B to D^*&#10;ell &#10;u_ell$ decays based on the angular distributions of the final state&#10;particles only. Our approach is model independent and never requires the&#10;knowledge of $vert V_{cb}vert$. By studying such distributions in the case of&#10;light leptons, a comparison between results from different data sets from the&#10;Belle and BelleII Collaborations and between data and Standard Model&#10;calculations is also given for several interesting quantities. A good&#10;consistency is observed between some of the experimental results and the&#10;theoretical predictions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10492v1) |&#10;| Code Vulnerability Detection: A Comparative Analysis of Emerging Large&#10; &#160;Language Models | Shaznin Sultana, Sadia Afreen, Nasir U. Eisty | &#160;&#160;The growing trend of vulnerability issues in software development as a result&#10;of a large dependence on open&#45;source projects has received considerable&#10;attention recently. This paper investigates the effectiveness of Large Language&#10;Models (LLMs) in identifying vulnerabilities within codebases, with a focus on&#10;the latest advancements in LLM technology. Through a comparative analysis, we&#10;assess the performance of emerging LLMs, specifically Llama, CodeLlama, Gemma,&#10;and CodeGemma, alongside established state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art models such as BERT,&#10;RoBERTa, and GPT&#45;3. Our study aims to shed light on the capabilities of LLMs in&#10;vulnerability detection, contributing to the enhancement of software security&#10;practices across diverse open&#45;source repositories. We observe that CodeGemma&#10;achieves the highest F1&#45;score of 58 and a Recall of 87, amongst the recent&#10;additions of large language models to detect software security vulnerabilities.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10490v1) |&#10;| Flash STU: Fast Spectral Transform Units | Y.

Our paper aims to investigate if VLMs&#10;pre&#45;trained on web&#45;scale data learn to encode object states, which can be&#10;extracted with zero&#45;shot text prompts. We curate an object state recognition&#10;dataset ChangeIt&#45;Frames, and evaluate nine open&#45;source VLMs, including models&#10;trained with contrastive and generative objectives. We observe that while these&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art vision&#45;language models can reliably perform object&#10;recognition, they consistently fail to accurately distinguish the objects&#39;&#10;physical states. Through extensive experiments, we identify three areas for&#10;improvements for VLMs to better encode object states, namely the quality of&#10;object localization, the architecture to bind concepts to objects, and the&#10;objective to learn discriminative visual and language encoders on object&#10;states.

Ruan, Michael Eracleous, Daryl Haggard, Jessie C. Runnoe | &#160;&#160;The physical processes that produce X&#45;ray Quasi&#45;Periodic Eruptions (QPEs)&#10;recently discovered from the nuclei of several low&#45;redshift galaxies are&#10;mysterious. Several pieces of observational evidence strongly suggest a link&#10;between QPEs and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE). Previous studies also reveal&#10;that the morphologies of TDE host galaxies are highly concentrated, with high&#10;Sersic indicies, bulge&#45;to&#45;total light (B/T) ratios, and stellar surface mass&#10;densities relative to the broader galaxy population. We use these distinctive&#10;properties to test the link between QPEs and TDEs, by comparing these&#10;parameters of QPE host galaxies to TDE host galaxies. We employ archival Legacy&#10;Survey images of a sample of 9 QPE host galaxies and a sample of 13 TDE host&#10;galaxies, and model their surface brightness profiles. We show that QPE host&#10;galaxies have high Sersic indices of ~3, high B/T ratios of ~0.5, and high&#10;surface mass densities of ~10^10 Msun kpc^&#45;2. These properties are similar to&#10;TDE host galaxies, but are in strong contrast to a mass&#45; and redshift&#45;matched&#10;control sample of galaxies. We also find tentative evidence that the central&#10;black holes in both QPE and TDE host galaxies are undermassive relative to&#10;their stellar mass. The morphological similarities between QPE and TDE host&#10;galaxies at the population level add to the mounting evidence of a physical&#10;link between these phenomena, and favor QPE models that also invoke TDEs.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10486v1) |&#10;| Tuning the Rate of Tightly Packed Systems To Produce Planet Occurrence&#10; &#160;Trends with Galactic Height | Sarah Ballard | &#160;&#160;The formation of planetary systems has historically been considered in&#10;isolation, decoupled from processes on galactic scales. Recent findings&#10;employing data from ESA&#39;s Gaia mission challenge this narrative, identifying&#10;trends in planet occurrence with galactic kinematics and stellar age. The&#10;findings indicate changes in planet occurrence over and above the predicted&#10;changes from metallicity variation within the Milky Way, so that changes to&#10;stellar metallicity alone (long understood to be deterministic in planet&#10;outcomes) cannot explain the trends entirely. The scope of potential factors&#10;influencing planet formation has grown progressively wider, with accompanying&#10;theoretical support for galactic&#45;scale influences upon planet formation. In&#10;this manuscript, we investigate specifically how changes to the rate of Systems&#10;of Tightly&#45;packed Inner Planets (STIPs) could manifest as a trend in planet&#10;occurrence with galactic height. We focus our study upon M dwarf planetary&#10;systems for two reasons: first, they host STIPs at high rates, and secondly,&#10;their longevity makes them useful probes for kinematic trends over Gyr. We&#10;consider two models for a varying STIP rate: one in which STIP likelihood is&#10;determined by stellar age alone, irrespective of galactic time, and another in&#10;which the STIP likelihood suddenly increased in recent galactic history. Both&#10;models, which impose a higher STIP likelihood among younger stars, produce a&#10;negative gradient in planet occurrence with increasing height from the galactic&#10;midplane. We find that a step function model in which STIP likelihood increased&#10;by a factor of several ~a few Gyr ago resembles an observed trend among FGK&#10;dwarfs. We consider plausible physical mechanisms that could mimic the&#10;hypothesized model, given known links between STIP occurrence and other stellar&#10;and planetary properties.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10485v1) |&#10;| XLM for Autonomous Driving Systems: A Comprehensive Review | Sonda Fourati, Wael Jaafar, Noura Baccar, Safwan Alfattani | &#160;&#160;Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable proficiency in various&#10;information&#45;processing tasks. These tasks span from extracting data and&#10;summarizing literature to generating content, predictive modeling,&#10;decision&#45;making, and system controls. Moreover, Vision Large Models (VLMs) and&#10;Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which represent the next generation of language&#10;models, a.k.a., XLMs, can combine and integrate many data modalities with the&#10;strength of language understanding, thus advancing several information&#45;based&#10;systems, such as Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). Indeed, by combining&#10;language communication with multimodal sensory inputs, e.g., panoramic images&#10;and LiDAR or radar data, accurate driving actions can be taken. In this&#10;context, we provide in this survey paper a comprehensive overview of the&#10;potential of XLMs towards achieving autonomous driving. Specifically, we review&#10;the relevant literature on ADS and XLMs, including their architectures, tools,&#10;and frameworks. Then, we detail the proposed approaches to deploy XLMs for&#10;autonomous driving solutions.

Fay, Nicolas Ferré, Miquel Huix&#45;Rotllant | &#160;&#160;Electronic polarization and dispersion are decisive actors in determining&#10;interaction energies between molecules. These interactions have a particularly&#10;profound effect on excitation energies of molecules in complex environments,&#10;especially when the excitation involves a significant degree of charge&#10;reorganisation. The direct reaction field (DRF) approach, which has seen a&#10;recent revival of interest, provides a powerful framework for describing these&#10;interactions in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models of&#10;systems, where a small subsystem of interest is described using quantum&#10;chemical methods and the remainder is treated with a simple MM force field. In&#10;this paper we show how the DRF approach can be combined with the electrostatic&#10;potential fitted (ESPF) multipole operator description of the QM region charge&#10;density, which reduces the scaling $mathcal{O}(N_mathrm{MM}^3)$ of the method&#10;with MM system to $mathcal{O}(N_mathrm{MM}^2)$. We also show how the DRF&#10;approach can be combined with fluctuating charge descriptions of the&#10;polarizable environment, as well as previously used atom&#45;centred&#10;dipole&#45;polarizability based models. We further show that the ESPF&#45;DRF method&#10;provides an accurate description of molecular interactions in both ground and&#10;excited electronic states of the QM system and apply it to predict the gas to&#10;aqueous solution solvatochromic shifts in the UV/visible absorption spectrum of&#10;acrolein.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10483v1) |&#10;| Schrodinger&#39;s Memory: Large Language Models | Wei Wang, Qing Li | &#160;&#160;Memory is the foundation of LLMs&#39; functionality, yet past research has lacked&#10;an in&#45;depth exploration of their memory capabilities and underlying theory.

These assumptions limit their use&#10;when acquisition conditions, such as the subject&#39;s distance from the camera or&#10;the camera&#39;s characteristics, are different than expected, as typically happens&#10;in video surveillance. Additionally, 3DFR algorithms follow various strategies&#10;to address the reconstruction of a 3D shape from 2D data, such as statistical&#10;model fitting, photometric stereo, or deep learning. In the present study, we&#10;explore the application of three 3DFR algorithms representative of the SOTA,&#10;employing each one as the template set generator for a face verification&#10;system. The scores provided by each system are combined by score&#45;level fusion.&#10;We show that the complementarity induced by different 3DFR algorithms improves&#10;performance when tests are conducted at never&#45;seen&#45;before distances from the&#10;camera and camera characteristics (cross&#45;distance and cross&#45;camera settings),&#10;thus encouraging further investigations on multiple 3DFR&#45;based approaches.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10481v1) |&#10;| Addressing misspecification in contextual optimization | Omar Bennouna, Jiawei Zhang, Saurabh Amin, Asuman Ozdaglar | &#160;&#160;We study a linear contextual optimization problem where a decision maker has&#10;access to historical data and contextual features to learn a cost prediction&#10;model aimed at minimizing decision error. We adopt the predict&#45;then&#45;optimize&#10;framework for this analysis. Given that perfect model alignment with reality is&#10;often unrealistic in practice, we focus on scenarios where the chosen&#10;hypothesis set is misspecified. In this context, it remains unclear whether&#10;current contextual optimization approaches can effectively address such model&#10;misspecification. In this paper, we present a novel integrated learning and&#10;optimization approach designed to tackle model misspecification in contextual&#10;optimization. This approach offers theoretical generalizability, tractability,&#10;and optimality guarantees, along with strong practical performance. Our method&#10;involves minimizing a tractable surrogate loss that aligns with the performance&#10;value from cost vector predictions, regardless of whether the model&#10;misspecified or not, and can be optimized in reasonable time. To our knowledge,&#10;no previous work has provided an approach with such guarantees in the context&#10;of model misspecification.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10479v1) |&#10;| Local SGD for Near&#45;Quadratic Problems: Improving Convergence under&#10; &#160;Unconstrained Noise Conditions | Andrey Sadchikov, Savelii Chezhegov, Aleksandr Beznosikov, Alexander Gasnikov | &#160;&#160;Distributed optimization plays an important role in modern large&#45;scale&#10;machine learning and data processing systems by optimizing the utilization of&#10;computational resources. One of the classical and popular approaches is Local&#10;Stochastic Gradient Descent (Local SGD), characterized by multiple local&#10;updates before averaging, which is particularly useful in distributed&#10;environments to reduce communication bottlenecks and improve scalability. A&#10;typical feature of this method is the dependence on the frequency of&#10;communications. But in the case of a quadratic target function with homogeneous&#10;data distribution over all devices, the influence of frequency of&#10;communications vanishes. As a natural consequence, subsequent studies include&#10;the assumption of a Lipschitz Hessian, as this indicates the similarity of the&#10;optimized function to a quadratic one to some extent. However, in order to&#10;extend the completeness of the Local SGD theory and unlock its potential, in&#10;this paper we abandon the Lipschitz Hessian assumption by introducing a new&#10;concept of $textit{approximate quadraticity}$. This assumption gives a new&#10;perspective on problems that have near quadratic properties. In addition,&#10;existing theoretical analyses of Local SGD often assume bounded variance. We,&#10;in turn, consider the unbounded noise condition, which allows us to broaden the&#10;class of studied problems.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10478v1) |&#10;| SimInversion: A Simple Framework for Inversion&#45;Based Text&#45;to&#45;Image&#10; &#160;Editing | Qi Qian, Haiyang Xu, Ming Yan, Juhua Hu | &#160;&#160;Diffusion models demonstrate impressive image generation performance with&#10;text guidance. Inspired by the learning process of diffusion, existing images&#10;can be edited according to text by DDIM inversion. However, the vanilla DDIM&#10;inversion is not optimized for classifier&#45;free guidance and the accumulated&#10;error will result in the undesired performance. While many algorithms are&#10;developed to improve the framework of DDIM inversion for editing, in this work,&#10;we investigate the approximation error in DDIM inversion and propose to&#10;disentangle the guidance scale for the source and target branches to reduce the&#10;error while keeping the original framework. Moreover, a better guidance scale&#10;(i.e., 0.5) than default settings can be derived theoretically. Experiments on&#10;PIE&#45;Bench show that our proposal can improve the performance of DDIM inversion&#10;dramatically without sacrificing efficiency.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10476v1) |&#10;| Leadership and Engagement Dynamics in Legislative Twitter Networks:&#10; &#160;Statistical Analysis and Modeling | Carolina Luque, Juan Sosa | &#160;&#160;In this manuscript, we analyze the interaction network on Twitter among&#10;members of the 117th U.S. Congress to assess the visibility of political&#10;leaders and explore how systemic properties and node attributes influence the&#10;formation of legislative connections. We employ descriptive social network&#10;statistical methods, the exponential random graph model (ERGM), and the&#10;stochastic block model (SBM) to evaluate the relative impact of network&#10;systemic properties, as well as institutional and personal traits, on the&#10;generation of online relationships among legislators. Our findings reveal that&#10;legislative networks on social media platforms like Twitter tend to reinforce&#10;the leadership of dominant political actors rather than diminishing their&#10;influence. However, we identify that these leadership roles can manifest in&#10;various forms.

However, previous works either rely on contrastive learning that&#10;suffers false negative problems or are based on reconstruction that learns too&#10;much unessential low&#45;level clues, leading to limited representations for&#10;downstream tasks. Recently, great advances have been made in generative&#10;learning, which is naturally a challenging yet meaningful pretext task to model&#10;the general underlying data distributions. However, the representation learning&#10;capacity of generative models is under&#45;explored, especially for the skeletons&#10;with spacial sparsity and temporal redundancy. To this end, we propose Masked&#10;Conditional Diffusion (MacDiff) as a unified framework for human skeleton&#10;modeling. For the first time, we leverage diffusion models as effective&#10;skeleton representation learners. Specifically, we train a diffusion decoder&#10;conditioned on the representations extracted by a semantic encoder. Random&#10;masking is applied to encoder inputs to introduce a information bottleneck and&#10;remove redundancy of skeletons. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that&#10;our generative objective involves the contrastive learning objective which&#10;aligns the masked and noisy views. Meanwhile, it also enforces the&#10;representation to complement for the noisy view, leading to better&#10;generalization performance. MacDiff achieves state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art performance on&#10;representation learning benchmarks while maintaining the competence for&#10;generative tasks. Moreover, we leverage the diffusion model for data&#10;augmentation, significantly enhancing the fine&#45;tuning performance in scenarios&#10;with scarce labeled data.

Hassan | &#160;&#160;The proliferation of open Pre&#45;trained Language Models (PTLMs) on model&#10;registry platforms like Hugging Face (HF) presents both opportunities and&#10;challenges for companies building products around them. Similar to traditional&#10;software dependencies, PTLMs continue to evolve after a release. However, the&#10;current state of release practices of PTLMs on model registry platforms are&#10;plagued by a variety of inconsistencies, such as ambiguous naming conventions&#10;and inaccessible model training documentation. Given the knowledge gap on&#10;current PTLM release practices, our empirical study uses a mixed&#45;methods&#10;approach to analyze the releases of 52,227 PTLMs on the most well&#45;known model&#10;registry, HF. Our results reveal 148 different naming practices for PTLM&#10;releases, with 40.87% of changes to model weight files not represented in the&#10;adopted name&#45;based versioning practice or their documentation. In addition, we&#10;identified that the 52,227 PTLMs are derived from only 299 different base&#10;models (the modified original models used to create 52,227 PTLMs), with&#10;Fine&#45;tuning and Quantization being the most prevalent modification methods&#10;applied to these base models. Significant gaps in release transparency, in&#10;terms of training dataset specifications and model card availability, still&#10;exist, highlighting the need for standardized documentation. While we&#10;identified a model naming practice explicitly differentiating between major and&#10;minor PTLM releases, we did not find any significant difference in the types of&#10;changes that went into either type of releases, suggesting that major/minor&#10;version numbers for PTLMs often are chosen arbitrarily. Our findings provide&#10;valuable insights to improve PTLM release practices, nudging the field towards&#10;more formal semantic versioning practices.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10472v1) |&#10;| Real&#45;Time Whole&#45;Body Control of Legged Robots with Model&#45;Predictive Path&#10; &#160;Integral Control | Juan Alvarez&#45;Padilla, John Z. Zhang, Sofia Kwok, John M. Dolan, Zachary Manchester | &#160;&#160;This paper presents a system for enabling real&#45;time synthesis of whole&#45;body&#10;locomotion and manipulation policies for real&#45;world legged robots. Motivated by&#10;recent advancements in robot simulation, we leverage the efficient&#10;parallelization capabilities of the MuJoCo simulator to achieve fast sampling&#10;over the robot state and action trajectories. Our results show surprisingly&#10;effective real&#45;world locomotion and manipulation capabilities with a very&#10;simple control strategy. We demonstrate our approach on several hardware and&#10;simulation experiments: robust locomotion over flat and uneven terrains,&#10;climbing over a box whose height is comparable to the robot, and pushing a box&#10;to a goal position. To our knowledge, this is the first successful deployment&#10;of whole&#45;body sampling&#45;based MPC on real&#45;world legged robot hardware.&#10;Experiment videos and code can be found at: https://whole&#45;body&#45;mppi.github.io/&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10469v1) |&#10;| Assortativity in sympatric speciation and species classification | Joao U. F. Lizarraga, Flavia M. D. Marquitti, Marcus A. M. de Aguiar | &#160;&#160;We investigate the role of assortative mating in speciation using the&#10;sympatric model of Derrida and Higgs. The model explores the idea that genetic&#10;differences create incompatibilities between individuals, preventing mating if&#10;the number of such differences is too large. Speciation, however, only happens&#10;in this mating system if the number of genes is large. Here we show that&#10;speciation with small genome sizes can occur if assortative mating is&#10;introduced. In our model individuals are represented by three chromosomes: one&#10;responsible for reproductive compatibility, one for coding the trait on which&#10;assortativity will operate, and a neutral chromosome. Reproduction is possible&#10;if individuals are genetically similar with respect to the first chromosome,&#10;but among these compatible mating partners, the one with the most similar trait&#10;coded by the second chromosome is selected. We show that this type of&#10;assortativity facilitates speciation, which can happen with a small number of&#10;genes in the first chromosome. Species, classified according to reproductive&#10;isolation, dictated by the first chromosome, can display different traits&#10;values, as measured by the second and the third chromosomes. Therefore, species&#10;can also be identified based on similarity of the neutral trait, which works as&#10;a proxy for reproductive isolation.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10466v1) |&#10;| A stabilized total pressure&#45;formulation of the Biot&#39;s poroelasticity&#10; &#160;equations in frequency domain: numerical analysis and applications | Cristian Cárcamo, Alfonso Caiazzo, Felipe Galarce, Joaquín Mura | &#160;&#160;This work focuses on the numerical solution of the dynamics of a poroelastic&#10;material in the frequency domain. We provide a detailed stability analysis&#10;based on the application of the Fredholm alternative in the continuous case,&#10;considering a total pressure formulation of the Biot&#39;s equations. In the&#10;discrete setting, we propose a stabilized equal order finite element method&#10;complemented by an additional pressure stabilization to enhance the robustness&#10;of the numerical scheme with respect to the fluid permeability. Utilizing the&#10;Fredholm alternative, we extend the well&#45;posedness results to the discrete&#10;setting, obtaining theoretical optimal convergence for the case of linear&#10;finite elements. We present different numerical experiments to validate the&#10;proposed method. First, we consider model problems with known analytic&#10;solutions in two and three dimensions. As next, we show that the method is&#10;robust for a wide range of permeabilities, including the case of discontinuous&#10;coefficients. Lastly, we show the application for the simulation of brain&#10;elastography on a realistic brain geometry obtained from medical imaging.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10465v1) |&#10;| New Direct Sum Tests | Alek Westover, Edward Yu, Kai Zheng | &#160;&#160;A function $f:[n]^{d} to mathbb{F}_2$ is a defn{direct sum} if there are&#10;functions $L_i:[n]to mathbb{F}_2$ such that ${f(x) = sum_{i}L_i(x_i)}$. In&#10;this work we give multiple results related to the property testing of direct&#10;sums.&#10; &#160;Our first result concerns a test proposed by Dinur and Golubev in 2019. We&#10;call their test the Diamond test and show that it is indeed a direct sum&#10;tester. More specifically, we show that if a function $f$ is $epsilon$&#45;far&#10;from being a direct sum function, then the Diamond test rejects $f$ with&#10;probability at least $Omega_{n,epsilon}(1)$. Even in the case of $n = 2$, the&#10;Diamond test is, to the best of our knowledge, novel and yields a new tester&#10;for the classic property of affinity.&#10; &#160;Apart from the Diamond test, we also analyze a broad family of direct sum&#10;tests, which at a high level, run an arbitrary affinity test on the restriction&#10;of $f$ to a random hypercube inside of $[n]^d$. This family of tests includes&#10;the direct sum test analyzed in cite{di19}, but does not include the Diamond&#10;test. As an application of our result, we obtain a direct sum test which works&#10;in the online adversary model of cite{KRV}.&#10; &#160;Finally, we also discuss a Fourier analytic interpretation of the diamond&#10;tester in the $n=2$ case, as well as prove local correction results for direct&#10;sum as conjectured by Dinur and Golubev.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10464v1) |&#10;| Kolmogorov&#45;Arnold Networks in Low&#45;Data Regimes: A Comparative Study with&#10; &#160;Multilayer Perceptrons | Farhad Pourkamali&#45;Anaraki | &#160;&#160;Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) have long been a cornerstone in deep learning,&#10;known for their capacity to model complex relationships. Recently,&#10;Kolmogorov&#45;Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a compelling alternative,&#10;utilizing highly flexible learnable activation functions directly on network&#10;edges, a departure from the neuron&#45;centric approach of MLPs. However, KANs&#10;significantly increase the number of learnable parameters, raising concerns&#10;about their effectiveness in data&#45;scarce environments. This paper presents a&#10;comprehensive comparative study of MLPs and KANs from both algorithmic and&#10;experimental perspectives, with a focus on low&#45;data regimes. We introduce an&#10;effective technique for designing MLPs with unique, parameterized activation&#10;functions for each neuron, enabling a more balanced comparison with KANs. Using&#10;empirical evaluations on simulated data and two real&#45;world data sets from&#10;medicine and engineering, we explore the trade&#45;offs between model complexity&#10;and accuracy, with particular attention to the role of network depth. Our&#10;findings show that MLPs with individualized activation functions achieve&#10;significantly higher predictive accuracy with only a modest increase in&#10;parameters, especially when the sample size is limited to around one hundred.&#10;For example, in a three&#45;class classification problem within additive&#10;manufacturing, MLPs achieve a median accuracy of 0.91, significantly&#10;outperforming KANs, which only reach a median accuracy of 0.53 with default&#10;hyperparameters. These results offer valuable insights into the impact of&#10;activation function selection in neural networks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10463v1) |&#10;| Effects of synapse location, delay and background stochastic activity on&#10; &#160;synchronising hippocampal CA1 neurons | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore | &#160;&#160;We study the synchronisation of neurons in a realistic model under the&#10;Hodgkin&#45;Huxley dynamics. To focus on the role of the different locations of the&#10;excitatory synapses, we use two identical neurons where the set of input&#10;signals is grouped at two different distances from the soma. The system is&#10;intended to represent a CA1 hippocampal neuron in which the synapses arriving&#10;from the CA3 neurons of the trisynaptic pathway appear to be localised in the&#10;apical dendritic region and are, in principle, either proximal or distal to the&#10;soma. Synchronisation is studied using a specifically defined spiking&#10;correlation function as a function of various parameters such as the distance&#10;from the soma of one of the synaptic groups, the inhibition weight and the&#10;associated activation delay. We found that the neurons&#39; spiking activity&#10;depends nonmonotonically on the relative dendritic location of the synapses and&#10;their inhibitory weight, whereas the synchronisation measure always decreases&#10;with inhibition, and strongly depends on its activation time delay. The&#10;background activity on the somas results essentially independent on the&#10;fluctuation intensity and strongly support the importance of the balance&#10;between inhibition and excitation for neuronal synchronization.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10460v1) |&#10;| Efficiently Crowdsourcing Visual Importance with Punch&#45;Hole Annotation | Minsuk Chang, Soohyun Lee, Aeri Cho, Hyeon Jeon, Seokhyeon Park, Cindy Xiong Bearfield, Jinwook Seo | &#160;&#160;We introduce a novel crowdsourcing method for identifying important areas in&#10;graphical images through punch&#45;hole labeling. Traditional methods, such as gaze&#10;trackers and mouse&#45;based annotations, which generate continuous data, can be&#10;impractical in crowdsourcing scenarios. They require many participants, and the&#10;outcome data can be noisy. In contrast, our method first segments the graphical&#10;image with a grid and drops a portion of the patches (punch holes). Then, we&#10;iteratively ask the labeler to validate each annotation with holes, narrowing&#10;down the annotation only having the most important area. This approach aims to&#10;reduce annotation noise in crowdsourcing by standardizing the annotations while&#10;enhancing labeling efficiency and reliability. Preliminary findings from&#10;fundamental charts demonstrate that punch&#45;hole labeling can effectively&#10;pinpoint critical regions. This also highlights its potential for broader&#10;application in visualization research, particularly in studying large&#45;scale&#10;users&#39; graphical perception. Our future work aims to enhance the algorithm to&#10;achieve faster labeling speed and prove its utility through large&#45;scale&#10;experiments.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10459v1) |&#10;| Full distribution of local observables in an exactly solvable current&#10; &#160;carrying steady states of a driven XXZ chain | Sandipan Manna, G J Sreejith | &#160;&#160;Current carrying steady states of interacting spins chains exhibit rich&#10;structures generated through an interplay of current induced correlations and&#10;energetic constraints from the Hamiltonian. The XXZ spin chain when coupled to&#10;maximally polarizing Lindblad terms admits an exact solution in a matrix&#10;product state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations&#10;and distributions of simple local spin observables in the non equilibrium&#10;steady state (NESS). We present exact expressions for spin correlators, entropy&#10;per site, cumulant generating functions for distributions of local observables&#10;in the XX limit (Ising anisotropy $Delta=0$). Further, we use the exact MPS&#10;solution in systems with $Delta&gt;0$, to numerically exactly calculate the&#10;entropy, correlations, as well as distributions of spin observables in blocks&#10;as large as $nsim 200$ sites allowing an estimation of the rate functions. The&#10;$z$ magnetization distribution is consistant with short range spin correlations&#10;in the $z$ direction while the $x$&#45;magnetization shows a double peak structure&#10;at larger $Delta$ suggesting short range ferromagnetic ordering. We find that&#10;the distribution of $z$&#45;magnetization sharpens for parameters where the current&#10;is maximized.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10458v1) |&#10;| Mean Residual Life Ageing Intensity Function | Ashutosh Singh, Ishapathik Das, Asok Kumar Nanda, Sumen Sen | &#160;&#160;The ageing intensity function is a powerful analytical tool that provides&#10;valuable insights into the ageing process across diverse domains such as&#10;reliability engineering, actuarial science, and healthcare. Its applications&#10;continue to expand as researchers delve deeper into understanding the complex&#10;dynamics of ageing and its implications for society. One common approach to&#10;defining the ageing intensity function is through the hazard rate or failure&#10;rate function, extensively explored in scholarly literature. Equally&#10;significant to the hazard rate function is the mean residual life function,&#10;which plays a crucial role in analyzing the ageing patterns exhibited by units&#10;or components. This article introduces the mean residual life ageing intensity&#10;(MRLAI) function to delve into component ageing behaviours across various&#10;distributions. Additionally, we scrutinize the closure properties of the MRLAI&#10;function across different reliability operations. Furthermore, a new order&#10;termed the mean residual life ageing intensity order is defined to analyze the&#10;ageing behaviour of a system, and the closure property of this order under&#10;various reliability operations is discussed.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10456v1) |&#10;| Quantile Fourier regressions for decision making under uncertainty | Arash Khojaste, Geoffrey Pritchard, Golbon Zakeri | &#160;&#160;Weconsider Markov decision processes arising from a Markov model of an&#10;underlying natural phenomenon. Such phenomena are usually periodic (e.g.&#10;annual) in time, and so the Markov processes modelling them must be&#10;time&#45;inhomogeneous, with cyclostationary rather than stationary behaviour. We&#10;describe a technique for constructing such processes that allows for periodic&#10;variations both in the values taken by the process and in the serial dependence&#10;structure. We include two illustrative numerical examples: a hydropower&#10;scheduling problem and a model of offshore wind power integration.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10455v1) |&#10;| The Debiased Near&#45;Earth Object Population from ATLAS Telescopes | Rogerio Deienno, Larry Denneau, David Nesvorný, David Vokrouhlický, William F. Bottke, Robert Jedicke, Shantanu Naidu, Steven R. Chesley, Davide Farnocchia, Paul W. Chodas | &#160;&#160;This work is dedicated to debias the Near&#45;Earth Objects (NEO) population&#10;based on observations from the Asteroid Terrestrial&#45;impact Last Alert System&#10;(ATLAS) telescopes. We have applied similar methods used to develop the&#10;recently released NEO model generator (NEOMOD), once debiasing the NEO&#10;population using data from Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) G96 telescope. ATLAS is&#10;composed of four different telescopes. We first analyzed observational data&#10;from each of all four telescopes separately and later combined them. Our&#10;results highlight main differences between CSS and ATLAS, e.g., sky coverage&#10;and survey power at debiasing the NEO population. ATLAS has a much larger sky&#10;coverage than CSS, allowing it to find bright NEOs that would be constantly&#10;&quot;hiding&quot; from CSS. Consequently, ATLAS is more powerful than CSS at debiasing&#10;the NEO population for H $&#10;esssim$ 19. With its intrinsically greater&#10;sensitivity and emphasis on observing near opposition, CSS excels in the&#10;debiasing of smaller objects. ATLAS, as an all sky survey designed to find&#10;imminent hazardous objects, necessarily spends a significant fraction of time&#10;looking at places on the sky where objects do not appear, reducing its power&#10;for debiasing the population of small objects. We estimate a NEO population&#10;completeness of $approx$ 88%$^{+3%}_{&#45;2%}$ for H $&lt;$ 17.75 and $approx$&#10;36%$^{+1%}_{&#45;1%}$ for H $&lt;$ 22.25. Those numbers are similar to previous&#10;estimates (within error bars for H $&lt;$ 17.75) from CSS, yet, around 3% and 8%&#10;smaller at their face values, respectively. We also confirm previous finding&#10;that the $&#10;u_6$ secular resonance is the main source of small and faint NEOs&#10;at H = 28, whereas the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter dominates for&#10;larger and brighter NEOs at H = 15.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10453v1) |&#10;| Signed Graph Autoencoder for Explainable and Polarization&#45;Aware Network&#10; &#160;Embeddings | Nikolaos Nakis, Chrysoula Kosma, Giannis Nikolentzos, Michalis Chatzianastasis, Iakovos Evdaimon, Michalis Vazirgiannis | &#160;&#160;Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant&#10;attention in recent years for their ability to extract informative latent&#10;representations, characterizing the structure of complex topologies, such as&#10;graphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited&#10;focus on developing and evaluating explainable neural&#45;based graph generative&#10;models specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we&#10;propose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE&#10;extracts node&#45;level representations that express node memberships over distinct&#10;extreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is&#10;achieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its&#10;polarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for&#10;analyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with&#10;relational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation&#10;demonstrates the SGAAEs&#39; capability to successfully infer node memberships over&#10;the different underlying latent structures while extracting competing&#10;communities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the&#10;network. Additionally, we introduce the 2&#45;level network polarization problem&#10;and show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model&#10;achieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across&#10;four real&#45;world datasets, outperforming several baseline models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10452v1) |&#10;| Why you should also use OLS estimation of tail exponents | Thiago Trafane Oliveira Santos, Daniel Oliveira Cajueiro | &#160;&#160;Even though practitioners often estimate Pareto exponents running OLS&#10;rank&#45;size regressions, the usual recommendation is to use the Hill MLE with a&#10;small&#45;sample correction instead, due to its unbiasedness and efficiency. In&#10;this paper, we advocate that you should also apply OLS in empirical&#10;applications. On the one hand, we demonstrate that, with a small&#45;sample&#10;correction, the OLS estimator is also unbiased. On the other hand, we show that&#10;the MLE assigns significantly greater weight to smaller observations. This&#10;suggests that the OLS estimator may outperform the MLE in cases where the&#10;distribution is (i) strictly Pareto but only in the upper tail or (ii)&#10;regularly varying rather than strictly Pareto. We substantiate our theoretical&#10;findings with Monte Carlo simulations and real&#45;world applications,&#10;demonstrating the practical relevance of the OLS method in estimating tail&#10;exponents.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10448v1) |&#10;| Hydrodynamic hovering of swimming bacteria above surfaces | Pyae Hein Htet, Debasish Das, Eric Lauga | &#160;&#160;Flagellated bacteria are hydrodynamically attracted to rigid walls, yet past&#10;work shows a &#39;hovering&#39; state where they swim stably at a finite height above&#10;surfaces. We use numerics and theory to reveal the physical origin of hovering.&#10;Simulations first show that hovering requires an elongated cell body and&#10;results from a tilt away from the wall. Theoretical models then identify two&#10;essential asymmetries: the response of width&#45;asymmetric cells to active flows&#10;created by length&#45;asymmetric cells. A minimal model reconciles near and&#10;far&#45;field hydrodynamics, capturing all key features of hovering.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10447v1) |&#10;| KoroT&#45;3E: A Personalized Musical Mnemonics Tool for Enhancing Memory&#10; &#160;Retention of Complex Computer Science Concepts | Xiangzhe Yuan, Jiajun Wang, Siying Hu, Andrew Cheung, Zhicong Lu | &#160;&#160;As the demand for computer science (CS) skills grows, mastering foundational&#10;concepts is crucial yet challenging for novice learners. To address this&#10;challenge, we present KoroT&#45;3E, an AI&#45;based system that creates personalized&#10;musical mnemonics to enhance both memory retention and understanding of&#10;concepts in CS. KoroT&#45;3E enables users to transform complex concepts into&#10;memorable lyrics and compose melodies that suit their musical preferences. We&#10;conducted semi&#45;structured interviews (n=12) to investigate why novice learners&#10;find it challenging to memorize and understand CS concepts. The findings,&#10;combined with constructivist learning theory, established our initial design,&#10;which was then refined following consultations with CS education experts. An&#10;empirical experiment(n=36) showed that those using KoroT&#45;3E (n=18)&#10;significantly outperformed the control group (n=18), with improved memory&#10;efficiency, increased motivation, and a positive learning experience.

It is&#10;a challenging problem due to the intricate characteristics of insects. In this&#10;paper, we present DeWi, novel learning assistance for insect pest&#10;classification. With a one&#45;stage and alternating training strategy, DeWi&#10;simultaneously improves several Convolutional Neural Networks in two&#10;perspectives: discrimination (by optimizing a triplet margin loss in a&#10;supervised training manner) and generalization (via data augmentation). From&#10;that, DeWi can learn discriminative and in&#45;depth features of insect pests&#10;(deep) yet still generalize well to a large number of insect categories (wide).&#10;Experimental results show that DeWi achieves the highest performances on two&#10;insect pest classification benchmarks (76.44% accuracy on the IP102 dataset&#10;and 99.79% accuracy on the D0 dataset, respectively).

Behavior trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robot&#10;task planning for their modularity and flexibility, but manually designing them&#10;can be effort&#45;intensive. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been&#10;applied in robotic task planning for generating action sequences, but their&#10;ability to generate BTs has not been fully investigated. To this end, We&#10;propose LLM as BT&#45;planner, a novel framework to leverage LLMs for BT generation&#10;in robotic assembly task planning and execution. Four in&#45;context learning&#10;methods are introduced to utilize the natural language processing and inference&#10;capabilities of LLMs to produce task plans in BT format, reducing manual effort&#10;and ensuring robustness and comprehensibility. We also evaluate the performance&#10;of fine&#45;tuned, fewer&#45;parameter LLMs on the same tasks. Experiments in simulated&#10;and real&#45;world settings show that our framework enhances LLMs&#39; performance in&#10;BT generation, improving success rates in BT generation through in&#45;context&#10;learning and supervised fine&#45;tuning.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10444v1) |&#10;| The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration. II.&#10; &#160;Mid&#45;Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy | Karl D. Gordon, G. C. Sloan, Macarena Garcia Marin, Mattia Libralato, George Rieke, Jonathan A. Aguilar, Ralph Bohlin, Misty Cracraft, Marjorie Decleir, Andras Gaspar, David R. Law, Alberto Noriega&#45;Crespo, Michael Regan | &#160;&#160;The absolute flux calibration of the Mid&#45;Infrared Instrument Imaging and&#10;Coronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first&#10;2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the&#10;flux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays,&#10;and different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining&#10;observed aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions&#10;based on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of&#10;these observations were combined with model point&#45;spread&#45;functions to measure&#10;the corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with&#10;time, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time,&#10;rate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations&#10;were with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately&#10;every month revealed a modest time&#45;dependent response loss seen mainly at the&#10;longest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential&#10;with a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the&#10;band&#45;dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was&#10;found to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different&#10;subarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting&#10;for the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors&#10;measured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The&#10;formal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are&#10;0.3 to 1.0%, with longer&#45;wavelength bands generally having larger&#10;uncertainties.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10443v1) |&#10;| CtRNet&#45;X: Camera&#45;to&#45;Robot Pose Estimation in Real&#45;world Conditions Using&#10; &#160;a Single Camera | Jingpei Lu, Zekai Liang, Tristin Xie, Florian Ritcher, Shan Lin, Sainan Liu, Michael C. Yip | &#160;&#160;Camera&#45;to&#45;robot calibration is crucial for vision&#45;based robot control and&#10;requires effort to make it accurate. Recent advancements in markerless pose&#10;estimation methods have eliminated the need for time&#45;consuming physical setups&#10;for camera&#45;to&#45;robot calibration. While the existing markerless pose estimation&#10;methods have demonstrated impressive accuracy without the need for cumbersome&#10;setups, they rely on the assumption that all the robot joints are visible&#10;within the camera&#39;s field of view. However, in practice, robots usually move in&#10;and out of view, and some portion of the robot may stay out&#45;of&#45;frame during the&#10;whole manipulation task due to real&#45;world constraints, leading to a lack of&#10;sufficient visual features and subsequent failure of these approaches. To&#10;address this challenge and enhance the applicability to vision&#45;based robot&#10;control, we propose a novel framework capable of estimating the robot pose with&#10;partially visible robot manipulators. Our approach leverages the&#10;Vision&#45;Language Models for fine&#45;grained robot components detection, and&#10;integrates it into a keypoint&#45;based pose estimation network, which enables more&#10;robust performance in varied operational conditions. The framework is evaluated&#10;on both public robot datasets and self&#45;collected partial&#45;view datasets to&#10;demonstrate our robustness and generalizability. As a result, this method is&#10;effective for robot pose estimation in a wider range of real&#45;world manipulation&#10;scenarios.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10441v1) |&#10;| Successive topological phase transitions in two distinct spin&#45;flop&#10; &#160;phases on the honeycomb lattice | Xudong Li, Jize Zhao, Jinbin Li, Qiang Luo | &#160;&#160;The Kitaev magnets with bond&#45;dependent interactions have garnered&#10;considerable attention in recent years for their ability to harbor exotic&#10;phases and nontrivial excitations. The topological magnons, which are indicated&#10;by nonzero Chern number and thermal Hall conductivity, are proposed to&#10;partially explain thermal Hall measurements in real materials. Hitherto,&#10;topological magnons have been extensively explored when the magnetic field is&#10;normal to the honeycomb plane, but their topological characteristics are less&#10;studied in the presence of in&#45;plane magnetic field. Here, we study two distinct&#10;in&#45;plane field induced spin&#45;flop phases in the $Gamma$&#45;$Gamma&#39;$ model, both&#10;of which are off&#45;diagonal couplings that have intimate relation to the Kitaev&#10;interaction. The two spin&#45;flop phases are distinguished by their out&#45;of&#45;plane&#10;spin components which can be either antiparallel or parallel, thus dubbing&#10;antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) spin&#45;flop phases, respectively.&#10;We map out topological phase diagrams for both phases, revealing a rich pattern&#10;of the Chern number over exchange parameters and magnetic field. We&#10;analytically calculate the boundaries of topological phase transitions when the&#10;magnetic field is along the $a$ and $b$ directions. We find that the thermal&#10;Hall conductivity and its derivative display contrasting behaviors when&#10;crossing different topological phase transitions. The striking difference of&#10;the two phases lies in that when the magnetic field is along the $b$ direction,&#10;topological magnons are totally absent in the AFM spin&#45;flop phase, while they&#10;can survive in the FM analogue in certain parameter regions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10439v1) |&#10;| A functorial approach to $n$&#45;abelian categories | Vitor Gulisz | &#160;&#160;We develop a functorial approach to the study of $n$&#45;abelian categories by&#10;reformulating their axioms in terms of their categories of finitely presented&#10;functors. Such an approach allows the use of classical homological algebra and&#10;representation theory techniques to understand higher homological algebra. As&#10;an application, we present two possible generalizations of the axioms &quot;every&#10;monomorphism is a kernel&quot; and &quot;every epimorphism is a cokernel&quot; of an abelian&#10;category to $n$&#45;abelian categories. We also specialize our results to modules&#10;over rings, thereby describing when the category of finitely generated&#10;projective modules over a ring is $n$&#45;abelian. Moreover, we establish a&#10;correspondence for $n$&#45;abelian categories with additive generators, which&#10;extends the higher Auslander correspondence.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10438v1) |&#10;| Color symmetry breaking in the Potts spin glass | Jean&#45;Christophe Mourrat | &#160;&#160;The Potts spin glass is an analogue of the Sherrington&#45;Kirkpatrick model in&#10;which each spin can take one of $kappa$ possible values, which we interpret as&#10;colors. It was suggested in arXiv:2310.06745 that the order parameter for this&#10;model is always invariant with respect to permutations of the colors. We show&#10;here that this is false whenever $kappa ge 58$.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10437v1) |&#10;| Infector characteristics exposed by spatial analysis of SARS&#45;CoV&#45;2&#10; &#160;sequence and demographic data analysed at fine geographical scales | Anna Gamża, Samantha Lycett, Will Harvey, Joseph Hughes, Sema Nickbakhsh, David L Robertson, Alison Smith Palmer, Anthony Wood, Rowland Kao | &#160;&#160;Characterising drivers of SARS&#45;CoV&#45;2 circulation is crucial for understanding&#10;COVID&#45;19 because of the severity of control measures adopted during the&#10;pandemic. Whole genome sequence data augmented with demographic metadata&#10;provides the best opportunity to do this. We use Random Forest Decision Tree&#10;models to analyse a combination of over 4000 SARS&#45;CoV2 sequences from a densely&#10;sampled, mixed urban and rural population (Tayside) in Scotland in the period&#10;from August 2020 to July 2021, with fine scale geographical and&#10;socio&#45;demographic metadata. Comparing periods in versus out of &quot;lockdown&quot;&#10;restrictions, we show using genetic distance relationships that individuals&#10;from more deprived areas are more likely to get infected during lockdown but&#10;less likely to spread the infection further. As disadvantaged communities were&#10;the most affected by both COVID&#45;19 and its restrictions, our finding has&#10;important implications for informing future approaches to control future&#10;pandemics driven by similar respiratory infections.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10436v1) |&#10;| A study of pure multi&#45;strange hadrons production in Pb+Pb collisions at&#10; &#160;LHC energies using HYDJET++ model | Gauri Devi, B. K. Singh | &#160;&#160;For the present work, we have used the HYDJET++ model to explore the&#10;production of pure multi&#45;strange hadrons in Pb+Pb collisions at&#10;$sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 2.76 TeV and $sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 5.02 TeV collision energies,&#10;respectively. We have simulated the $p_{T}$&#45;spectra and elliptic flow ($v_{2}$)&#10;of $phi$&#45;meson and $Omega$&#45;baryons comparing our results with ALICE&#10;experimental data and several phenomenological models (HIJING/$Boverline{B}$,&#10;VISHNU, EPOS, AMPT, and Krakow) across various centrality intervals.&#10;Additionally, we have calculated the nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$ and&#10;$R_{CP}$), which provide a perception of jet quenching phenomena. Hence, our&#10;findings enable the study of the energy and system dependence of $phi$ and&#10;$Omega$ hadrons production over a wide range of ultra&#45;relativistic collision&#10;energies. We also present the particle ratios ($Omega/phi$,&#10;$overline{Omega}^{+}/Omega^{&#45;}$, $Omega/pi$, and $phi/pi$), offering&#10;insights on the strangeness enhancement and chemical properties of the medium&#10;at both LHC collision energies.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10435v1) |&#10;| Magnetic metamaterials by ion&#45;implantation | Christina Vantaraki, Petter Ström, Tuan T. Tran, Matías P. Grassi, Giovanni Fevola, Michael Foerster, Jerzy T. Sadowski, Daniel Primetzhofer, Vassilios Kapaklis | &#160;&#160;We present a method for the additive fabrication of planar magnetic&#10;nanoarrays with minimal surface roughness. Synthesis is accomplished by&#10;combining electron&#45;beam lithography, used to generate nanometric patterned&#10;masks, with ion implantation in thin films. By implanting $^{56}$Fe$^{+}$ ions,&#10;we are able to introduce magnetic functionality in a controlled manner into&#10;continuous Pd thin films, achieving 3D spatial resolution down to a few tens of&#10;nanometers. Our results demonstrate the successful application of this&#10;technique in fabricating square artificial spin ice lattices, which exhibit&#10;well&#45;defined magnetization textures and interactions among the patterned&#10;magnetic elements.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10433v1) |&#10;| Structure&#45;preserving learning for multi&#45;symplectic PDEs | Süleyman Yıldız, Pawan Goyal, Peter Benner | &#160;&#160;This paper presents an energy&#45;preserving machine learning method for&#10;inferring reduced&#45;order models (ROMs) by exploiting the multi&#45;symplectic form&#10;of partial differential equations (PDEs). The vast majority of&#10;energy&#45;preserving reduced&#45;order methods use symplectic Galerkin projection to&#10;construct reduced&#45;order Hamiltonian models by projecting the full models onto a&#10;symplectic subspace. However, symplectic projection requires the existence of&#10;fully discrete operators, and in many cases, such as black&#45;box PDE solvers,&#10;these operators are inaccessible. In this work, we propose an energy&#45;preserving&#10;machine learning method that can infer the dynamics of the given PDE using data&#10;only, so that the proposed framework does not depend on the fully discrete&#10;operators. In this context, the proposed method is non&#45;intrusive. The proposed&#10;method is grey box in the sense that it requires only some basic knowledge of&#10;the multi&#45;symplectic model at the partial differential equation level. We prove&#10;that the proposed method satisfies spatially discrete local energy conservation&#10;and preserves the multi&#45;symplectic conservation laws. We test our method on the&#10;linear wave equation, the Korteweg&#45;de Vries equation, and the&#10;Zakharov&#45;Kuznetsov equation. We test the generalization of our learned models&#10;by testing them far outside the training time interval.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10432v1) |&#10;| Hippocampal synchronization in a realistic CA1 neuron model | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore | &#160;&#160;This work delves into studying the synchronization in two realistic neuron&#10;models using Hodgkin&#45;Huxley dynamics. Unlike simplistic point&#45;like models,&#10;excitatory synapses are here randomly distributed along the dendrites,&#10;introducing strong stochastic contributions into their signal propagation. To&#10;focus on the role of different excitatory positions, we use two copies of the&#10;same neuron whose synapses are located at different distances from the soma and&#10;are exposed to identical Poissonian distributed current pulses. The&#10;synchronization is investigated through a specifically defined spiking&#10;correlation function, and its behavior is analyzed as a function of several&#10;parameters: inhibition weight, distance from the soma of one synaptic group,&#10;excitatory inactivation delay, and weight of the excitatory synapses.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10431v1) |&#10;| Meta&#45;Whisper: Speech&#45;Based Meta&#45;ICL for ASR on Low&#45;Resource Languages | Ming&#45;Hao Hsu, Kuan Po Huang, Hung&#45;yi Lee | &#160;&#160;This paper presents Meta&#45;Whisper, a novel approach to improve automatic&#10;speech recognition (ASR) for low&#45;resource languages using the Whisper model. By&#10;leveraging Meta In&#45;Context Learning (Meta&#45;ICL) and a k&#45;Nearest Neighbors (KNN)&#10;algorithm for sample selection, Meta&#45;Whisper enhances Whisper&#39;s ability to&#10;recognize speech in unfamiliar languages without extensive fine&#45;tuning.&#10;Experiments on the ML&#45;SUPERB dataset show that Meta&#45;Whisper significantly&#10;reduces the Character Error Rate (CER) for low&#45;resource languages compared to&#10;the original Whisper model. This method offers a promising solution for&#10;developing more adaptable multilingual ASR systems, particularly for languages&#10;with limited resources.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10429v1) |&#10;| User&#45;Authenticated Device&#45;Independent Quantum Secure Direct&#10; &#160;Communication Protocol | Nayana Das, Saikat Basu, Goutam Paul, Vijay S. Rao | &#160;&#160;Device&#45;Independent Quantum Secure Direct Communication (DI&#45;QSDC) enhances&#10;quantum cryptography by enabling secure message transmission without relying on&#10;the trustworthiness of the devices involved. This approach mitigates risks&#10;associated with compromised or untrusted devices, common in traditional quantum&#10;communication.&#10; &#160;In this paper, we propose the first of its kind DI&#45;QSDC protocol with user&#10;identity authentication. This ensures the authenticity of both the sender and&#10;receiver prior to message exchange. We then discuss the security of the&#10;proposed protocol against common attacks, demonstrating that no eavesdropper&#10;gains any information from either the quantum or the classical channel. Next,&#10;we implement the protocol on IBM&#39;s quantum hardware and evaluate its&#10;performance in a realistic noisy environment. Additionally, by simulating&#10;common attack models, we showcase that the protocol is secure against any&#10;eavesdropper in the channel. These findings highlight the protocol&#39;s robust&#10;security and practical feasibility for real&#45;world secure quantum communication.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10427v1) |&#10;| Role of kinematic constraints in the time reversal symmetry breaking of&#10; &#160;a model active matter | Soumen Das, Shankar Ghosh, Tridib Sadhu, Juliane U Klamser | &#160;&#160;Active&#45;matter systems are inherently out&#45;of&#45;equilibrium and perform&#10;mechanical work by utilizing their internal energy sources. Breakdown of&#10;time&#45;reversal symmetry (BTRS) is a hallmark of such dissipative non&#45;equilibrium&#10;dynamics. We introduce a robust, experimentally accessible, noninvasive,&#10;quantitative measure of BTRS in terms of the Kullback&#45;Leibler divergence in&#10;collision events, demonstrated in our novel artificial active matter, comprised&#10;of battery&#45;powered spherical rolling robots whose energetics in different modes&#10;of motion can be measured with high precision. Our dimensionless measure&#10;characterizes how dissipation and internal energetics are influenced by&#10;kinematic constraints from interactions with the environment. We propose this&#10;measure of BTRS as an empirical estimate of the distance from equilibrium. An&#10;energetic insight into this departure of active matter from equilibrium comes&#10;from our demonstration of a non&#45;trivial fluctuation symmetry, which reveals a&#10;potentially universal thermodynamic characteristic of active energetics. As a&#10;many&#45;body consequence of BTRS in our experimental active system, we demonstrate&#10;the emergence of activity&#45;induced herding, which has no equilibrium analogue.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10425v1) |&#10;| Unveiling V Modes: Enhancing CMB Sensitivity to BSM Physics with a&#10; &#160;Non&#45;Ideal Half&#45;Wave Plate | N. Raffuzzi, M. Lembo, S. Giardiello, M. Gerbino, M. Lattanzi, P. Natoli, L. Pagano | &#160;&#160;V&#45;mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background is expected to be&#10;vanishingly small in the $Lambda$CDM model and, hence, usually ignored.&#10;Nonetheless, several astrophysical effects, as well as beyond standard model&#10;physics could produce it at a detectable level. A realistic half&#45;wave plate &#45;&#10;an optical element commonly used in CMB experiments to modulate the polarized&#10;signal &#45; can provide sensitivity to V modes without significantly spoiling that&#10;to linear polarization. We assess this sensitivity for some new&#45;generation CMB&#10;experiments, such as the LiteBIRD satellite, the ground&#45;based Simons&#10;Observatory and a CMB&#45;S4&#45;like experiment. We forecast the efficiency of these&#10;experiments to constrain the phenomenology of certain classes of BSM models&#10;inducing mixing of linear polarization states and generation of V modes in the&#10;CMB. We find that new&#45;generation experiments can improve current limits by&#10;1&#45;to&#45;3 orders of magnitude, depending on the data combination. The inclusion of&#10;V&#45;mode information dramatically boosts the sensitivity to these BSM models.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10424v1) |&#10;| Initial data for a deformed isolated horizon | Aleš Flandera, David Kofroň, Tomáš Ledvinka | &#160;&#160;Within the isolated horizon formalism, we investigate a static axisymmetric&#10;space&#45;time of a black hole influenced by matter in its neighborhood. To&#10;illustrate the role of ingredients and assumptions in this formalism, we first&#10;show how, in spherical symmetry, the field equations and gauge conditions imply&#10;the isolated horizon initial data leading to the Schwarzschild space&#45;time.&#10;Then, we construct the initial data for a static axisymmetric isolated horizon&#10;representing a deformed black hole. The space&#45;time description in the&#10;Bondi&#45;like coordinates is then found as a series expansion in the vicinity of&#10;the horizon. To graphically illustrate this construction, we also find a&#10;numerical solution for a black hole deformed by a particular analytic model of&#10;a thin accretion disk. We also discuss how an accretion disk affects the&#10;analytical properties of the horizon geometry.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10423v1) |&#10;| Learning Semi&#45;Supervised Medical Image Segmentation from Spatial&#10; &#160;Registration | Qianying Liu, Paul Henderson, Xiao Gu, Hang Dai, Fani Deligianni | &#160;&#160;Semi&#45;supervised medical image segmentation has shown promise in training&#10;models with limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. However,&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art methods ignore a potentially valuable source of unsupervised&#10;semantic information &#45;&#45; spatial registration transforms between image volumes.&#10;To address this, we propose CCT&#45;R, a contrastive cross&#45;teaching framework&#10;incorporating registration information. To leverage the semantic information&#10;available in registrations between volume pairs, CCT&#45;R incorporates two&#10;proposed modules: Registration Supervision Loss (RSL) and Registration&#45;Enhanced&#10;Positive Sampling (REPS). The RSL leverages segmentation knowledge derived from&#10;transforms between labeled and unlabeled volume pairs, providing an additional&#10;source of pseudo&#45;labels. REPS enhances contrastive learning by identifying&#10;anatomically&#45;corresponding positives across volumes using registration&#10;transforms. Experimental results on two challenging medical segmentation&#10;benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CCT&#45;R across&#10;various semi&#45;supervised settings, with as few as one labeled case.

A number of recent methods have shown&#10;how to perform high&#45;dimensional, unbinned unfolding using machine learning.&#10;However, one of the assumptions in all of these methods is that the detector&#10;response is accurately modeled in the Monte Carlo simulation. In practice, the&#10;detector response depends on a number of nuisance parameters that can be&#10;constrained with data. We propose a new algorithm called Profile OmniFold&#10;(POF), which works in a similar iterative manner as the OmniFold (OF) algorithm&#10;while being able to simultaneously profile the nuisance parameters.

Given a text query, RGS&#10;determines a stable grasp pose to manipulate the referred object in the robot&#39;s&#10;workspace. RGS comprises two steps: visual grounding and grasp pose estimation.&#10;Recent studies leverage powerful Vision&#45;Language Models (VLMs) for visually&#10;grounding free&#45;flowing natural language in real&#45;world robotic execution.&#10;However, comparisons in complex, cluttered environments with multiple instances&#10;of the same object are lacking. This paper introduces HiFi&#45;CS, featuring&#10;hierarchical application of Featurewise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to fuse image&#10;and text embeddings, enhancing visual grounding for complex attribute rich text&#10;queries encountered in robotic grasping. Visual grounding associates an object&#10;in 2D/3D space with natural language input and is studied in two scenarios:&#10;Closed and Open Vocabulary. HiFi&#45;CS features a lightweight decoder combined&#10;with a frozen VLM and outperforms competitive baselines in closed vocabulary&#10;settings while being 100x smaller in size. Our model can effectively guide&#10;open&#45;set object detectors like GroundedSAM to enhance open&#45;vocabulary&#10;performance. We validate our approach through real&#45;world RGS experiments using&#10;a 7&#45;DOF robotic arm, achieving 90.33% visual grounding accuracy in 15 tabletop&#10;scenes.

Papoutsis, I. E. Papadakis, C. Panagiotou, M. Dovčiak, E. Kammoun | &#160;&#160;Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to be variable across all&#10;wavelengths. Significant observational efforts have been invested in the last&#10;decade in studying their ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability. Long and&#10;densely sampled, multi&#45;wavelength monitoring campaigns of numerous Seyfert&#10;galaxies have been conducted with the aim of determining the X&#45;ray/UV/optical&#10;continuum time lags. Time&#45;lag studies can be used to constrain theoretical&#10;models. The observed time lags can be explained by thermal reprocessing of the&#10;X&#45;rays illuminating the accretion disc (known as the X&#45;ray reverberation&#10;model). However, the observed light curves contain more information that can be&#10;used to further constrain physical models. Our primary objective is to&#10;investigate whether, in addition to time lags, the X&#45;ray reverberation model&#10;can also explain the UV/optical variability amplitude of nearby Seyferts. To do&#10;this, we measured the excess variance of four sources (namely Mrk 509, NGC&#10;4151, NGC 2617, and Mrk 142) as a function of wavelength using data from&#10;archival long, multi&#45;wavelength campaigns with Swift, and ground&#45;based&#10;telescopes. We also computed the model excess variance in the case of the X&#45;ray&#10;reverberation model by determining the disc&#39;s transfer function and assuming a&#10;bending power law for the X&#45;ray power spectrum. We tested the validity of the&#10;model by comparing the measured and model variances for a range of accretion&#10;rates and X&#45;ray source heights. We conclude that the X&#45;ray thermal&#10;reverberation model can fit both the continuum, UV/optical time lags, as well&#10;as the variance in these AGNs, for the same physical parameters. Our results&#10;suggest that the accretion disc is constant and that all the observed&#10;UV/optical variations, on timescales of days and up to a few weeks, can be&#10;fully explained by the variable X&#45;rays as they illuminate the accretion disc.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10417v1) |&#10;| Local central limit theorem for Mallows measure | Alexey Bufetov, Kailun Chen | &#160;&#160;We study the statistics of the Mallows measure on permutations in the limit&#10;pioneered by Starr (2009).

Such walks, inspired by Ising&#45;like models and&#10;opinions dynamics models, are usually considered in one&#45;dimensional virtual&#10;spaces. Here, the mapping is done in such a way that the walk is directed along&#10;the $y$ axis while it can move either way along the $x$ axis. We explore the&#10;properties of such walks as the parameter representing the noise in the opinion&#10;dynamics model, responsible for a continuous phase transition, is varied. The&#10;walk features show marked differences as the system crosses the critical point.&#10;The bivariate distribution of the displacements below the critical point is a&#10;modified biased Gaussian function of x and y which is symmetric about the X&#10;axis.&#10; &#160;The marginal probability distributions can be extracted and the scaling forms&#10;of different quantities, showing power law behaviour, are obtained.

However, this convenience raises substantial concerns about&#10;unauthorized access to users&#39; privacy&#45;sensitive information, which could be&#10;further abused for illegitimate purposes like user tracking or monetization.&#10;Our study offers a targeted analysis of user privacy protection among Android&#10;third&#45;party SDKs, filling a critical gap in the Android software supply chain.&#10;It focuses on two aspects of their privacy practices, including data&#10;exfiltration and behavior&#45;policy compliance (or privacy compliance), utilizing&#10;techniques of taint analysis and large language models. It covers 158&#10;widely&#45;used SDKs from two key SDK release platforms, the official one and a&#10;large alternative one. From them, we identified 338 instances of privacy data&#10;exfiltration. On the privacy compliance, our study reveals that more than 30%&#10;of the examined SDKs fail to provide a privacy policy to disclose their data&#10;handling practices. Among those that provide privacy policies, 37% of them&#10;over&#45;collect user data, and 88% falsely claim access to sensitive data. We&#10;revisit the latest versions of the SDKs after 12 months. Our analysis&#10;demonstrates a persistent lack of improvement in these concerning trends. Based&#10;on our findings, we propose three actionable recommendations to mitigate the&#10;privacy leakage risks and enhance privacy protection for Android users.

As raw traces obscure the true temporal structure of neuron&#39;s&#10;activity, we performed a tuned filtering of the calcium concentration using two&#10;methods: a biophysical model and a kernel mapping. The former characterizes&#10;spike trains related to a particular triggering event, while the latter filters&#10;out the signal and refines the selection of the underlying neuronal response.&#10;Transitioning from traditional time series analysis to point process theory,&#10;the study explores spike&#45;time distance metrics and point pattern prototypes to&#10;describe repeated observations. We assume that the analyzed neuron&#39;s firing&#10;events, i.e. spike occurrences, are temporal point process events. In&#10;particular, the study aims to categorize 47 point patterns by depth, assuming&#10;the similarity of spike occurrences within specific depth categories. The&#10;results highlight the pivotal roles of depth and stimuli in discerning diverse&#10;temporal structures of neuron firing events, confirming the point process&#10;approach based on prototype analysis is largely useful in the classification of&#10;spike traces.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10409v1) |&#10;| Variational closures for composite homogenised fluid flows | Theo Diamantakis, Ruiao Hu | &#160;&#160;The Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport is a variational formulation of&#10;stochastic fluid dynamics introduced to model the effects of unresolved scales,&#10;whilst preserving the geometric structure of ideal fluid flows. In this work,&#10;we show that the SALT equations can arise from the decomposition of the fluid&#10;flow map into its mean and fluctuating components. The fluctuating component is&#10;realised as a prescribed stochastic diffeomorphism that introduces stochastic&#10;transport into the system and we construct it using homogenisation theory. The&#10;dynamics of the mean component are derived from a variational principle&#10;utilising particular forms of variations that preserve the composite structure&#10;of the flow. Using a new variational principle, we show that SALT equations can&#10;arise from random Lagrangians and are equivalent to random coefficient PDEs. We&#10;also demonstrate how to modify the composite flow and the associated&#10;variational principle to derive models inspired by the Lagrangian Averaged&#10;Euler&#45;Poincare (LAEP) theory.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10408v1) |&#10;| Bitcoin Transaction Behavior Modeling Based on Balance Data | Yu Zhang, Claudio Tessone | &#160;&#160;When analyzing Bitcoin users&#39; balance distribution, we observed that it&#10;follows a log&#45;normal pattern. Drawing parallels from the successful application&#10;of Gibrat&#39;s law of proportional growth in explaining city size and word&#10;frequency distributions, we tested whether the same principle could account for&#10;the log&#45;normal distribution in Bitcoin balances. However, our calculations&#10;revealed that the exponent parameters in both the drift and variance terms&#10;deviate slightly from one. This suggests that Gibrat&#39;s proportional growth rule&#10;alone does not fully explain the log&#45;normal distribution observed in Bitcoin&#10;users&#39; balances. During our exploration, we discovered an intriguing&#10;phenomenon: Bitcoin users tend to fall into two distinct categories based on&#10;their behavior, which we refer to as ``poor&quot; and ``wealthy&quot; users. Poor users,&#10;who initially purchase only a small amount of Bitcoin, tend to buy more&#10;bitcoins first and then sell out all their holdings gradually over time. The&#10;certainty of selling all their coins is higher and higher with time. In&#10;contrast, wealthy users, who acquire a large amount of Bitcoin from the start,&#10;tend to sell off their holdings over time. The speed at which they sell their&#10;bitcoins is lower and lower over time and they will hold at least a small part&#10;of their initial holdings at last. Interestingly, the wealthier the user, the&#10;larger the proportion of their balance and the higher the certainty they tend&#10;to sell. This research provided an interesting perspective to explore bitcoin&#10;users&#39; behaviors which may apply to other finance markets.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10407v1) |&#10;| Stochastic Data&#45;Driven Predictive Control: Chance&#45;Constraint&#10; &#160;Satisfaction with Identified Multi&#45;step Predictors | Haldun Balim, Andrea Carron, Melanie N. Zeilinger, Johannes Köhler | &#160;&#160;We propose a novel data&#45;driven stochastic model predictive control framework&#10;for uncertain linear systems with noisy output measurements. Our approach&#10;leverages multi&#45;step predictors to efficiently propagate uncertainty, ensuring&#10;chance constraint satisfaction with minimal conservatism. In particular, we&#10;present a strategy to identify multi&#45;step predictors and quantify the&#10;associated uncertainty using a surrogate (data&#45;driven) state space model. Then,&#10;we utilize the derived distribution to formulate a constraint tightening that&#10;ensures chance constraint satisfaction. A numerical example highlights the&#10;reduced conservatism of handling parametric uncertainty in the proposed method&#10;compared to state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art solutions.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10405v1) |&#10;| A Knowledge&#45;Enhanced Disease Diagnosis Method Based on Prompt Learning&#10; &#160;and BERT Integration | Zhang Zheng | &#160;&#160;This paper proposes a knowledge&#45;enhanced disease diagnosis method based on a&#10;prompt learning framework. The method retrieves structured knowledge from&#10;external knowledge graphs related to clinical cases, encodes it, and injects it&#10;into the prompt templates to enhance the language model&#39;s understanding and&#10;reasoning capabilities for the task.We conducted experiments on three public&#10;datasets: CHIP&#45;CTC, IMCS&#45;V2&#45;NER, and KUAKE&#45;QTR. The results show that the&#10;proposed method significantly outperforms existing models across multiple&#10;evaluation metrics, with an F1 score improvement of 2.4% on the CHIP&#45;CTC&#10;dataset, 3.1% on the IMCS&#45;V2&#45;NER dataset,and 4.2% on the KUAKE&#45;QTR dataset.&#10;Additionally,ablation studies confirmed the critical role of the knowledge&#10;injection module,as the removal of this module resulted in a significant drop&#10;in F1 score. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not&#10;only effectively improves the accuracy of disease diagnosis but also enhances&#10;the interpretability of the predictions, providing more reliable support and&#10;evidence for clinical diagnosis.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10403v1) |&#10;| A Statistical Equilibrium Approach to Adam Smith&#39;s Labor Theory of Value | Ellis Scharfenaker, Bruno Theodosio, Duncan K.

The ergodic distribution of producers implies a long&#45;run&#10;balancing of &quot;advantages to disadvantages&quot; across lines of employment and&#10;gravitation of market prices around Smith&#39;s natural prices.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10402v1) |&#10;| Hydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning in meiosis II&#10; &#160;oocytes | Weida Liao, Eric Lauga | &#160;&#160;Cytoplasmic streaming, the persistent flow of fluid inside a cell, induces&#10;intracellular transport, which plays a key role in fundamental biological&#10;processes. In meiosis II mouse oocytes (developing egg cells) awaiting&#10;fertilisation, the spindle, which is the protein structure responsible for&#10;dividing genetic material in a cell, must maintain its position near the cell&#10;cortex (the thin actin network bound to the cell membrane) for many hours.&#10;However, the cytoplasmic streaming that accompanies this stable positioning&#10;would intuitively appear to destabilise the spindle position. Here, through a&#10;combination of numerical and analytical modelling, we reveal a new,&#10;hydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning beneath the cortical cap.&#10;We show that this stability depends critically on the spindle size and the&#10;active driving from the cortex, and demonstrate that stable spindle positioning&#10;can result purely from a hydrodynamic suction force exerted on the spindle by&#10;the cytoplasmic flow. Our findings show that local fluid dynamic forces can be&#10;sufficient to stabilise the spindle, explaining robustness against&#10;perturbations not only perpendicular but also parallel to the cortex. Our&#10;results shed light on the importance of cytoplasmic streaming in mammalian&#10;meiosis.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10401v1) |&#10;| Sherpa: An Open Source Python Fitting Package | Aneta Siemiginowska, Douglas Burke, Hans Moritz Günther, Nicholas P.

Dejrah | &#160;&#160;We focus on the inflationary predictions of $beta$&#45;exponential potential&#10;models, in which the inflaton is a representation of the field delineating the&#10;size of extra&#45;dimension. Since it offers a well&#45;motivated starting point for&#10;the study of physics at very high energies, we incorporate an $R^2$ term in the&#10;Palatini gravity. In addition, afterward the inflation, the inflaton oscillates&#10;about the minimum of the inflation potential, and reheats the universe. This&#10;occurs during the reheating phase, at which the inflaton decays into the&#10;standard model particles, which fill the universe. We extend our examination by&#10;considering the reheating effects on inflationary observables by employing the&#10;different scenarios of the reheat temperature. Supposing the standard thermal&#10;history after inflation, we display the inflationary predictions, $n_s, r,&#10;mathrm{d}n_s/mathrm{d}&#10;n k$ of $beta$&#45;exponential potential with minimal&#10;coupling in Palatini $R^2$ gravity. Also, different kinds of constraints from a&#10;variety of observations, such as BICEP/Keck, Planck 2018, as well as future&#10;possible detectable sensitivities that might be reached by CMB experiments:&#10;CMB&#45;S4 and LiteBIRD are taken into account in this work. We indicate that our&#10;results are consistent with both the latest data and the future sensitivity&#10;forecasts of LiteBIRD/Planck and CMB&#45;S4. Finally, the results in this study&#10;highlight the viability of our model even in the case of the existence of more&#10;stringent constraints expected from future achievable confidence level limits.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10398v1) |&#10;| Quantifying Observational Projection Effects with a Simulation&#45;based hot&#10; &#160;CGM model | Soumya Shreeram, Johan Comparat, Andrea Merloni, Yi Zhang, Gabriele Ponti, Kirpal Nandra, John ZuHone, Ilaria Marini, Stephan Vladutescu&#45;Zopp, Paola Popesso, Ruediger Pakmor, Riccardo Seppi, Celine Peroux, Daniele Sorini | &#160;&#160;The hot phase of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) allows us to probe the&#10;inflow and outflow of gas within a galaxy, which is responsible for dictating&#10;the evolution of the galaxy. Studying the hot CGM sheds light on a better&#10;understanding of gas physics, which is crucial to inform and constrain&#10;simulation models. With the recent advances in observational measurements&#10;probing the hot CGM in X&#45;rays and tSZ, we have a new avenue for widening our&#10;knowledge of gas physics and feedback by exploiting the information from&#10;current/future observations. In this paper, we use the TNG300 hydrodynamical&#10;simulations to build a fully self&#45;consistent forward model for the hot CGM. We&#10;construct a lightcone and generate mock X&#45;ray observations. We quantify the&#10;projection effects, namely the locally correlated large&#45;scale structure in&#10;X&#45;rays and the effect due to satellite galaxies misclassified as centrals which&#10;affects the measured hot CGM galactocentric profiles in stacking experiments.&#10;We present an analytical model that describes the intrinsic X&#45;ray surface&#10;brightness profile across the stellar and halo mass bins. The increasing&#10;stellar mass bins result in decreasing values of $beta$, the exponent&#10;quantifying the slope of the intrinsic galactocentric profiles. We carry&#10;forward the current state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art by also showing the impact of the locally&#10;correlated environment on the measured X&#45;ray surface brightness profiles. We&#10;also present, for the first time, the effect of misclassified centrals in&#10;stacking experiments for three stellar mass bins: $10^{10.5&#45;11} M_odot$,&#10;$10^{11&#45;11.2} M_odot$, and $10^{11.2&#45;11.5} M_odot$. We find that the&#10;contaminating effect of the misclassified centrals on the stacked profiles&#10;increases when the stellar mass decreases.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10397v1) |&#10;| MOST: MR reconstruction Optimization for multiple downStream Tasks via&#10; &#160;continual learning | Hwihun Jeong, Se Young Chun, Jongho Lee | &#160;&#160;Deep learning&#45;based Magnetic Resonance (MR) reconstruction methods have&#10;focused on generating high&#45;quality images but they often overlook the impact on&#10;downstream tasks (e.g., segmentation) that utilize the reconstructed images.&#10;Cascading separately trained reconstruction network and downstream task network&#10;has been shown to introduce performance degradation due to error propagation&#10;and domain gaps between training datasets. To mitigate this issue, downstream&#10;task&#45;oriented reconstruction optimization has been proposed for a single&#10;downstream task. Expanding this optimization to multi&#45;task scenarios is not&#10;straightforward. In this work, we extended this optimization to sequentially&#10;introduced multiple downstream tasks and demonstrated that a single MR&#10;reconstruction network can be optimized for multiple downstream tasks by&#10;deploying continual learning (MOST). MOST integrated techniques from&#10;replay&#45;based continual learning and image&#45;guided loss to overcome catastrophic&#10;forgetting. Comparative experiments demonstrated that MOST outperformed a&#10;reconstruction network without finetuning, a reconstruction network with&#10;na&quot;ive finetuning, and conventional continual learning methods. This&#10;advancement empowers the application of a single MR reconstruction network for&#10;multiple downstream tasks.

In particular, we analyse the task of&#10;textit{multicopy state teleportation}, where Alice has $k$ identical copies of&#10;an arbitrary unknown $d$&#45;dimensional qudit state $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to teleport&#10;a single copy of $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to Bob using a maximally entangled&#10;two&#45;qudit state shared between Alice and Bob without Bob&#39;s correction. Alice&#10;may perform a joint measurement on her half of the entangled state and the $k$&#10;copies of $vertpsi&#13;angle$. We prove that the maximal probability of success&#10;for teleporting the exact state $vertpsi&#13;angle$ to Bob is&#10;$p(d,k)=frac{k}{d(k&#45;1+d)}$ and present an explicit protocol to attain this&#10;performance. Then, by utilising $k$ copies of an arbitrary target state&#10;$vertpsi&#13;angle$, we show how the multicopy state teleportation protocol can&#10;be employed to enhance the success probability of storage and retrieval of&#10;quantum programs, which aims to universally retrieve the action of an arbitrary&#10;quantum channel that is stored in a state. Our proofs make use of group&#10;representation theory methods, which may find applications beyond the problems&#10;addressed in this work.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10393v1) |&#10;| TPFL: Tsetlin&#45;Personalized Federated Learning with Confidence&#45;Based&#10; &#160;Clustering | Rasoul Jafari Gohari, Laya Aliahmadipour, Ezat Valipour | &#160;&#160;The world of Machine Learning (ML) has witnessed rapid changes in terms of&#10;new models and ways to process users data. The majority of work that has been&#10;done is focused on Deep Learning (DL) based approaches. However, with the&#10;emergence of new algorithms such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm, there&#10;is growing interest in exploring alternative approaches that may offer unique&#10;advantages in certain domains or applications. One of these domains is&#10;Federated Learning (FL), in which users privacy is of utmost importance. Due to&#10;its novelty, FL has seen a surge in the incorporation of personalization&#10;techniques to enhance model accuracy while maintaining user privacy under&#10;personalized conditions. In this work, we propose a novel approach dubbed TPFL:&#10;Tsetlin&#45;Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into&#10;clusters based on their confidence towards a specific class. In this way,&#10;clustering can benefit from two key advantages. Firstly, clients share only&#10;what they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight&#10;aggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been&#10;enough during the training. This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are&#10;non&#45;Independent and Identically Distributed (non&#45;IID). Secondly, by sharing&#10;only weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially&#10;reduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication&#10;cost. The results of TPFL demonstrated the highest accuracy on three different&#10;datasets; namely MNIST, FashionMNIST and FEMNIST.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10392v1) |&#10;| Prompt&#45;and&#45;Transfer: Dynamic Class&#45;aware Enhancement for Few&#45;shot&#10; &#160;Segmentation | Hanbo Bi, Yingchao Feng, Wenhui Diao, Peijin Wang, Yongqiang Mao, Kun Fu, Hongqi Wang, Xian Sun | &#160;&#160;For more efficient generalization to unseen domains (classes), most Few&#45;shot&#10;Segmentation (FSS) would directly exploit pre&#45;trained encoders and only&#10;fine&#45;tune the decoder, especially in the current era of large models. However,&#10;such fixed feature encoders tend to be class&#45;agnostic, inevitably activating&#10;objects that are irrelevant to the target class. In contrast, humans can&#10;effortlessly focus on specific objects in the line of sight. This paper mimics&#10;the visual perception pattern of human beings and proposes a novel and powerful&#10;prompt&#45;driven scheme, called ``Prompt and Transfer&quot; (PAT), which constructs a&#10;dynamic class&#45;aware prompting paradigm to tune the encoder for focusing on the&#10;interested object (target class) in the current task. Three key points are&#10;elaborated to enhance the prompting: 1) Cross&#45;modal linguistic information is&#10;introduced to initialize prompts for each task. 2) Semantic Prompt Transfer&#10;(SPT) that precisely transfers the class&#45;specific semantics within the images&#10;to prompts. 3) Part Mask Generator (PMG) that works in conjunction with SPT to&#10;adaptively generate different but complementary part prompts for different&#10;individuals. Surprisingly, PAT achieves competitive performance on 4 different&#10;tasks including standard FSS, Cross&#45;domain FSS (e.g., CV, medical, and remote&#10;sensing domains), Weak&#45;label FSS, and Zero&#45;shot Segmentation, setting new&#10;state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;arts on 11 benchmarks.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10389v1) |&#10;| Revising the Structure of Recurrent Neural Networks to Eliminate&#10; &#160;Numerical Derivatives in Forming Physics Informed Loss Terms with Respect to&#10; &#160;Time | Mahyar Jahani&#45;nasab, Mohamad Ali Bijarchi | &#160;&#160;Solving unsteady partial differential equations (PDEs) using recurrent neural&#10;networks (RNNs) typically requires numerical derivatives between each block of&#10;the RNN to form the physics informed loss function. However, this introduces&#10;the complexities of numerical derivatives into the training process of these&#10;models. In this study, we propose modifying the structure of the traditional&#10;RNN to enable the prediction of each block over a time interval, making it&#10;possible to calculate the derivative of the output with respect to time using&#10;the backpropagation algorithm. To achieve this, the time intervals of these&#10;blocks are overlapped, defining a mutual loss function between them.&#10;Additionally, the employment of conditional hidden states enables us to achieve&#10;a unique solution for each block. The forget factor is utilized to control the&#10;influence of the conditional hidden state on the prediction of the subsequent&#10;block. This new model, termed the Mutual Interval RNN (MI&#45;RNN), is applied to&#10;solve three different benchmarks: the Burgers equation, unsteady heat&#10;conduction in an irregular domain, and the Green vortex problem. Our results&#10;demonstrate that MI&#45;RNN can find the exact solution more accurately compared to&#10;existing RNN models. For instance, in the second problem, MI&#45;RNN achieved one&#10;order of magnitude less relative error compared to the RNN model with numerical&#10;derivatives.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10388v1) |&#10;| Sharp decay rate for eigenfunctions of perturbed periodic Schrödinger&#10; &#160;operators | Wencai Liu, Rodrigo Matos, John N.

Specifically, we consider operators&#10;of the form $H = &#45;Delta + V + v$, where $Delta$ is the discrete Laplacian,&#10;$V: mathbb{Z}^d &#13;ightarrow mathbb{R}$ is a periodic potential, and $v:&#10;mathbb{Z}^d &#13;ightarrow mathbb{C}$ represents a decaying impurity.

Key applications include the absence of embedded eigenvalues for&#10;operators with impurities decaying faster than any exponential function and the&#10;determination of sharp decay rates for eigenfunctions. Our findings extend&#10;previous works by providing precise decay conditions for impurities and&#10;analyzing different spectral regimes of $&#10;ambda$.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10387v1) |&#10;| Mamba&#45;ST: State Space Model for Efficient Style Transfer | Filippo Botti, Alex Ergasti, Leonardo Rossi, Tomaso Fontanini, Claudio Ferrari, Massimo Bertozzi, Andrea Prati | &#160;&#160;The goal of style transfer is, given a content image and a style source,&#10;generating a new image preserving the content but with the artistic&#10;representation of the style source. Most of the state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art architectures&#10;use transformers or diffusion&#45;based models to perform this task, despite the&#10;heavy computational burden that they require. In particular, transformers use&#10;self&#45; and cross&#45;attention layers which have large memory footprint, while&#10;diffusion models require high inference time. To overcome the above, this paper&#10;explores a novel design of Mamba, an emergent State&#45;Space Model (SSM), called&#10;Mamba&#45;ST, to perform style transfer. To do so, we adapt Mamba linear equation&#10;to simulate the behavior of cross&#45;attention layers, which are able to combine&#10;two separate embeddings into a single output, but drastically reducing memory&#10;usage and time complexity. We modified the Mamba&#39;s inner equations so to accept&#10;inputs from, and combine, two separate data streams. To the best of our&#10;knowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt the equations of SSMs to a vision&#10;task like style transfer without requiring any other module like&#10;cross&#45;attention or custom normalization layers. An extensive set of experiments&#10;demonstrates the superiority and efficiency of our method in performing style&#10;transfer compared to transformers and diffusion models.

Additionally, we observe a&#10;significant performance boost, with two orders of magnitude speedup ($gtrsim&#10;200times$) on a GPU compared to a single CPU core, affirming that AthenaK is&#10;well&#45;suited for exascale computing, thereby expanding the potential for&#10;breakthroughs in numerical relativity research.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10383v1) |&#10;| J&#45;UBIK: The JAX&#45;accelerated Universal Bayesian Imaging Kit | Vincent Eberle, Matteo Guardiani, Margret Westerkamp, Philipp Frank, Julian Rüstig, Julia Stadler, Torsten A. Enßlin | &#160;&#160;Many advances in astronomy and astrophysics originate from accurate images of&#10;the sky emission across multiple wavelengths. This often requires&#10;reconstructing spatially and spectrally correlated signals detected from&#10;multiple instruments. To facilitate the high&#45;fidelity imaging of these signals,&#10;we introduce the universal Bayesian imaging kit (UBIK). Specifically, we&#10;present J&#45;UBIK, a flexible and modular implementation leveraging the&#10;JAX&#45;accelerated NIFTy.re software as its backend. J&#45;UBIK streamlines the&#10;implementation of the key Bayesian inference components, providing for all the&#10;necessary steps of Bayesian imaging pipelines. First, it provides adaptable&#10;prior models for different sky realizations. Second, it includes likelihood&#10;models tailored to specific instruments. So far, the package includes three&#10;instruments: Chandra and eROSITA for X&#45;ray observations, and the James Webb&#10;Space Telescope (JWST) for the near&#45; and mid&#45;infrared. The aim is to expand&#10;this set in the future. Third, these models can be integrated with various&#10;inference and optimization schemes, such as maximum a posteriori estimation and&#10;variational inference. Explicit demos show how to integrate the individual&#10;modules into a full analysis pipeline.

Biswas, Sudin Ganguly, Chunlei Qu, Santanu K. Maiti | &#160;&#160;We present a comprehensive study on enhancing the thermoelectric (TE)&#10;performance of bilayer graphene (BLG) through irradiation with arbitrarily&#10;polarized light, focusing on $AA$&#45; and $AB$&#45;stacked configurations with zigzag&#10;edges. Utilizing a combination of tight&#45;binding theory and density functional&#10;theory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on&#10;electronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the&#10;electronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function,&#10;which significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the&#10;overall {it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT&#10;calculations reveal that $AB$&#45;stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal&#10;conductivity compared to $AA$&#45;stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic&#10;scattering and phonon group velocity. The combined analysis shows that FOM&#10;exceeds unity in both stacking types, with notable improvements near the&#10;irradiation&#45;induced gap. Additionally, we explore the dependence of FOM on the&#10;system dimensions and temperature, demonstrating that light&#45;irradiated BLG&#10;holds great promise for efficient thermoelectric energy conversion and waste&#10;heat recovery. Our results show favorable responses over a wide range of&#10;irradiation parameters. These findings provide crucial insights into optimizing&#10;BLG for advanced TE applications through light&#45;induced modifications.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10380v1) |&#10;| Leveraging Joint Spectral and Spatial Learning with MAMBA for&#10; &#160;Multichannel Speech Enhancement | Wenze Ren, Haibin Wu, Yi&#45;Cheng Lin, Xuanjun Chen, Rong Chao, Kuo&#45;Hsuan Hung, You&#45;Jin Li, Wen&#45;Yuan Ting, Hsin&#45;Min Wang, Yu Tsao | &#160;&#160;In multichannel speech enhancement, effectively capturing spatial and&#10;spectral information across different microphones is crucial for noise&#10;reduction. Traditional methods, such as CNN or LSTM, attempt to model the&#10;temporal dynamics of full&#45;band and sub&#45;band spectral and spatial features.&#10;However, these approaches face limitations in fully modeling complex temporal&#10;dependencies, especially in dynamic acoustic environments. To overcome these&#10;challenges, we modify the current advanced model McNet by introducing an&#10;improved version of Mamba, a state&#45;space model, and further propose MCMamba.&#10;MCMamba has been completely reengineered to integrate full&#45;band and narrow&#45;band&#10;spatial information with sub&#45;band and full&#45;band spectral features, providing a&#10;more comprehensive approach to modeling spatial and spectral information. Our&#10;experimental results demonstrate that MCMamba significantly improves the&#10;modeling of spatial and spectral features in multichannel speech enhancement,&#10;outperforming McNet and achieving state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art performance on the CHiME&#45;3&#10;dataset. Additionally, we find that Mamba performs exceptionally well in&#10;modeling spectral information.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10376v1) |&#10;| Nonlinear Causality in Brain Networks: With Application to Motor Imagery&#10; &#160;vs Execution | Sipan Aslan, Hernando Ombao | &#160;&#160;One fundamental challenge of data&#45;driven analysis in neuroscience is modeling&#10;causal interactions and exploring the connectivity of nodes in a brain network.&#10;Various statistical methods, relying on various perspectives and employing&#10;different data modalities, are being developed to examine and comprehend the&#10;underlying causal structures inherent to brain dynamics. This study introduces&#10;a novel statistical approach, TAR4C, to dissect causal interactions in&#10;multichannel EEG recordings. TAR4C uses the threshold autoregressive model to&#10;describe the causal interaction between nodes or clusters of nodes in a brain&#10;network. The perspective involves testing whether one node, which may represent&#10;a brain region, can control the dynamics of the other. The node that has such&#10;an impact on the other is called a threshold variable and can be classified as&#10;a causative because its functionality is the leading source operating as an&#10;instantaneous switching mechanism that regulates the time&#45;varying&#10;autoregressive structure of the other. This statistical concept is commonly&#10;referred to as threshold non&#45;linearity. Once threshold non&#45;linearity has been&#10;verified between a pair of nodes, the subsequent essential facet of TAR&#10;modeling is to assess the predictive ability of the causal node for the current&#10;activity on the other and represent causal interactions in autoregressive&#10;terms. This predictive ability is what underlies Granger causality. The TAR4C&#10;approach can discover non&#45;linear and time&#45;dependent causal interactions without&#10;negating the G&#45;causality perspective. The efficacy of the proposed approach is&#10;exemplified by analyzing the EEG signals recorded during the motor&#10;movement/imagery experiment. The similarities and differences between the&#10;causal interactions manifesting during the execution and the imagery of a given&#10;motor movement are demonstrated by analyzing EEG recordings from multiple&#10;subjects.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10374v1) |&#10;| Instigating Cooperation among LLM Agents Using Adaptive Information&#10; &#160;Modulation | Qiliang Chen, &#160;Alireza, &#160;Ilami, Nunzio Lore, Babak Heydari | &#160;&#160;This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for&#10;human strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these&#10;agents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments. Our&#10;approach extends traditional agent&#45;based simulations by using strategic LLM&#10;agents (SLA) and introducing dynamic and adaptive governance through a&#10;pro&#45;social promoting RL agent (PPA) that modulates information access across&#10;agents in a network, optimizing social welfare and promoting pro&#45;social&#10;behavior. Through validation in iterative games, including the prisoner&#10;dilemma, we demonstrate that SLA agents exhibit nuanced strategic adaptations.&#10;The PPA agent effectively learns to adjust information transparency, resulting&#10;in enhanced cooperation rates. This framework offers significant insights into&#10;AI&#45;mediated social dynamics, contributing to the deployment of AI in real&#45;world&#10;team settings.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10372v1) |&#10;| Learning Gentle Grasping from Human&#45;Free Force Control Demonstration | Mingxuan Li, Lunwei Zhang, Tiemin Li, Yao Jiang | &#160;&#160;Humans can steadily and gently grasp unfamiliar objects based on tactile&#10;perception. Robots still face challenges in achieving similar performance due&#10;to the difficulty of learning accurate grasp&#45;force predictions and force&#10;control strategies that can be generalized from limited data. In this article,&#10;we propose an approach for learning grasping from ideal force control&#10;demonstrations, to achieve similar performance of human hands with limited data&#10;size. Our approach utilizes objects with known contact characteristics to&#10;automatically generate reference force curves without human demonstrations. In&#10;addition, we design the dual convolutional neural networks (Dual&#45;CNN)&#10;architecture which incorporating a physics&#45;based mechanics module for learning&#10;target grasping force predictions from demonstrations. The described method can&#10;be effectively applied in vision&#45;based tactile sensors and enables gentle and&#10;stable grasping of objects from the ground. The described prediction model and&#10;grasping strategy were validated in offline evaluations and online experiments,&#10;and the accuracy and generalizability were demonstrated.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10371v1) |&#10;| Uncovering the Mechanism of Hepatotoxiciy of PFAS Targeting L&#45;FABP Using&#10; &#160;GCN and Computational Modeling | Lucas Jividen, Tibo Duran, Xi&#45;Zhi Niu, Jun Bai | &#160;&#160;Per&#45; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental&#10;pollutants with known toxicity and bioaccumulation issues. Their widespread&#10;industrial use and resistance to degradation have led to global environmental&#10;contamination and significant health concerns. While a minority of PFAS have&#10;been extensively studied, the toxicity of many PFAS remains poorly understood&#10;due to limited direct toxicological data. This study advances the predictive&#10;modeling of PFAS toxicity by combining semi&#45;supervised graph convolutional&#10;networks (GCNs) with molecular descriptors and fingerprints. We propose a novel&#10;approach to enhance the prediction of PFAS binding affinities by isolating&#10;molecular fingerprints to construct graphs where then descriptors are set as&#10;the node features. This approach specifically captures the structural,&#10;physicochemical, and topological features of PFAS without overfitting due to an&#10;abundance of features. Unsupervised clustering then identifies representative&#10;compounds for detailed binding studies. Our results provide a more accurate&#10;ability to estimate PFAS hepatotoxicity to provide guidance in chemical&#10;discovery of new PFAS and the development of new safety regulations.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10370v1) |&#10;| Stochastic Control of UAVs: An Optimal Tradeoff between Performance,&#10; &#160;Flight Smoothness and Control Effort | George Rapakoulias, Panagiotis Tsiotras | &#160;&#160;Safe and accurate control of unmanned aerial vehicles in the presence of&#10;winds is a challenging control problem due to the hard&#45;to&#45;model and highly&#10;stochastic nature of the disturbance forces acting upon the vehicle. To meet&#10;performance constraints, state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art control methods such as Incremental&#10;Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) or other adaptive control techniques require&#10;high control gains to mitigate the effects of uncertainty entering the system.&#10;While achieving good tracking performance, IDNI requires excessive control&#10;effort, results in high actuator strain, and reduced flight smoothness due to&#10;constant and aggressive corrective actions commanded by the controller. In this&#10;paper, we propose a novel control architecture that allows the user to&#10;systematically address the trade&#45;off between high authority control and&#10;performance constraint satisfaction. Our approach consists of two parts. To&#10;cancel out biases introduced by unmodelled aerodynamic effects we propose a&#10;hybrid, model&#45;based disturbance force estimator augmented with a neural&#10;network, that can adapt to external wind conditions using a Kalman Filter. We&#10;then utilize state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art results from Covariance Steering theory, which&#10;offers a principled way of controlling the uncertainty of the tracking error&#10;dynamics. We first analyze the properties of the combined system and then&#10;provide extensive experimental results to verify the advantages of the proposed&#10;approach over existing methods&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10369v1) |&#10;| Integrated nowcasting of convective precipitation with Transformer&#45;based&#10; &#160;models using multi&#45;source data | Çağlar Küçük, Aitor Atencia, Markus Dabernig | &#160;&#160;Precipitation nowcasting is crucial for mitigating the impacts of severe&#10;weather events and supporting daily activities. Conventional models&#10;predominantly relying on radar data have limited performance in predicting&#10;cases with complex temporal features such as convection initiation,&#10;highlighting the need to integrate data from other sources for more&#10;comprehensive nowcasting. Unlike physics&#45;based models, machine learning&#10;(ML)&#45;based models offer promising solutions for efficiently integrating large&#10;volumes of diverse data. We present EF4INCA, a spatiotemporal Transformer model&#10;for precipitation nowcasting that integrates satellite&#45; and ground&#45;based&#10;observations with numerical weather prediction outputs. EF4INCA provides&#10;high&#45;resolution forecasts over Austria, accurately predicting the location and&#10;shape of precipitation fields with a spatial resolution of 1 kilometre and a&#10;temporal resolution of 5 minutes, up to 90 minutes ahead. Our evaluation shows&#10;that EF4INCA outperforms conventional nowcasting models, including the&#10;operational model of Austria, particularly in scenarios with complex temporal&#10;features such as convective initiation and rapid weather changes. EF4INCA&#10;maintains higher accuracy in location forecasting but generates smoother fields&#10;at later prediction times compared to traditional models. Interpretation of our&#10;model showed that precipitation products and SEVIRI infrared channels CH7 and&#10;CH9 are the most important data streams. These results underscore the&#10;importance of combining data from different domains, including physics&#45;based&#10;model products, with ML approaches. Our study highlights the robustness of&#10;EF4INCA and its potential for improved precipitation nowcasting. We provide&#10;access to our code repository, model weights, and the dataset curated for&#10;benchmarking, facilitating further development and application.&#10; | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10367v1) |&#10;&#10;">
