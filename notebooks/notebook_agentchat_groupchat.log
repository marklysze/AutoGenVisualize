When you need to collect info, use the code to output the info you need, for example, browse or search the web, download/read a file, print the content of a webpage or a file, get the current date/time, check the operating system. After sufficient info is printed and the task is ready to be solved based on your language skill, you can solve the task by yourself.\n    2. When you need to perform some task with code, use the code to perform the task and output the result. Finish the task smartly.\nSolve the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. Be clear which step uses code, and which step uses your language skill.\nWhen using code, you must indicate the script type in the code block. The user cannot provide any other feedback or perform any other action beyond executing the code you suggest. The user can't modify your code. So do not suggest incomplete code which requires users to modify. Don't use a code block if it's not intended to be executed by the user.\nIf you want the user to save the code in a file before executing it, put # filename: <filename> inside the code block as the first line. Don't include multiple code blocks in one response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant. Check the execution result returned by the user.\nIf the result indicates there is an error, fix the error and output the code again. Suggest the full code instead of partial code or code changes. If the error can't be fixed or if the task is not solved even after the code is executed successfully, analyze the problem, revisit your assumption, collect additional info you need, and think of a different approach to try.\nWhen you find an answer, verify the answer carefully.

How adept is\\nmodern AI at these inferences? We introduce an evaluation framework for testing\\naffective cognition in foundation models. Starting from psychological theory,\\nwe generate 1,280 diverse scenarios exploring relationships between appraisals,\\nemotions, expressions, and outcomes. We evaluate the abilities of foundation\\nmodels (GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini-1.5-Pro) and humans (N = 567) across carefully\\nselected conditions. Our results show foundation models tend to agree with\\nhuman intuitions, matching or exceeding interparticipant agreement. In some\\nconditions, models are ``superhuman'' -- they better predict modal human\\njudgements than the average human. All models benefit from chain-of-thought\\nreasoning. This suggests foundation models have acquired a human-like\\nunderstanding of emotions and their influence on beliefs and behavior.\\n\\nTitle: From Lists to Emojis: How Format Bias Affects Model Alignment\\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11704v1\\nSummary: In this paper, we study format biases in reinforcement learning from human\\nfeedback (RLHF). We observe that many widely-used preference models, including\\nhuman evaluators, GPT-4, and top-ranking models on the RewardBench benchmark,\\nexhibit strong biases towards specific format patterns, such as lists, links,\\nbold text, and emojis. Furthermore, large language models (LLMs) can exploit\\nthese biases to achieve higher rankings on popular benchmarks like AlpacaEval\\nand LMSYS Chatbot Arena. One notable example of this is verbosity bias, where\\ncurrent preference models favor longer responses that appear more\\ncomprehensive, even when their quality is equal to or lower than shorter,\\ncompeting responses. However, format biases beyond verbosity remain largely\\nunderexplored in the literature. In this work, we extend the study of biases in\\npreference learning beyond the commonly recognized length bias, offering a\\ncomprehensive analysis of a wider range of format biases. Additionally, we show\\nthat with a small amount of biased data (less than 1%), we can inject\\nsignificant bias into the reward model. Moreover, these format biases can also\\nbe easily exploited by downstream alignment algorithms, such as best-of-n\\nsampling and online iterative DPO, as it is usually easier to manipulate the\\nformat than to improve the quality of responses. Our findings emphasize the\\nneed to disentangle format and content both for designing alignment algorithms\\nand evaluating models.\\n\\nTitle: Harnessing LLMs for API Interactions: A Framework for Classification and Synthetic Data Generation\\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11703v1\\nSummary: As Large Language Models (LLMs) advance in natural language processing, there\\nis growing interest in leveraging their capabilities to simplify software\\ninteractions. In this paper, we propose a novel system that integrates LLMs for\\nboth classifying natural language inputs into corresponding API calls and\\nautomating the creation of sample datasets tailored to specific API functions.\\nBy classifying natural language commands, our system allows users to invoke\\ncomplex software functionalities through simple inputs, improving interaction\\nefficiency and lowering the barrier to software utilization. Our dataset\\ngeneration approach also enables the efficient and systematic evaluation of\\ndifferent LLMs in classifying API calls, offering a practical tool for\\ndevelopers or business owners to assess the suitability of LLMs for customized\\nAPI management. We conduct experiments on several prominent LLMs using\\ngenerated sample datasets for various API functions. The results show that\\nGPT-4 achieves a high classification accuracy of 0.996, while LLaMA-3-8B\\nperforms much worse at 0.759. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to\\ntransform API management and validate the effectiveness of our system in\\nguiding model testing and selection across diverse applications.\\n\\nTitle: Hackphyr: A Local Fine-Tuned LLM Agent for Network Security Environments\\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11276v1\\nSummary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential across various\\ndomains, including cybersecurity. Using commercial cloud-based LLMs may be\\nundesirable due to privacy concerns, costs, and network connectivity\\nconstraints. In this paper, we present Hackphyr, a locally fine-tuned LLM to be\\nused as a red-team agent within network security environments. Our fine-tuned 7\\nbillion parameter model can run on a single GPU card and achieves performance\\ncomparable with much larger and more powerful commercial models such as GPT-4.\\nHackphyr clearly outperforms other models, including GPT-3.5-turbo, and\\nbaselines, such as Q-learning agents in complex, previously unseen scenarios.\\nTo achieve this performance, we generated a new task-specific cybersecurity\\ndataset to enhance the base model's capabilities. Finally, we conducted a\\ncomprehensive analysis of the agents' behaviors that provides insights into the\\nplanning abilities and potential shortcomings of such agents, contributing to\\nthe broader understanding of LLM-based agents in cybersecurity contexts\\n\\nTitle: Investigating Context-Faithfulness in Large Language Models: The Roles of Memory Strength and Evidence Style\\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10955v1\\nSummary: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves Large Language Models (LLMs) by\\nincorporating external information into the response generation process.\\nHowever, how context-faithful LLMs are and what factors influence LLMs'\\ncontext-faithfulness remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate\\nthe impact of memory strength and evidence presentation on LLMs' receptiveness\\nto external evidence. We introduce a method to quantify the memory strength of\\nLLMs by measuring the divergence in LLMs' responses to different paraphrases of\\nthe same question, which is not considered by previous works. We also generate\\nevidence in various styles to evaluate the effects of evidence in different\\nstyles.

This paper enhances\\nSynthetic Control methods by introducing \\\"Transformed Control\\\", a novel method\\nthat employs Large Language Models (LLMs) powered by Artificial Intelligence to\\ngenerate control groups. We utilize OpenAI's API to generate a control group\\nwhere GPT-4, or ChatGPT, takes multiple SATs annually from 2008 to 2023. This\\ncontrol group helps analyze shifts in SAT math difficulty over time, starting\\nfrom the baseline year of 2008. Using parallel trends, we calculate the Average\\nDifference in Scores (ADS) to assess changes in high school students' math\\nperformance. Our results indicate a significant decrease in the difficulty of\\nthe SAT math section over time, alongside a decline in students' math\\nperformance. The analysis shows a 71-point drop in the rigor of SAT math from\\n2008 to 2023, with student performance decreasing by 36 points, resulting in a\\n107-point total divergence in average student math performance. We investigate\\npossible mechanisms for this decline in math proficiency, such as changing\\nuniversity selection criteria, increased screen time, grade inflation, and\\nworsening adolescent mental health. Disparities among demographic groups show a\\n104-point drop for White students, 84 points for Black students, and 53 points\\nfor Asian students. Male students saw a 117-point reduction, while female\\nstudents had a 100-point decrease.\\n\\nTitle: LLMs for clinical risk prediction\\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10191v1\\nSummary: This study compares the efficacy of GPT-4 and clinalytix Medical AI in\\npredicting the clinical risk of delirium development. Findings indicate that\\nGPT-4 exhibited significant deficiencies in identifying positive cases and\\nstruggled to provide reliable probability estimates for delirium risk, while\\nclinalytix Medical AI demonstrated superior accuracy. A thorough analysis of\\nthe large language model's (LLM) outputs elucidated potential causes for these\\ndiscrepancies, consistent with limitations reported in extant literature. These\\nresults underscore the challenges LLMs face in accurately diagnosing conditions\\nand interpreting complex clinical data. While LLMs hold substantial potential\\nin healthcare, they are currently unsuitable for independent clinical\\ndecision-making. Instead, they should be employed in assistive roles,\\ncomplementing clinical expertise. Continued human oversight remains essential\\nto ensure optimal outcomes for both patients and healthcare providers.\\n\\nTitle: MindGuard: Towards Accessible and Sitgma-free Mental Health First Aid via Edge LLM\\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10064v1\\nSummary: Mental health disorders are among the most prevalent diseases worldwide,\\naffecting nearly one in four people. Despite their widespread impact, the\\nintervention rate remains below 25%, largely due to the significant cooperation\\nrequired from patients for both diagnosis and intervention. The core issue\\nbehind this low treatment rate is stigma, which discourages over half of those\\naffected from seeking help. This paper presents MindGuard, an accessible,\\nstigma-free, and professional mobile mental healthcare system designed to\\nprovide mental health first aid. The heart of MindGuard is an innovative edge\\nLLM, equipped with professional mental health knowledge, that seamlessly\\nintegrates objective mobile sensor data with subjective Ecological Momentary\\nAssessment records to deliver personalized screening and intervention\\nconversations. We conduct a broad evaluation of MindGuard using open datasets\\nspanning four years and real-world deployment across various mobile devices\\ninvolving 20 subjects for two weeks. Remarkably, MindGuard achieves results\\ncomparable to GPT-4 and outperforms its counterpart with more than 10 times the\\nmodel size. We believe that MindGuard paves the way for mobile LLM\\napplications, potentially revolutionizing mental healthcare practices by\\nsubstituting self-reporting and intervention conversations with passive,\\nintegrated monitoring within daily life, thus ensuring accessible and\\nstigma-free mental health support.\\n\\nTitle: SelECT-SQL: Self-correcting ensemble Chain-of-Thought for Text-to-SQL\\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10007v1\\nSummary: In recent years,Text-to-SQL, the problem of automatically converting\\nquestions posed in natural language to formal SQL queries, has emerged as an\\nimportant problem at the intersection of natural language processing and data\\nmanagement research. Large language models (LLMs) have delivered impressive\\nperformance when used in an off-the-shelf performance, but still fall\\nsignificantly short of expected expert-level performance. Errors are especially\\nprobable when a nuanced understanding is needed of database schemas, questions,\\nand SQL clauses to do proper Text-to-SQL conversion. We introduce SelECT-SQL, a\\nnovel in-context learning solution that uses an algorithmic combination of\\nchain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, self-correction, and ensemble methods to\\nyield a new state-of-the-art result on challenging Text-to-SQL benchmarks.\\nSpecifically, when configured using GPT-3.5-Turbo as the base LLM, SelECT-SQL\\nachieves 84.2% execution accuracy on the Spider leaderboard's development set,\\nexceeding both the best results of other baseline GPT-3.5-Turbo-based solutions\\n(81.1%), and the peak performance (83.5%) of the GPT-4 result reported on the\\nleaderboard.\\n\\nTitle: GP-GPT: Large Language Model for Gene-Phenotype Mapping\\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09825v1\\nSummary: Pre-trained large language models(LLMs) have attracted increasing attention\\nin biomedical domains due to their success in natural language processing.\\nHowever, the complex traits and heterogeneity of multi-sources genomics data\\npose significant challenges when adapting these models to the bioinformatics\\nand biomedical field. To address these challenges, we present GP-GPT, the first\\nspecialized large language model for genetic-phenotype knowledge representation\\nand genomics relation analysis. Our model is fine-tuned in two stages on a\\ncomprehensive corpus composed of over 3,000,000 terms in genomics, proteomics,\\nand medical genetics, derived from multiple large-scale validated datasets and\\nscientific publications. GP-GPT demonstrates proficiency in accurately\\nretrieving medical genetics information and performing common genomics analysis\\ntasks, such as genomics information retrieval and relationship determination.\\nComparative experiments across domain-specific tasks reveal that GP-GPT\\noutperforms state-of-the-art LLMs, including Llama2, Llama3 and GPT-4. These\\nresults highlight GP-GPT's potential to enhance genetic disease relation\\nresearch and facilitate accurate and efficient analysis in the fields of\\ngenomics and medical genetics. Our investigation demonstrated the subtle\\nchanges of bio-factor entities' representations in the GP-GPT, which suggested\\nthe opportunities for the application of LLMs to advancing gene-phenotype\\nresearch.\\n\\n\"}", "timestamp": "2024-09-23 03:50:53.266603", "thread_id": 140548155788160}

How adept is\\nmodern AI at these inferences? We introduce an evaluation framework for testing\\naffective cognition in foundation models. Starting from psychological theory,\\nwe generate 1,280 diverse scenarios exploring relationships between appraisals,\\nemotions, expressions, and outcomes. We evaluate the abilities of foundation\\nmodels (GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini-1.5-Pro) and humans (N = 567) across carefully\\nselected conditions. Our results show foundation models tend to agree with\\nhuman intuitions, matching or exceeding interparticipant agreement. In some\\nconditions, models are ``superhuman'' -- they better predict modal human\\njudgements than the average human. All models benefit from chain-of-thought\\nreasoning. This suggests foundation models have acquired a human-like\\nunderstanding of emotions and their influence on beliefs and behavior.\\n\\nTitle: From Lists to Emojis: How Format Bias Affects Model Alignment\\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11704v1\\nSummary: In this paper, we study format biases in reinforcement learning from human\\nfeedback (RLHF). We observe that many widely-used preference models, including\\nhuman evaluators, GPT-4, and top-ranking models on the RewardBench benchmark,\\nexhibit strong biases towards specific format patterns, such as lists, links,\\nbold text, and emojis. Furthermore, large language models (LLMs) can exploit\\nthese biases to achieve higher rankings on popular benchmarks like AlpacaEval\\nand LMSYS Chatbot Arena. One notable example of this is verbosity bias, where\\ncurrent preference models favor longer responses that appear more\\ncomprehensive, even when their quality is equal to or lower than shorter,\\ncompeting responses. However, format biases beyond verbosity remain largely\\nunderexplored in the literature. In this work, we extend the study of biases in\\npreference learning beyond the commonly recognized length bias, offering a\\ncomprehensive analysis of a wider range of format biases. Additionally, we show\\nthat with a small amount of biased data (less than 1%), we can inject\\nsignificant bias into the reward model. Moreover, these format biases can also\\nbe easily exploited by downstream alignment algorithms, such as best-of-n\\nsampling and online iterative DPO, as it is usually easier to manipulate the\\nformat than to improve the quality of responses. Our findings emphasize the\\nneed to disentangle format and content both for designing alignment algorithms\\nand evaluating models.\\n\\nTitle: Harnessing LLMs for API Interactions: A Framework for Classification and Synthetic Data Generation\\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11703v1\\nSummary: As Large Language Models (LLMs) advance in natural language processing, there\\nis growing interest in leveraging their capabilities to simplify software\\ninteractions. In this paper, we propose a novel system that integrates LLMs for\\nboth classifying natural language inputs into corresponding API calls and\\nautomating the creation of sample datasets tailored to specific API functions.\\nBy classifying natural language commands, our system allows users to invoke\\ncomplex software functionalities through simple inputs, improving interaction\\nefficiency and lowering the barrier to software utilization. Our dataset\\ngeneration approach also enables the efficient and systematic evaluation of\\ndifferent LLMs in classifying API calls, offering a practical tool for\\ndevelopers or business owners to assess the suitability of LLMs for customized\\nAPI management. We conduct experiments on several prominent LLMs using\\ngenerated sample datasets for various API functions. The results show that\\nGPT-4 achieves a high classification accuracy of 0.996, while LLaMA-3-8B\\nperforms much worse at 0.759.

Despite their widespread impact, the\\nintervention rate remains below 25%, largely due to the significant cooperation\\nrequired from patients for both diagnosis and intervention. The core issue\\nbehind this low treatment rate is stigma, which discourages over half of those\\naffected from seeking help. This paper presents MindGuard, an accessible,\\nstigma-free, and professional mobile mental healthcare system designed to\\nprovide mental health first aid. The heart of MindGuard is an innovative edge\\nLLM, equipped with professional mental health knowledge, that seamlessly\\nintegrates objective mobile sensor data with subjective Ecological Momentary\\nAssessment records to deliver personalized screening and intervention\\nconversations. We conduct a broad evaluation of MindGuard using open datasets\\nspanning four years and real-world deployment across various mobile devices\\ninvolving 20 subjects for two weeks. Remarkably, MindGuard achieves results\\ncomparable to GPT-4 and outperforms its counterpart with more than 10 times the\\nmodel size. We believe that MindGuard paves the way for mobile LLM\\napplications, potentially revolutionizing mental healthcare practices by\\nsubstituting self-reporting and intervention conversations with passive,\\nintegrated monitoring within daily life, thus ensuring accessible and\\nstigma-free mental health support.\\n\\nTitle: SelECT-SQL: Self-correcting ensemble Chain-of-Thought for Text-to-SQL\\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10007v1\\nSummary: In recent years,Text-to-SQL, the problem of automatically converting\\nquestions posed in natural language to formal SQL queries, has emerged as an\\nimportant problem at the intersection of natural language processing and data\\nmanagement research. Large language models (LLMs) have delivered impressive\\nperformance when used in an off-the-shelf performance, but still fall\\nsignificantly short of expected expert-level performance. Errors are especially\\nprobable when a nuanced understanding is needed of database schemas, questions,\\nand SQL clauses to do proper Text-to-SQL conversion. We introduce SelECT-SQL, a\\nnovel in-context learning solution that uses an algorithmic combination of\\nchain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, self-correction, and ensemble methods to\\nyield a new state-of-the-art result on challenging Text-to-SQL benchmarks.\\nSpecifically, when configured using GPT-3.5-Turbo as the base LLM, SelECT-SQL\\nachieves 84.2% execution accuracy on the Spider leaderboard's development set,\\nexceeding both the best results of other baseline GPT-3.5-Turbo-based solutions\\n(81.1%), and the peak performance (83.5%) of the GPT-4 result reported on the\\nleaderboard.\\n\\nTitle: GP-GPT: Large Language Model for Gene-Phenotype Mapping\\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09825v1\\nSummary: Pre-trained large language models(LLMs) have attracted increasing attention\\nin biomedical domains due to their success in natural language processing.\\nHowever, the complex traits and heterogeneity of multi-sources genomics data\\npose significant challenges when adapting these models to the bioinformatics\\nand biomedical field. To address these challenges, we present GP-GPT, the first\\nspecialized large language model for genetic-phenotype knowledge representation\\nand genomics relation analysis. Our model is fine-tuned in two stages on a\\ncomprehensive corpus composed of over 3,000,000 terms in genomics, proteomics,\\nand medical genetics, derived from multiple large-scale validated datasets and\\nscientific publications.

How adept is\\nmodern AI at these inferences? We introduce an evaluation framework for testing\\naffective cognition in foundation models. Starting from psychological theory,\\nwe generate 1,280 diverse scenarios exploring relationships between appraisals,\\nemotions, expressions, and outcomes. We evaluate the abilities of foundation\\nmodels (GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini-1.5-Pro) and humans (N = 567) across carefully\\nselected conditions. Our results show foundation models tend to agree with\\nhuman intuitions, matching or exceeding interparticipant agreement. In some\\nconditions, models are ``superhuman'' -- they better predict modal human\\njudgements than the average human. All models benefit from chain-of-thought\\nreasoning. This suggests foundation models have acquired a human-like\\nunderstanding of emotions and their influence on beliefs and behavior.\\n\\nTitle: From Lists to Emojis: How Format Bias Affects Model Alignment\\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11704v1\\nSummary: In this paper, we study format biases in reinforcement learning from human\\nfeedback (RLHF). We observe that many widely-used preference models, including\\nhuman evaluators, GPT-4, and top-ranking models on the RewardBench benchmark,\\nexhibit strong biases towards specific format patterns, such as lists, links,\\nbold text, and emojis. Furthermore, large language models (LLMs) can exploit\\nthese biases to achieve higher rankings on popular benchmarks like AlpacaEval\\nand LMSYS Chatbot Arena. One notable example of this is verbosity bias, where\\ncurrent preference models favor longer responses that appear more\\ncomprehensive, even when their quality is equal to or lower than shorter,\\ncompeting responses. However, format biases beyond verbosity remain largely\\nunderexplored in the literature. In this work, we extend the study of biases in\\npreference learning beyond the commonly recognized length bias, offering a\\ncomprehensive analysis of a wider range of format biases. Additionally, we show\\nthat with a small amount of biased data (less than 1%), we can inject\\nsignificant bias into the reward model. Moreover, these format biases can also\\nbe easily exploited by downstream alignment algorithms, such as best-of-n\\nsampling and online iterative DPO, as it is usually easier to manipulate the\\nformat than to improve the quality of responses. Our findings emphasize the\\nneed to disentangle format and content both for designing alignment algorithms\\nand evaluating models.\\n\\nTitle: Harnessing LLMs for API Interactions: A Framework for Classification and Synthetic Data Generation\\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11703v1\\nSummary: As Large Language Models (LLMs) advance in natural language processing, there\\nis growing interest in leveraging their capabilities to simplify software\\ninteractions. In this paper, we propose a novel system that integrates LLMs for\\nboth classifying natural language inputs into corresponding API calls and\\nautomating the creation of sample datasets tailored to specific API functions.\\nBy classifying natural language commands, our system allows users to invoke\\ncomplex software functionalities through simple inputs, improving interaction\\nefficiency and lowering the barrier to software utilization. Our dataset\\ngeneration approach also enables the efficient and systematic evaluation of\\ndifferent LLMs in classifying API calls, offering a practical tool for\\ndevelopers or business owners to assess the suitability of LLMs for customized\\nAPI management. We conduct experiments on several prominent LLMs using\\ngenerated sample datasets for various API functions. The results show that\\nGPT-4 achieves a high classification accuracy of 0.996, while LLaMA-3-8B\\nperforms much worse at 0.759. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to\\ntransform API management and validate the effectiveness of our system in\\nguiding model testing and selection across diverse applications.\\n\\nTitle: Hackphyr: A Local Fine-Tuned LLM Agent for Network Security Environments\\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11276v1\\nSummary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential across various\\ndomains, including cybersecurity. Using commercial cloud-based LLMs may be\\nundesirable due to privacy concerns, costs, and network connectivity\\nconstraints. In this paper, we present Hackphyr, a locally fine-tuned LLM to be\\nused as a red-team agent within network security environments. Our fine-tuned 7\\nbillion parameter model can run on a single GPU card and achieves performance\\ncomparable with much larger and more powerful commercial models such as GPT-4.\\nHackphyr clearly outperforms other models, including GPT-3.5-turbo, and\\nbaselines, such as Q-learning agents in complex, previously unseen scenarios.\\nTo achieve this performance, we generated a new task-specific cybersecurity\\ndataset to enhance the base model's capabilities. Finally, we conducted a\\ncomprehensive analysis of the agents' behaviors that provides insights into the\\nplanning abilities and potential shortcomings of such agents, contributing to\\nthe broader understanding of LLM-based agents in cybersecurity contexts\\n\\nTitle: Investigating Context-Faithfulness in Large Language Models: The Roles of Memory Strength and Evidence Style\\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10955v1\\nSummary: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves Large Language Models (LLMs) by\\nincorporating external information into the response generation process.\\nHowever, how context-faithful LLMs are and what factors influence LLMs'\\ncontext-faithfulness remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate\\nthe impact of memory strength and evidence presentation on LLMs' receptiveness\\nto external evidence. We introduce a method to quantify the memory strength of\\nLLMs by measuring the divergence in LLMs' responses to different paraphrases of\\nthe same question, which is not considered by previous works. We also generate\\nevidence in various styles to evaluate the effects of evidence in different\\nstyles. Two datasets are used for evaluation: Natural Questions (NQ) with\\npopular questions and popQA featuring long-tail questions. Our results show\\nthat for questions with high memory strength, LLMs are more likely to rely on\\ninternal memory, particularly for larger LLMs such as GPT-4. On the other hand,\\npresenting paraphrased evidence significantly increases LLMs' receptiveness\\ncompared to simple repetition or adding details.\\n\\nTitle: GPT takes the SAT: Tracing changes in Test Difficulty and Math Performance of Students\\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10750v1\\nSummary: Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is crucial for college admissions but its\\neffectiveness and relevance are increasingly questioned. This paper enhances\\nSynthetic Control methods by introducing \\\"Transformed Control\\\", a novel method\\nthat employs Large Language Models (LLMs) powered by Artificial Intelligence to\\ngenerate control groups. We utilize OpenAI's API to generate a control group\\nwhere GPT-4, or ChatGPT, takes multiple SATs annually from 2008 to 2023. This\\ncontrol group helps analyze shifts in SAT math difficulty over time, starting\\nfrom the baseline year of 2008. Using parallel trends, we calculate the Average\\nDifference in Scores (ADS) to assess changes in high school students' math\\nperformance. Our results indicate a significant decrease in the difficulty of\\nthe SAT math section over time, alongside a decline in students' math\\nperformance. The analysis shows a 71-point drop in the rigor of SAT math from\\n2008 to 2023, with student performance decreasing by 36 points, resulting in a\\n107-point total divergence in average student math performance. We investigate\\npossible mechanisms for this decline in math proficiency, such as changing\\nuniversity selection criteria, increased screen time, grade inflation, and\\nworsening adolescent mental health. Disparities among demographic groups show a\\n104-point drop for White students, 84 points for Black students, and 53 points\\nfor Asian students. Male students saw a 117-point reduction, while female\\nstudents had a 100-point decrease.\\n\\nTitle: LLMs for clinical risk prediction\\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10191v1\\nSummary: This study compares the efficacy of GPT-4 and clinalytix Medical AI in\\npredicting the clinical risk of delirium development.

How adept is\nmodern AI at these inferences? We introduce an evaluation framework for testing\naffective cognition in foundation models. Starting from psychological theory,\nwe generate 1,280 diverse scenarios exploring relationships between appraisals,\nemotions, expressions, and outcomes. We evaluate the abilities of foundation\nmodels (GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini-1.5-Pro) and humans (N = 567) across carefully\nselected conditions. Our results show foundation models tend to agree with\nhuman intuitions, matching or exceeding interparticipant agreement. In some\nconditions, models are ``superhuman'' -- they better predict modal human\njudgements than the average human. All models benefit from chain-of-thought\nreasoning. This suggests foundation models have acquired a human-like\nunderstanding of emotions and their influence on beliefs and behavior.\n\nTitle: From Lists to Emojis: How Format Bias Affects Model Alignment\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11704v1\nSummary: In this paper, we study format biases in reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF). We observe that many widely-used preference models, including\nhuman evaluators, GPT-4, and top-ranking models on the RewardBench benchmark,\nexhibit strong biases towards specific format patterns, such as lists, links,\nbold text, and emojis. Furthermore, large language models (LLMs) can exploit\nthese biases to achieve higher rankings on popular benchmarks like AlpacaEval\nand LMSYS Chatbot Arena. One notable example of this is verbosity bias, where\ncurrent preference models favor longer responses that appear more\ncomprehensive, even when their quality is equal to or lower than shorter,\ncompeting responses. However, format biases beyond verbosity remain largely\nunderexplored in the literature. In this work, we extend the study of biases in\npreference learning beyond the commonly recognized length bias, offering a\ncomprehensive analysis of a wider range of format biases. Additionally, we show\nthat with a small amount of biased data (less than 1%), we can inject\nsignificant bias into the reward model. Moreover, these format biases can also\nbe easily exploited by downstream alignment algorithms, such as best-of-n\nsampling and online iterative DPO, as it is usually easier to manipulate the\nformat than to improve the quality of responses. Our findings emphasize the\nneed to disentangle format and content both for designing alignment algorithms\nand evaluating models.\n\nTitle: Harnessing LLMs for API Interactions: A Framework for Classification and Synthetic Data Generation\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11703v1\nSummary: As Large Language Models (LLMs) advance in natural language processing, there\nis growing interest in leveraging their capabilities to simplify software\ninteractions. In this paper, we propose a novel system that integrates LLMs for\nboth classifying natural language inputs into corresponding API calls and\nautomating the creation of sample datasets tailored to specific API functions.\nBy classifying natural language commands, our system allows users to invoke\ncomplex software functionalities through simple inputs, improving interaction\nefficiency and lowering the barrier to software utilization. Our dataset\ngeneration approach also enables the efficient and systematic evaluation of\ndifferent LLMs in classifying API calls, offering a practical tool for\ndevelopers or business owners to assess the suitability of LLMs for customized\nAPI management. We conduct experiments on several prominent LLMs using\ngenerated sample datasets for various API functions. The results show that\nGPT-4 achieves a high classification accuracy of 0.996, while LLaMA-3-8B\nperforms much worse at 0.759. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to\ntransform API management and validate the effectiveness of our system in\nguiding model testing and selection across diverse applications.\n\nTitle: Hackphyr: A Local Fine-Tuned LLM Agent for Network Security Environments\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11276v1\nSummary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential across various\ndomains, including cybersecurity. Using commercial cloud-based LLMs may be\nundesirable due to privacy concerns, costs, and network connectivity\nconstraints. In this paper, we present Hackphyr, a locally fine-tuned LLM to be\nused as a red-team agent within network security environments. Our fine-tuned 7\nbillion parameter model can run on a single GPU card and achieves performance\ncomparable with much larger and more powerful commercial models such as GPT-4.\nHackphyr clearly outperforms other models, including GPT-3.5-turbo, and\nbaselines, such as Q-learning agents in complex, previously unseen scenarios.\nTo achieve this performance, we generated a new task-specific cybersecurity\ndataset to enhance the base model's capabilities. Finally, we conducted a\ncomprehensive analysis of the agents' behaviors that provides insights into the\nplanning abilities and potential shortcomings of such agents, contributing to\nthe broader understanding of LLM-based agents in cybersecurity contexts\n\nTitle: Investigating Context-Faithfulness in Large Language Models: The Roles of Memory Strength and Evidence Style\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10955v1\nSummary: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves Large Language Models (LLMs) by\nincorporating external information into the response generation process.\nHowever, how context-faithful LLMs are and what factors influence LLMs'\ncontext-faithfulness remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate\nthe impact of memory strength and evidence presentation on LLMs' receptiveness\nto external evidence. We introduce a method to quantify the memory strength of\nLLMs by measuring the divergence in LLMs' responses to different paraphrases of\nthe same question, which is not considered by previous works. We also generate\nevidence in various styles to evaluate the effects of evidence in different\nstyles. Two datasets are used for evaluation: Natural Questions (NQ) with\npopular questions and popQA featuring long-tail questions. Our results show\nthat for questions with high memory strength, LLMs are more likely to rely on\ninternal memory, particularly for larger LLMs such as GPT-4. On the other hand,\npresenting paraphrased evidence significantly increases LLMs' receptiveness\ncompared to simple repetition or adding details.\n\nTitle: GPT takes the SAT: Tracing changes in Test Difficulty and Math Performance of Students\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10750v1\nSummary: Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is crucial for college admissions but its\neffectiveness and relevance are increasingly questioned. This paper enhances\nSynthetic Control methods by introducing \"Transformed Control\", a novel method\nthat employs Large Language Models (LLMs) powered by Artificial Intelligence to\ngenerate control groups. We utilize OpenAI's API to generate a control group\nwhere GPT-4, or ChatGPT, takes multiple SATs annually from 2008 to 2023. This\ncontrol group helps analyze shifts in SAT math difficulty over time, starting\nfrom the baseline year of 2008. Using parallel trends, we calculate the Average\nDifference in Scores (ADS) to assess changes in high school students' math\nperformance. Our results indicate a significant decrease in the difficulty of\nthe SAT math section over time, alongside a decline in students' math\nperformance. The analysis shows a 71-point drop in the rigor of SAT math from\n2008 to 2023, with student performance decreasing by 36 points, resulting in a\n107-point total divergence in average student math performance. We investigate\npossible mechanisms for this decline in math proficiency, such as changing\nuniversity selection criteria, increased screen time, grade inflation, and\nworsening adolescent mental health. Disparities among demographic groups show a\n104-point drop for White students, 84 points for Black students, and 53 points\nfor Asian students. Male students saw a 117-point reduction, while female\nstudents had a 100-point decrease.\n\nTitle: LLMs for clinical risk prediction\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10191v1\nSummary: This study compares the efficacy of GPT-4 and clinalytix Medical AI in\npredicting the clinical risk of delirium development. Findings indicate that\nGPT-4 exhibited significant deficiencies in identifying positive cases and\nstruggled to provide reliable probability estimates for delirium risk, while\nclinalytix Medical AI demonstrated superior accuracy. A thorough analysis of\nthe large language model's (LLM) outputs elucidated potential causes for these\ndiscrepancies, consistent with limitations reported in extant literature. These\nresults underscore the challenges LLMs face in accurately diagnosing conditions\nand interpreting complex clinical data. While LLMs hold substantial potential\nin healthcare, they are currently unsuitable for independent clinical\ndecision-making. Instead, they should be employed in assistive roles,\ncomplementing clinical expertise. Continued human oversight remains essential\nto ensure optimal outcomes for both patients and healthcare providers.\n\nTitle: MindGuard: Towards Accessible and Sitgma-free Mental Health First Aid via Edge LLM\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10064v1\nSummary: Mental health disorders are among the most prevalent diseases worldwide,\naffecting nearly one in four people. Despite their widespread impact, the\nintervention rate remains below 25%, largely due to the significant cooperation\nrequired from patients for both diagnosis and intervention. The core issue\nbehind this low treatment rate is stigma, which discourages over half of those\naffected from seeking help. This paper presents MindGuard, an accessible,\nstigma-free, and professional mobile mental healthcare system designed to\nprovide mental health first aid. The heart of MindGuard is an innovative edge\nLLM, equipped with professional mental health knowledge, that seamlessly\nintegrates objective mobile sensor data with subjective Ecological Momentary\nAssessment records to deliver personalized screening and intervention\nconversations. We conduct a broad evaluation of MindGuard using open datasets\nspanning four years and real-world deployment across various mobile devices\ninvolving 20 subjects for two weeks. Remarkably, MindGuard achieves results\ncomparable to GPT-4 and outperforms its counterpart with more than 10 times the\nmodel size. We believe that MindGuard paves the way for mobile LLM\napplications, potentially revolutionizing mental healthcare practices by\nsubstituting self-reporting and intervention conversations with passive,\nintegrated monitoring within daily life, thus ensuring accessible and\nstigma-free mental health support.\n\nTitle: SelECT-SQL: Self-correcting ensemble Chain-of-Thought for Text-to-SQL\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10007v1\nSummary: In recent years,Text-to-SQL, the problem of automatically converting\nquestions posed in natural language to formal SQL queries, has emerged as an\nimportant problem at the intersection of natural language processing and data\nmanagement research. Large language models (LLMs) have delivered impressive\nperformance when used in an off-the-shelf performance, but still fall\nsignificantly short of expected expert-level performance. Errors are especially\nprobable when a nuanced understanding is needed of database schemas, questions,\nand SQL clauses to do proper Text-to-SQL conversion. We introduce SelECT-SQL, a\nnovel in-context learning solution that uses an algorithmic combination of\nchain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, self-correction, and ensemble methods to\nyield a new state-of-the-art result on challenging Text-to-SQL benchmarks.\nSpecifically, when configured using GPT-3.5-Turbo as the base LLM, SelECT-SQL\nachieves 84.2% execution accuracy on the Spider leaderboard's development set,\nexceeding both the best results of other baseline GPT-3.5-Turbo-based solutions\n(81.1%), and the peak performance (83.5%) of the GPT-4 result reported on the\nleaderboard.\n\nTitle: GP-GPT: Large Language Model for Gene-Phenotype Mapping\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09825v1\nSummary: Pre-trained large language models(LLMs) have attracted increasing attention\nin biomedical domains due to their success in natural language processing.\nHowever, the complex traits and heterogeneity of multi-sources genomics data\npose significant challenges when adapting these models to the bioinformatics\nand biomedical field. To address these challenges, we present GP-GPT, the first\nspecialized large language model for genetic-phenotype knowledge representation\nand genomics relation analysis. Our model is fine-tuned in two stages on a\ncomprehensive corpus composed of over 3,000,000 terms in genomics, proteomics,\nand medical genetics, derived from multiple large-scale validated datasets and\nscientific publications. GP-GPT demonstrates proficiency in accurately\nretrieving medical genetics information and performing common genomics analysis\ntasks, such as genomics information retrieval and relationship determination.\nComparative experiments across domain-specific tasks reveal that GP-GPT\noutperforms state-of-the-art LLMs, including Llama2, Llama3 and GPT-4. These\nresults highlight GP-GPT's potential to enhance genetic disease relation\nresearch and facilitate accurate and efficient analysis in the fields of\ngenomics and medical genetics. Our investigation demonstrated the subtle\nchanges of bio-factor entities' representations in the GP-GPT, which suggested\nthe opportunities for the application of LLMs to advancing gene-phenotype\nresearch.\n\n", "role": "user", "name": "User_proxy"}, {"content": "Read the above conversation.

How adept is\nmodern AI at these inferences? We introduce an evaluation framework for testing\naffective cognition in foundation models. Starting from psychological theory,\nwe generate 1,280 diverse scenarios exploring relationships between appraisals,\nemotions, expressions, and outcomes. We evaluate the abilities of foundation\nmodels (GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini-1.5-Pro) and humans (N = 567) across carefully\nselected conditions. Our results show foundation models tend to agree with\nhuman intuitions, matching or exceeding interparticipant agreement. In some\nconditions, models are ``superhuman'' -- they better predict modal human\njudgements than the average human. All models benefit from chain-of-thought\nreasoning. This suggests foundation models have acquired a human-like\nunderstanding of emotions and their influence on beliefs and behavior.\n\nTitle: From Lists to Emojis: How Format Bias Affects Model Alignment\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11704v1\nSummary: In this paper, we study format biases in reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF). We observe that many widely-used preference models, including\nhuman evaluators, GPT-4, and top-ranking models on the RewardBench benchmark,\nexhibit strong biases towards specific format patterns, such as lists, links,\nbold text, and emojis. Furthermore, large language models (LLMs) can exploit\nthese biases to achieve higher rankings on popular benchmarks like AlpacaEval\nand LMSYS Chatbot Arena. One notable example of this is verbosity bias, where\ncurrent preference models favor longer responses that appear more\ncomprehensive, even when their quality is equal to or lower than shorter,\ncompeting responses. However, format biases beyond verbosity remain largely\nunderexplored in the literature. In this work, we extend the study of biases in\npreference learning beyond the commonly recognized length bias, offering a\ncomprehensive analysis of a wider range of format biases. Additionally, we show\nthat with a small amount of biased data (less than 1%), we can inject\nsignificant bias into the reward model. Moreover, these format biases can also\nbe easily exploited by downstream alignment algorithms, such as best-of-n\nsampling and online iterative DPO, as it is usually easier to manipulate the\nformat than to improve the quality of responses. Our findings emphasize the\nneed to disentangle format and content both for designing alignment algorithms\nand evaluating models.\n\nTitle: Harnessing LLMs for API Interactions: A Framework for Classification and Synthetic Data Generation\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11703v1\nSummary: As Large Language Models (LLMs) advance in natural language processing, there\nis growing interest in leveraging their capabilities to simplify software\ninteractions. In this paper, we propose a novel system that integrates LLMs for\nboth classifying natural language inputs into corresponding API calls and\nautomating the creation of sample datasets tailored to specific API functions.\nBy classifying natural language commands, our system allows users to invoke\ncomplex software functionalities through simple inputs, improving interaction\nefficiency and lowering the barrier to software utilization. Our dataset\ngeneration approach also enables the efficient and systematic evaluation of\ndifferent LLMs in classifying API calls, offering a practical tool for\ndevelopers or business owners to assess the suitability of LLMs for customized\nAPI management. We conduct experiments on several prominent LLMs using\ngenerated sample datasets for various API functions. The results show that\nGPT-4 achieves a high classification accuracy of 0.996, while LLaMA-3-8B\nperforms much worse at 0.759. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to\ntransform API management and validate the effectiveness of our system in\nguiding model testing and selection across diverse applications.\n\nTitle: Hackphyr: A Local Fine-Tuned LLM Agent for Network Security Environments\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11276v1\nSummary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential across various\ndomains, including cybersecurity. Using commercial cloud-based LLMs may be\nundesirable due to privacy concerns, costs, and network connectivity\nconstraints. In this paper, we present Hackphyr, a locally fine-tuned LLM to be\nused as a red-team agent within network security environments. Our fine-tuned 7\nbillion parameter model can run on a single GPU card and achieves performance\ncomparable with much larger and more powerful commercial models such as GPT-4.\nHackphyr clearly outperforms other models, including GPT-3.5-turbo, and\nbaselines, such as Q-learning agents in complex, previously unseen scenarios.\nTo achieve this performance, we generated a new task-specific cybersecurity\ndataset to enhance the base model's capabilities. Finally, we conducted a\ncomprehensive analysis of the agents' behaviors that provides insights into the\nplanning abilities and potential shortcomings of such agents, contributing to\nthe broader understanding of LLM-based agents in cybersecurity contexts\n\nTitle: Investigating Context-Faithfulness in Large Language Models: The Roles of Memory Strength and Evidence Style\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10955v1\nSummary: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves Large Language Models (LLMs) by\nincorporating external information into the response generation process.\nHowever, how context-faithful LLMs are and what factors influence LLMs'\ncontext-faithfulness remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate\nthe impact of memory strength and evidence presentation on LLMs' receptiveness\nto external evidence. We introduce a method to quantify the memory strength of\nLLMs by measuring the divergence in LLMs' responses to different paraphrases of\nthe same question, which is not considered by previous works. We also generate\nevidence in various styles to evaluate the effects of evidence in different\nstyles. Two datasets are used for evaluation: Natural Questions (NQ) with\npopular questions and popQA featuring long-tail questions. Our results show\nthat for questions with high memory strength, LLMs are more likely to rely on\ninternal memory, particularly for larger LLMs such as GPT-4. On the other hand,\npresenting paraphrased evidence significantly increases LLMs' receptiveness\ncompared to simple repetition or adding details.\n\nTitle: GPT takes the SAT: Tracing changes in Test Difficulty and Math Performance of Students\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10750v1\nSummary: Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is crucial for college admissions but its\neffectiveness and relevance are increasingly questioned. This paper enhances\nSynthetic Control methods by introducing \"Transformed Control\", a novel method\nthat employs Large Language Models (LLMs) powered by Artificial Intelligence to\ngenerate control groups. We utilize OpenAI's API to generate a control group\nwhere GPT-4, or ChatGPT, takes multiple SATs annually from 2008 to 2023. This\ncontrol group helps analyze shifts in SAT math difficulty over time, starting\nfrom the baseline year of 2008. Using parallel trends, we calculate the Average\nDifference in Scores (ADS) to assess changes in high school students' math\nperformance. Our results indicate a significant decrease in the difficulty of\nthe SAT math section over time, alongside a decline in students' math\nperformance. The analysis shows a 71-point drop in the rigor of SAT math from\n2008 to 2023, with student performance decreasing by 36 points, resulting in a\n107-point total divergence in average student math performance. We investigate\npossible mechanisms for this decline in math proficiency, such as changing\nuniversity selection criteria, increased screen time, grade inflation, and\nworsening adolescent mental health. Disparities among demographic groups show a\n104-point drop for White students, 84 points for Black students, and 53 points\nfor Asian students. Male students saw a 117-point reduction, while female\nstudents had a 100-point decrease.\n\nTitle: LLMs for clinical risk prediction\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10191v1\nSummary: This study compares the efficacy of GPT-4 and clinalytix Medical AI in\npredicting the clinical risk of delirium development. Findings indicate that\nGPT-4 exhibited significant deficiencies in identifying positive cases and\nstruggled to provide reliable probability estimates for delirium risk, while\nclinalytix Medical AI demonstrated superior accuracy. A thorough analysis of\nthe large language model's (LLM) outputs elucidated potential causes for these\ndiscrepancies, consistent with limitations reported in extant literature. These\nresults underscore the challenges LLMs face in accurately diagnosing conditions\nand interpreting complex clinical data. While LLMs hold substantial potential\nin healthcare, they are currently unsuitable for independent clinical\ndecision-making. Instead, they should be employed in assistive roles,\ncomplementing clinical expertise. Continued human oversight remains essential\nto ensure optimal outcomes for both patients and healthcare providers.\n\nTitle: MindGuard: Towards Accessible and Sitgma-free Mental Health First Aid via Edge LLM\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10064v1\nSummary: Mental health disorders are among the most prevalent diseases worldwide,\naffecting nearly one in four people. Despite their widespread impact, the\nintervention rate remains below 25%, largely due to the significant cooperation\nrequired from patients for both diagnosis and intervention. The core issue\nbehind this low treatment rate is stigma, which discourages over half of those\naffected from seeking help. This paper presents MindGuard, an accessible,\nstigma-free, and professional mobile mental healthcare system designed to\nprovide mental health first aid. The heart of MindGuard is an innovative edge\nLLM, equipped with professional mental health knowledge, that seamlessly\nintegrates objective mobile sensor data with subjective Ecological Momentary\nAssessment records to deliver personalized screening and intervention\nconversations. We conduct a broad evaluation of MindGuard using open datasets\nspanning four years and real-world deployment across various mobile devices\ninvolving 20 subjects for two weeks. Remarkably, MindGuard achieves results\ncomparable to GPT-4 and outperforms its counterpart with more than 10 times the\nmodel size. We believe that MindGuard paves the way for mobile LLM\napplications, potentially revolutionizing mental healthcare practices by\nsubstituting self-reporting and intervention conversations with passive,\nintegrated monitoring within daily life, thus ensuring accessible and\nstigma-free mental health support.\n\nTitle: SelECT-SQL: Self-correcting ensemble Chain-of-Thought for Text-to-SQL\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10007v1\nSummary: In recent years,Text-to-SQL, the problem of automatically converting\nquestions posed in natural language to formal SQL queries, has emerged as an\nimportant problem at the intersection of natural language processing and data\nmanagement research. Large language models (LLMs) have delivered impressive\nperformance when used in an off-the-shelf performance, but still fall\nsignificantly short of expected expert-level performance. Errors are especially\nprobable when a nuanced understanding is needed of database schemas, questions,\nand SQL clauses to do proper Text-to-SQL conversion. We introduce SelECT-SQL, a\nnovel in-context learning solution that uses an algorithmic combination of\nchain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, self-correction, and ensemble methods to\nyield a new state-of-the-art result on challenging Text-to-SQL benchmarks.\nSpecifically, when configured using GPT-3.5-Turbo as the base LLM, SelECT-SQL\nachieves 84.2% execution accuracy on the Spider leaderboard's development set,\nexceeding both the best results of other baseline GPT-3.5-Turbo-based solutions\n(81.1%), and the peak performance (83.5%) of the GPT-4 result reported on the\nleaderboard.\n\nTitle: GP-GPT: Large Language Model for Gene-Phenotype Mapping\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09825v1\nSummary: Pre-trained large language models(LLMs) have attracted increasing attention\nin biomedical domains due to their success in natural language processing.\nHowever, the complex traits and heterogeneity of multi-sources genomics data\npose significant challenges when adapting these models to the bioinformatics\nand biomedical field. To address these challenges, we present GP-GPT, the first\nspecialized large language model for genetic-phenotype knowledge representation\nand genomics relation analysis. Our model is fine-tuned in two stages on a\ncomprehensive corpus composed of over 3,000,000 terms in genomics, proteomics,\nand medical genetics, derived from multiple large-scale validated datasets and\nscientific publications. GP-GPT demonstrates proficiency in accurately\nretrieving medical genetics information and performing common genomics analysis\ntasks, such as genomics information retrieval and relationship determination.\nComparative experiments across domain-specific tasks reveal that GP-GPT\noutperforms state-of-the-art LLMs, including Llama2, Llama3 and GPT-4. These\nresults highlight GP-GPT's potential to enhance genetic disease relation\nresearch and facilitate accurate and efficient analysis in the fields of\ngenomics and medical genetics. Our investigation demonstrated the subtle\nchanges of bio-factor entities' representations in the GP-GPT, which suggested\nthe opportunities for the application of LLMs to advancing gene-phenotype\nresearch.\n\n", "name": "User_proxy", "role": "user"}], "model": "qwen2.5-coder:7b-instruct-q8_0", "client_host": "http://192.168.0.115:11434"}, "response": "ChatCompletion(id='2024-09-21T00:21:05.667761177Z', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content=\"### Title: MindGuard: Towards Accessible and Stigma-free Mental Health First Aid via Edge LLM\\n\\n**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10064v1\\n\\n**Summary:** Mental health disorders are among the most prevalent diseases worldwide, affecting nearly one in four people.

Despite their widespread impact, intervention rates remain below 25%, largely due to significant patient cooperation required for both diagnosis and intervention. The primary issue is stigma, which discourages over half of those affected from seeking help. MindGuard aims to address these challenges by providing an accessible, stigma-free, and professional mobile mental healthcare system designed for mental health first aid. At its core, MindGuard uses an innovative edge LLM equipped with professional mental health knowledge to integrate objective sensor data with subjective assessments, offering personalized screening and intervention conversations.\\n\\n**Methodology:** The evaluation of MindGuard involved using open datasets spanning four years and real-world deployments across various mobile devices over two weeks with 20 subjects.
