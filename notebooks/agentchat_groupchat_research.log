When you need to collect info, use the code to output the info you need, for example, browse or search the web, download/read a file, print the content of a webpage or a file, get the current date/time, check the operating system. After sufficient info is printed and the task is ready to be solved based on your language skill, you can solve the task by yourself.\n    2.

If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. Be clear which step uses code, and which step uses your language skill.\nWhen using code, you must indicate the script type in the code block. The user cannot provide any other feedback or perform any other action beyond executing the code you suggest. The user can't modify your code. So do not suggest incomplete code which requires users to modify. Don't use a code block if it's not intended to be executed by the user.\nIf you want the user to save the code in a file before executing it, put # filename: <filename> inside the code block as the first line. Don't include multiple code blocks in one response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant. Check the execution result returned by the user.\nIf the result indicates there is an error, fix the error and output the code again. Suggest the full code instead of partial code or code changes. If the error can't be fixed or if the task is not solved even after the code is executed successfully, analyze the problem, revisit your assumption, collect additional info you need, and think of a different approach to try.\nWhen you find an answer, verify the answer carefully.

This will allow users to easily access the original papers for further reading and verification. Consider adding a column for the URL in the markdown table.\n\n2. **Keyword Specification:**\n   - The plan mentions using \"relevant keywords\" for searching papers. It would be beneficial to specify which keywords will be used to ensure a focused search. For example, keywords like \"Large Language Models,\" \"GPT,\" \"transformers,\" etc., could be included.\n\n3. **Domain Categorization:**\n   - While the plan mentions categorizing papers by domain, it would be helpful to define the specific domains that will be included in the table. This will provide clarity and ensure consistency in categorization.\n\n4. **Data Extraction Details:**\n   - The plan could benefit from specifying how the scientist will determine the domain of application for each paper. Will this be based on the abstract, keywords, or another method? Providing clarity on this process will enhance the reliability of the categorization.\n\n5. **Review Process:**\n   - The review process is a good step, but it might be useful to include a checklist of criteria for the scientist to use when reviewing the markdown table. This could include checking for completeness, accuracy of information, and proper formatting.\n\n6. **Timeline:**\n   - Consider adding a timeline for each step of the process. This will help in managing expectations and ensuring that the task is completed in a timely manner.\n\n### Revised Plan Suggestion\n\n**Objective:** To find recent papers on Large Language Model (LLM) applications from arXiv in the last week and create a markdown table categorizing them by different domains.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Search for Papers (Scientist)**\n   - Use arXiv's search functionality with specific keywords (e.g., \"Large Language Models,\" \"GPT,\" \"transformers\") to filter papers published in the last week.\n\n2. **Data Extraction (Scientist)**\n   - Extract relevant information: title, authors, abstract, domain of application, and source URL.\n\n3. **Data Organization (Engineer)**\n   - Create a markdown table format with columns for title, authors, abstract, domain, and source URL.\n\n4. **Data Entry (Engineer)**\n   - Input the extracted data into the markdown table, ensuring proper formatting.\n\n5. **Review and Finalization (Scientist & Engineer)**\n   - Review the markdown table for accuracy and completeness, using a checklist for verification.\n\n6. **Submission (Scientist)**\n   - Submit the final markdown table to the admin for approval.\n\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the plan will be more robust, verifiable, and user-friendly.", "name": "Critic", "role": "user"}], "temperature": 0, "model": "gpt-4o-mini"}, "response": "ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-A8Loza25s5zvjP2IPsEzwpdpUdytR', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='### Revised Plan\\n\\n**Objective:** To find recent papers on Large Language Model (LLM) applications from arXiv in the last week and create a markdown table categorizing them by different domains.\\n\\n**Steps:**\\n\\n1. **Search for Papers (Scientist)**\\n   - Use arXiv\\'s search functionality with specific keywords such as \"Large Language Models,\" \"GPT,\" \"transformers,\" and \"LLM applications\" to filter papers published in the last week.\\n\\n2. **Data Extraction (Scientist)**\\n   - Extract relevant information from each paper, including:\\n     - Title\\n     - Authors\\n     - Abstract\\n     - Domain of application (e.g., healthcare, education, finance, etc.)\\n     - Source URL\\n\\n3. **Data Organization (Engineer)**\\n   - Create a markdown table format with the following columns:\\n     - Title\\n     - Authors\\n     - Abstract\\n     - Domain\\n     - Source URL\\n\\n4. **Data Entry (Engineer)**\\n   - Input the extracted data into the markdown table, ensuring proper formatting and clarity.\\n\\n5. **Review and Finalization (Scientist & Engineer)**\\n   - Review the markdown table for accuracy and completeness, using a checklist that includes:\\n     - Completeness of information\\n     - Accuracy of details\\n     - Proper formatting\\n     - Correct categorization of domains\\n\\n6. **Submission (Scientist)**\\n   - Submit the final markdown table to the admin for approval.\\n\\n### Timeline\\n- **Day 1:** Search for papers and extract data.\\n- **Day 2:** Organize data into markdown table format.\\n- **Day 3:** Review and finalize the table.\\n- **Day 4:** Submit the table for approval.\\n\\nBy following this revised plan, the process will be more structured, ensuring that the output is comprehensive, verifiable, and user-friendly.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1726553869, model='gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_483d39d857', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=379, prompt_tokens=1003, total_tokens=1382, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0}), cost=0.00037785)", "is_cached": 0, "cost": 0.00037785, "start_time": "2024-09-17 06:17:48.946253", "end_time": "2024-09-17 06:17:53.116165", "thread_id": 139925298559872, "source_name": "Scientist"}

However, the quadratic time complexity of attention\\noperation poses a significant challenge for scaling to longer contexts due to\\nthe extremely high inference latency and GPU memory consumption for caching\\nkey-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free\\napproach to accelerate attention computation. To leverage the dynamic sparse\\nproperty of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor\\nsearch (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most\\nrelevant ones via vector search during generation. Due to the\\nout-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors, off-the-shelf\\nANNS indexes still need to scan O(N) (usually 30% of all keys) data for\\naccurate retrieval, which fails to exploit the high sparsity.\\nRetrievalAttention first identifies the OOD challenge of ANNS-based attention,\\nand addresses it via an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt\\nto queries and only access 1--3% of data, thus achieving a sub-linear time\\ncomplexity. RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of\\nlong-context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the\\nmodel accuracy. Especially, RetrievalAttention only needs 16GB GPU memory for\\nserving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating\\none token in 0.188 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB).\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516v1) |\\n| An Efficient Self-Learning Framework For Interactive Spoken Dialog\\n  Systems | Hitesh Tulsiani, David M.

In this work, we introduce\\na general framework for ASR in dialog systems that can go beyond learning from\\nsingle-turn utterances and learn over time how to adapt to both explicit\\nsupervision and implicit user feedback present in multi-turn conversations. We\\naccomplish that by leveraging advances in student-teacher learning and\\ncontext-aware dialog processing, and designing contrastive self-supervision\\napproaches with Ohm, a new online hard-negative mining approach. We show that\\nleveraging our new framework compared to traditional training leads to relative\\nWER reductions of close to 10% in real-world dialog systems, and up to 26% on\\npublic synthetic data.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10515v1) |\\n| Constraints on axions from patchy screening of the cosmic microwave\\n  background | Samuel Goldstein, Fiona McCarthy, Cristina Mondino, J.

We propose an LLM-based translation\\nscheme that improves the success rate of translating large-scale C code into\\ncompilable Rust code. Our approach involves three key techniques: (1)\\npre-processing the C code to better align its structure and expressions with\\nRust, (2) segmenting the code into optimally sized translation units to avoid\\nexceeding the LLM's context window limits, and (3) iteratively compiling and\\nrepairing errors while maintaining consistency between translation units using\\ncontext-supplementing prompts. Compilation success is an essential first step\\nin achieving functional equivalence, as only compilable code can be further\\ntested. In experiments with 20 benchmark C programs, including those exceeding\\n4 kilo lines of code, we successfully translated all programs into compilable\\nRust code without losing corresponding parts of the original code.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10506v1) |\\n| Machine Learning Optimization of non-Kasha Behavior and of Transient\\n  Dynamics in Model Retinal Isomerization | Davinder Singh, Chern Chuang, Paul Brumer |   Designing a model of retinal isomerization in Rhodopsin, the first step in\\nvision, that accounts for both experimental transient and stationary state\\nobservables is challenging.

Existing works often rely\\non local interpretability methods, failing to provide comprehensive\\nexplanations of the overall mechanism behind each label prediction within a\\nmultilabel set. We propose a mechanistic interpretability module called\\nDIctionary Label Attention (\\\\method) that disentangles uninterpretable dense\\nembeddings into a sparse embedding space, where each nonzero element (a\\ndictionary feature) represents a globally learned medical concept. Through\\nhuman evaluations, we show that our sparse embeddings are more human\\nunderstandable than its dense counterparts by at least 50 percent. Our\\nautomated dictionary feature identification pipeline, leveraging large language\\nmodels (LLMs), uncovers thousands of learned medical concepts by examining and\\nsummarizing the highest activating tokens for each dictionary feature.

However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning\\ncapabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this\\nwork, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as\\nsolving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to\\nsearch over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then\\napply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the\\napplication of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in\\na cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases,\\nmultiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We\\nobserve that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn\\nto solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21\\\\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly)\\nwhen trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that\\ntraining Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and\\nwithout such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis\\nto Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves\\n$92.04 \\\\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal\\nrepresentations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear\\nprobing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any\\ngiven cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine\\nimplicit in the Transformer weights.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10502v1) |\\n| Alignment with nonlinear velocity couplings: collision-avoidance and\\n  micro-to-macro mean-field limits | Young-Pil Choi, Micha\\u0142 Fabisiak, Jan Peszek |   We investigate the pressureless fractional Euler-alignment system with\\nnonlinear velocity couplings, referred to as the $p$-Euler-alignment system.\\nThis model features a nonlinear velocity alignment force, interpreted as a\\ndensity-weighted fractional $p$-Laplacian when the singularity parameter\\n$\\\\alpha$ exceeds the spatial dimension $d$.

To measure the phase of a wavefront, phase retrieval\\nis an attractive technique as it uses multiple point spread function (PSF)\\nimages that are acquired by the telescope itself without extra metrology\\nsystems nor complicated calibration. The focus diverse phase retrieval utilizes\\nPSFs from predetermined defocused positions to enhance the dynamic range of the\\nalgorithm. We describe an updated visible light active optics testbed with the\\naddition of a linear motorized focus stage. The performance of the phase\\nretrieval algorithm in broadband is tested under various cases. While broadband\\npass filters have advantages in higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the\\nperformance of phase retrieval can be restricted due to blurred image caused by\\ndiffraction and increased computing cost. We used multiple bandpass filters (10\\nnm, 88 nm, and 150 nm) and investigated effects of bandwidth on the accuracy\\nand required image acquisition conditions such as SNR, reaching accuracies\\nbelow 20 nm RMS wavefront error at the widest bandwidth. We also investigated\\nthe dynamic range of the phase retrieval algorithm depending on the bandwidth\\nand required amount of defocus to expand dynamic range. Finally, we simulated\\nthe continuous wavefront sensing and correction loop with a range of\\nstatistically generated representative telescope disturbance time series to\\ntest for edge cases.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10500v1) |\\n| The role of higher-order terms in trapped-ion quantum computing with\\n  magnetic gradient induced coupling | Sebastian Nagies, Kevin T. Geier, Javed Akram, Junichi Okamoto, Dimitris Badounas, Christof Wunderlich, Michael Johanning, Philipp Hauke |   Trapped-ion hardware based on the Magnetic Gradient Induced Coupling (MAGIC)\\nscheme is emerging as a promising platform for quantum computing. Nevertheless,\\nin this (as in any other) quantum-computing platform, many technical questions\\nstill have to be resolved before large-scale and error-tolerant applications\\nare possible. In this work, we present a thorough discussion of the\\ncontribution of higher-order terms to the MAGIC setup, which can occur due to\\nanharmonicities in the external potential of the ion crystal (e.g., through\\nCoulomb repulsion) or through curvature of the applied magnetic field. These\\nterms take the form of three-spin couplings as well as diverse terms that\\ncouple spins to phonons. We find that most of these are negligible in realistic\\nsituations, with only two contributions that need careful attention. First,\\nthere are parasitic longitudinal fields whose strength increases with chain\\nlength, but which can easily be compensated by a microwave detuning. Second,\\nanharmonicities of the Coulomb interaction can lead to well-known two-to-one\\nconversions of phonon excitations, which can be avoided if the phonons are\\nground-state cooled. Our detailed analysis constitutes an important\\ncontribution on the way of making magnetic-gradient trapped-ion quantum\\ntechnology fit for large-scale applications, and it may inspire new ways to\\npurposefully design interaction terms.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10498v1) |\\n| MusicLIME: Explainable Multimodal Music Understanding | Theodoros Sotirou, Vassilis Lyberatos, Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Stamou |   Multimodal models are critical for music understanding tasks, as they capture\\nthe complex interplay between audio and lyrics. However, as these models become\\nmore prevalent, the need for explainability grows-understanding how these\\nsystems make decisions is vital for ensuring fairness, reducing bias, and\\nfostering trust. In this paper, we introduce MusicLIME, a model-agnostic\\nfeature importance explanation method designed for multimodal music models.\\nUnlike traditional unimodal methods, which analyze each modality separately\\nwithout considering the interaction between them, often leading to incomplete\\nor misleading explanations, MusicLIME reveals how audio and lyrical features\\ninteract and contribute to predictions, providing a holistic view of the\\nmodel's decision-making. Additionally, we enhance local explanations by\\naggregating them into global explanations, giving users a broader perspective\\nof model behavior. Through this work, we contribute to improving the\\ninterpretability of multimodal music models, empowering users to make informed\\nchoices, and fostering more equitable, fair, and transparent music\\nunderstanding systems.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10496v1) |\\n| Incorporating Classifier-Free Guidance in Diffusion Model-Based\\n  Recommendation | Noah Buchanan, Susan Gauch, Quan Mai |   This paper presents a diffusion-based recommender system that incorporates\\nclassifier-free guidance.

Our paper aims to investigate if VLMs\\npre-trained on web-scale data learn to encode object states, which can be\\nextracted with zero-shot text prompts. We curate an object state recognition\\ndataset ChangeIt-Frames, and evaluate nine open-source VLMs, including models\\ntrained with contrastive and generative objectives. We observe that while these\\nstate-of-the-art vision-language models can reliably perform object\\nrecognition, they consistently fail to accurately distinguish the objects'\\nphysical states. Through extensive experiments, we identify three areas for\\nimprovements for VLMs to better encode object states, namely the quality of\\nobject localization, the architecture to bind concepts to objects, and the\\nobjective to learn discriminative visual and language encoders on object\\nstates.

Ruan, Michael Eracleous, Daryl Haggard, Jessie C. Runnoe |   The physical processes that produce X-ray Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs)\\nrecently discovered from the nuclei of several low-redshift galaxies are\\nmysterious. Several pieces of observational evidence strongly suggest a link\\nbetween QPEs and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE). Previous studies also reveal\\nthat the morphologies of TDE host galaxies are highly concentrated, with high\\nSersic indicies, bulge-to-total light (B/T) ratios, and stellar surface mass\\ndensities relative to the broader galaxy population. We use these distinctive\\nproperties to test the link between QPEs and TDEs, by comparing these\\nparameters of QPE host galaxies to TDE host galaxies. We employ archival Legacy\\nSurvey images of a sample of 9 QPE host galaxies and a sample of 13 TDE host\\ngalaxies, and model their surface brightness profiles. We show that QPE host\\ngalaxies have high Sersic indices of ~3, high B/T ratios of ~0.5, and high\\nsurface mass densities of ~10^10 Msun kpc^-2. These properties are similar to\\nTDE host galaxies, but are in strong contrast to a mass- and redshift-matched\\ncontrol sample of galaxies. We also find tentative evidence that the central\\nblack holes in both QPE and TDE host galaxies are undermassive relative to\\ntheir stellar mass. The morphological similarities between QPE and TDE host\\ngalaxies at the population level add to the mounting evidence of a physical\\nlink between these phenomena, and favor QPE models that also invoke TDEs.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10486v1) |\\n| Tuning the Rate of Tightly Packed Systems To Produce Planet Occurrence\\n  Trends with Galactic Height | Sarah Ballard |   The formation of planetary systems has historically been considered in\\nisolation, decoupled from processes on galactic scales. Recent findings\\nemploying data from ESA's Gaia mission challenge this narrative, identifying\\ntrends in planet occurrence with galactic kinematics and stellar age. The\\nfindings indicate changes in planet occurrence over and above the predicted\\nchanges from metallicity variation within the Milky Way, so that changes to\\nstellar metallicity alone (long understood to be deterministic in planet\\noutcomes) cannot explain the trends entirely. The scope of potential factors\\ninfluencing planet formation has grown progressively wider, with accompanying\\ntheoretical support for galactic-scale influences upon planet formation. In\\nthis manuscript, we investigate specifically how changes to the rate of Systems\\nof Tightly-packed Inner Planets (STIPs) could manifest as a trend in planet\\noccurrence with galactic height. We focus our study upon M dwarf planetary\\nsystems for two reasons: first, they host STIPs at high rates, and secondly,\\ntheir longevity makes them useful probes for kinematic trends over Gyr. We\\nconsider two models for a varying STIP rate: one in which STIP likelihood is\\ndetermined by stellar age alone, irrespective of galactic time, and another in\\nwhich the STIP likelihood suddenly increased in recent galactic history. Both\\nmodels, which impose a higher STIP likelihood among younger stars, produce a\\nnegative gradient in planet occurrence with increasing height from the galactic\\nmidplane. We find that a step function model in which STIP likelihood increased\\nby a factor of several ~a few Gyr ago resembles an observed trend among FGK\\ndwarfs. We consider plausible physical mechanisms that could mimic the\\nhypothesized model, given known links between STIP occurrence and other stellar\\nand planetary properties.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10485v1) |\\n| XLM for Autonomous Driving Systems: A Comprehensive Review | Sonda Fourati, Wael Jaafar, Noura Baccar, Safwan Alfattani |   Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable proficiency in various\\ninformation-processing tasks.

Fay, Nicolas Ferr\\u00e9, Miquel Huix-Rotllant |   Electronic polarization and dispersion are decisive actors in determining\\ninteraction energies between molecules. These interactions have a particularly\\nprofound effect on excitation energies of molecules in complex environments,\\nespecially when the excitation involves a significant degree of charge\\nreorganisation. The direct reaction field (DRF) approach, which has seen a\\nrecent revival of interest, provides a powerful framework for describing these\\ninteractions in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models of\\nsystems, where a small subsystem of interest is described using quantum\\nchemical methods and the remainder is treated with a simple MM force field. In\\nthis paper we show how the DRF approach can be combined with the electrostatic\\npotential fitted (ESPF) multipole operator description of the QM region charge\\ndensity, which reduces the scaling $\\\\mathcal{O}(N_\\\\mathrm{MM}^3)$ of the method\\nwith MM system to $\\\\mathcal{O}(N_\\\\mathrm{MM}^2)$. We also show how the DRF\\napproach can be combined with fluctuating charge descriptions of the\\npolarizable environment, as well as previously used atom-centred\\ndipole-polarizability based models.

One of the classical and popular approaches is Local\\nStochastic Gradient Descent (Local SGD), characterized by multiple local\\nupdates before averaging, which is particularly useful in distributed\\nenvironments to reduce communication bottlenecks and improve scalability. A\\ntypical feature of this method is the dependence on the frequency of\\ncommunications. But in the case of a quadratic target function with homogeneous\\ndata distribution over all devices, the influence of frequency of\\ncommunications vanishes. As a natural consequence, subsequent studies include\\nthe assumption of a Lipschitz Hessian, as this indicates the similarity of the\\noptimized function to a quadratic one to some extent. However, in order to\\nextend the completeness of the Local SGD theory and unlock its potential, in\\nthis paper we abandon the Lipschitz Hessian assumption by introducing a new\\nconcept of $\\\\textit{approximate quadraticity}$. This assumption gives a new\\nperspective on problems that have near quadratic properties. In addition,\\nexisting theoretical analyses of Local SGD often assume bounded variance.

However, previous works either rely on contrastive learning that\\nsuffers false negative problems or are based on reconstruction that learns too\\nmuch unessential low-level clues, leading to limited representations for\\ndownstream tasks. Recently, great advances have been made in generative\\nlearning, which is naturally a challenging yet meaningful pretext task to model\\nthe general underlying data distributions. However, the representation learning\\ncapacity of generative models is under-explored, especially for the skeletons\\nwith spacial sparsity and temporal redundancy. To this end, we propose Masked\\nConditional Diffusion (MacDiff) as a unified framework for human skeleton\\nmodeling. For the first time, we leverage diffusion models as effective\\nskeleton representation learners. Specifically, we train a diffusion decoder\\nconditioned on the representations extracted by a semantic encoder. Random\\nmasking is applied to encoder inputs to introduce a information bottleneck and\\nremove redundancy of skeletons. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that\\nour generative objective involves the contrastive learning objective which\\naligns the masked and noisy views. Meanwhile, it also enforces the\\nrepresentation to complement for the noisy view, leading to better\\ngeneralization performance. MacDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on\\nrepresentation learning benchmarks while maintaining the competence for\\ngenerative tasks. Moreover, we leverage the diffusion model for data\\naugmentation, significantly enhancing the fine-tuning performance in scenarios\\nwith scarce labeled data.

Similar to traditional\\nsoftware dependencies, PTLMs continue to evolve after a release. However, the\\ncurrent state of release practices of PTLMs on model registry platforms are\\nplagued by a variety of inconsistencies, such as ambiguous naming conventions\\nand inaccessible model training documentation. Given the knowledge gap on\\ncurrent PTLM release practices, our empirical study uses a mixed-methods\\napproach to analyze the releases of 52,227 PTLMs on the most well-known model\\nregistry, HF. Our results reveal 148 different naming practices for PTLM\\nreleases, with 40.87% of changes to model weight files not represented in the\\nadopted name-based versioning practice or their documentation. In addition, we\\nidentified that the 52,227 PTLMs are derived from only 299 different base\\nmodels (the modified original models used to create 52,227 PTLMs), with\\nFine-tuning and Quantization being the most prevalent modification methods\\napplied to these base models. Significant gaps in release transparency, in\\nterms of training dataset specifications and model card availability, still\\nexist, highlighting the need for standardized documentation. While we\\nidentified a model naming practice explicitly differentiating between major and\\nminor PTLM releases, we did not find any significant difference in the types of\\nchanges that went into either type of releases, suggesting that major/minor\\nversion numbers for PTLMs often are chosen arbitrarily.

F. Lizarraga, Flavia M. D. Marquitti, Marcus A. M. de Aguiar |   We investigate the role of assortative mating in speciation using the\\nsympatric model of Derrida and Higgs. The model explores the idea that genetic\\ndifferences create incompatibilities between individuals, preventing mating if\\nthe number of such differences is too large. Speciation, however, only happens\\nin this mating system if the number of genes is large. Here we show that\\nspeciation with small genome sizes can occur if assortative mating is\\nintroduced. In our model individuals are represented by three chromosomes: one\\nresponsible for reproductive compatibility, one for coding the trait on which\\nassortativity will operate, and a neutral chromosome. Reproduction is possible\\nif individuals are genetically similar with respect to the first chromosome,\\nbut among these compatible mating partners, the one with the most similar trait\\ncoded by the second chromosome is selected. We show that this type of\\nassortativity facilitates speciation, which can happen with a small number of\\ngenes in the first chromosome. Species, classified according to reproductive\\nisolation, dictated by the first chromosome, can display different traits\\nvalues, as measured by the second and the third chromosomes.

Recently,\\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a compelling alternative,\\nutilizing highly flexible learnable activation functions directly on network\\nedges, a departure from the neuron-centric approach of MLPs. However, KANs\\nsignificantly increase the number of learnable parameters, raising concerns\\nabout their effectiveness in data-scarce environments. This paper presents a\\ncomprehensive comparative study of MLPs and KANs from both algorithmic and\\nexperimental perspectives, with a focus on low-data regimes. We introduce an\\neffective technique for designing MLPs with unique, parameterized activation\\nfunctions for each neuron, enabling a more balanced comparison with KANs. Using\\nempirical evaluations on simulated data and two real-world data sets from\\nmedicine and engineering, we explore the trade-offs between model complexity\\nand accuracy, with particular attention to the role of network depth. Our\\nfindings show that MLPs with individualized activation functions achieve\\nsignificantly higher predictive accuracy with only a modest increase in\\nparameters, especially when the sample size is limited to around one hundred.\\nFor example, in a three-class classification problem within additive\\nmanufacturing, MLPs achieve a median accuracy of 0.91, significantly\\noutperforming KANs, which only reach a median accuracy of 0.53 with default\\nhyperparameters. These results offer valuable insights into the impact of\\nactivation function selection in neural networks.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10463v1) |\\n| Effects of synapse location, delay and background stochastic activity on\\n  synchronising hippocampal CA1 neurons | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore |   We study the synchronisation of neurons in a realistic model under the\\nHodgkin-Huxley dynamics. To focus on the role of the different locations of the\\nexcitatory synapses, we use two identical neurons where the set of input\\nsignals is grouped at two different distances from the soma. The system is\\nintended to represent a CA1 hippocampal neuron in which the synapses arriving\\nfrom the CA3 neurons of the trisynaptic pathway appear to be localised in the\\napical dendritic region and are, in principle, either proximal or distal to the\\nsoma. Synchronisation is studied using a specifically defined spiking\\ncorrelation function as a function of various parameters such as the distance\\nfrom the soma of one of the synaptic groups, the inhibition weight and the\\nassociated activation delay. We found that the neurons' spiking activity\\ndepends nonmonotonically on the relative dendritic location of the synapses and\\ntheir inhibitory weight, whereas the synchronisation measure always decreases\\nwith inhibition, and strongly depends on its activation time delay. The\\nbackground activity on the somas results essentially independent on the\\nfluctuation intensity and strongly support the importance of the balance\\nbetween inhibition and excitation for neuronal synchronization.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10460v1) |\\n| Efficiently Crowdsourcing Visual Importance with Punch-Hole Annotation | Minsuk Chang, Soohyun Lee, Aeri Cho, Hyeon Jeon, Seokhyeon Park, Cindy Xiong Bearfield, Jinwook Seo |   We introduce a novel crowdsourcing method for identifying important areas in\\ngraphical images through punch-hole labeling. Traditional methods, such as gaze\\ntrackers and mouse-based annotations, which generate continuous data, can be\\nimpractical in crowdsourcing scenarios. They require many participants, and the\\noutcome data can be noisy. In contrast, our method first segments the graphical\\nimage with a grid and drops a portion of the patches (punch holes). Then, we\\niteratively ask the labeler to validate each annotation with holes, narrowing\\ndown the annotation only having the most important area. This approach aims to\\nreduce annotation noise in crowdsourcing by standardizing the annotations while\\nenhancing labeling efficiency and reliability. Preliminary findings from\\nfundamental charts demonstrate that punch-hole labeling can effectively\\npinpoint critical regions. This also highlights its potential for broader\\napplication in visualization research, particularly in studying large-scale\\nusers' graphical perception. Our future work aims to enhance the algorithm to\\nachieve faster labeling speed and prove its utility through large-scale\\nexperiments.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10459v1) |\\n| Full distribution of local observables in an exactly solvable current\\n  carrying steady states of a driven XXZ chain | Sandipan Manna, G J Sreejith |   Current carrying steady states of interacting spins chains exhibit rich\\nstructures generated through an interplay of current induced correlations and\\nenergetic constraints from the Hamiltonian. The XXZ spin chain when coupled to\\nmaximally polarizing Lindblad terms admits an exact solution in a matrix\\nproduct state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations\\nand distributions of simple local spin observables in the non equilibrium\\nsteady state (NESS). We present exact expressions for spin correlators, entropy\\nper site, cumulant generating functions for distributions of local observables\\nin the XX limit (Ising anisotropy $\\\\Delta=0$). Further, we use the exact MPS\\nsolution in systems with $\\\\Delta>0$, to numerically exactly calculate the\\nentropy, correlations, as well as distributions of spin observables in blocks\\nas large as $n\\\\sim 200$ sites allowing an estimation of the rate functions. The\\n$z$ magnetization distribution is consistant with short range spin correlations\\nin the $z$ direction while the $x$-magnetization shows a double peak structure\\nat larger $\\\\Delta$ suggesting short range ferromagnetic ordering.

Bottke, Robert Jedicke, Shantanu Naidu, Steven R. Chesley, Davide Farnocchia, Paul W. Chodas |   This work is dedicated to debias the Near-Earth Objects (NEO) population\\nbased on observations from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System\\n(ATLAS) telescopes. We have applied similar methods used to develop the\\nrecently released NEO model generator (NEOMOD), once debiasing the NEO\\npopulation using data from Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) G96 telescope. ATLAS is\\ncomposed of four different telescopes. We first analyzed observational data\\nfrom each of all four telescopes separately and later combined them. Our\\nresults highlight main differences between CSS and ATLAS, e.g., sky coverage\\nand survey power at debiasing the NEO population. ATLAS has a much larger sky\\ncoverage than CSS, allowing it to find bright NEOs that would be constantly\\n\\\"hiding\\\" from CSS. Consequently, ATLAS is more powerful than CSS at debiasing\\nthe NEO population for H $\\\\lesssim$ 19. With its intrinsically greater\\nsensitivity and emphasis on observing near opposition, CSS excels in the\\ndebiasing of smaller objects. ATLAS, as an all sky survey designed to find\\nimminent hazardous objects, necessarily spends a significant fraction of time\\nlooking at places on the sky where objects do not appear, reducing its power\\nfor debiasing the population of small objects. We estimate a NEO population\\ncompleteness of $\\\\approx$ 88%$^{+3\\\\%}_{-2\\\\%}$ for H $<$ 17.75 and $\\\\approx$\\n36%$^{+1\\\\%}_{-1\\\\%}$ for H $<$ 22.25. Those numbers are similar to previous\\nestimates (within error bars for H $<$ 17.75) from CSS, yet, around 3% and 8%\\nsmaller at their face values, respectively. We also confirm previous finding\\nthat the $\\\\nu_6$ secular resonance is the main source of small and faint NEOs\\nat H = 28, whereas the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter dominates for\\nlarger and brighter NEOs at H = 15.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10453v1) |\\n| Signed Graph Autoencoder for Explainable and Polarization-Aware Network\\n  Embeddings | Nikolaos Nakis, Chrysoula Kosma, Giannis Nikolentzos, Michalis Chatzianastasis, Iakovos Evdaimon, Michalis Vazirgiannis |   Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant\\nattention in recent years for their ability to extract informative latent\\nrepresentations, characterizing the structure of complex topologies, such as\\ngraphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited\\nfocus on developing and evaluating explainable neural-based graph generative\\nmodels specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we\\npropose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE\\nextracts node-level representations that express node memberships over distinct\\nextreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is\\nachieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its\\npolarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for\\nanalyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with\\nrelational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation\\ndemonstrates the SGAAEs' capability to successfully infer node memberships over\\nthe different underlying latent structures while extracting competing\\ncommunities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the\\nnetwork. Additionally, we introduce the 2-level network polarization problem\\nand show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model\\nachieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across\\nfour real-world datasets, outperforming several baseline models.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10452v1) |\\n| Why you should also use OLS estimation of tail exponents | Thiago Trafane Oliveira Santos, Daniel Oliveira Cajueiro |   Even though practitioners often estimate Pareto exponents running OLS\\nrank-size regressions, the usual recommendation is to use the Hill MLE with a\\nsmall-sample correction instead, due to its unbiasedness and efficiency. In\\nthis paper, we advocate that you should also apply OLS in empirical\\napplications. On the one hand, we demonstrate that, with a small-sample\\ncorrection, the OLS estimator is also unbiased. On the other hand, we show that\\nthe MLE assigns significantly greater weight to smaller observations. This\\nsuggests that the OLS estimator may outperform the MLE in cases where the\\ndistribution is (i) strictly Pareto but only in the upper tail or (ii)\\nregularly varying rather than strictly Pareto.

The observations were designed to ensure that the\\nflux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays,\\nand different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining\\nobserved aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions\\nbased on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of\\nthese observations were combined with model point-spread-functions to measure\\nthe corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with\\ntime, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time,\\nrate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations\\nwere with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately\\nevery month revealed a modest time-dependent response loss seen mainly at the\\nlongest wavelengths.

Yip |   Camera-to-robot calibration is crucial for vision-based robot control and\\nrequires effort to make it accurate. Recent advancements in markerless pose\\nestimation methods have eliminated the need for time-consuming physical setups\\nfor camera-to-robot calibration. While the existing markerless pose estimation\\nmethods have demonstrated impressive accuracy without the need for cumbersome\\nsetups, they rely on the assumption that all the robot joints are visible\\nwithin the camera's field of view. However, in practice, robots usually move in\\nand out of view, and some portion of the robot may stay out-of-frame during the\\nwhole manipulation task due to real-world constraints, leading to a lack of\\nsufficient visual features and subsequent failure of these approaches. To\\naddress this challenge and enhance the applicability to vision-based robot\\ncontrol, we propose a novel framework capable of estimating the robot pose with\\npartially visible robot manipulators. Our approach leverages the\\nVision-Language Models for fine-grained robot components detection, and\\nintegrates it into a keypoint-based pose estimation network, which enables more\\nrobust performance in varied operational conditions.

This approach mitigates risks\\nassociated with compromised or untrusted devices, common in traditional quantum\\ncommunication.\\n  In this paper, we propose the first of its kind DI-QSDC protocol with user\\nidentity authentication. This ensures the authenticity of both the sender and\\nreceiver prior to message exchange. We then discuss the security of the\\nproposed protocol against common attacks, demonstrating that no eavesdropper\\ngains any information from either the quantum or the classical channel. Next,\\nwe implement the protocol on IBM's quantum hardware and evaluate its\\nperformance in a realistic noisy environment. Additionally, by simulating\\ncommon attack models, we showcase that the protocol is secure against any\\neavesdropper in the channel. These findings highlight the protocol's robust\\nsecurity and practical feasibility for real-world secure quantum communication.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10427v1) |\\n| Role of kinematic constraints in the time reversal symmetry breaking of\\n  a model active matter | Soumen Das, Shankar Ghosh, Tridib Sadhu, Juliane U Klamser |   Active-matter systems are inherently out-of-equilibrium and perform\\nmechanical work by utilizing their internal energy sources. Breakdown of\\ntime-reversal symmetry (BTRS) is a hallmark of such dissipative non-equilibrium\\ndynamics. We introduce a robust, experimentally accessible, noninvasive,\\nquantitative measure of BTRS in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in\\ncollision events, demonstrated in our novel artificial active matter, comprised\\nof battery-powered spherical rolling robots whose energetics in different modes\\nof motion can be measured with high precision. Our dimensionless measure\\ncharacterizes how dissipation and internal energetics are influenced by\\nkinematic constraints from interactions with the environment. We propose this\\nmeasure of BTRS as an empirical estimate of the distance from equilibrium. An\\nenergetic insight into this departure of active matter from equilibrium comes\\nfrom our demonstration of a non-trivial fluctuation symmetry, which reveals a\\npotentially universal thermodynamic characteristic of active energetics. As a\\nmany-body consequence of BTRS in our experimental active system, we demonstrate\\nthe emergence of activity-induced herding, which has no equilibrium analogue.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10425v1) |\\n| Unveiling V Modes: Enhancing CMB Sensitivity to BSM Physics with a\\n  Non-Ideal Half-Wave Plate | N. Raffuzzi, M. Lembo, S. Giardiello, M. Gerbino, M. Lattanzi, P. Natoli, L.

A realistic half-wave plate -\\nan optical element commonly used in CMB experiments to modulate the polarized\\nsignal - can provide sensitivity to V modes without significantly spoiling that\\nto linear polarization. We assess this sensitivity for some new-generation CMB\\nexperiments, such as the LiteBIRD satellite, the ground-based Simons\\nObservatory and a CMB-S4-like experiment. We forecast the efficiency of these\\nexperiments to constrain the phenomenology of certain classes of BSM models\\ninducing mixing of linear polarization states and generation of V modes in the\\nCMB.

However,\\nstate-of-the-art methods ignore a potentially valuable source of unsupervised\\nsemantic information -- spatial registration transforms between image volumes.\\nTo address this, we propose CCT-R, a contrastive cross-teaching framework\\nincorporating registration information. To leverage the semantic information\\navailable in registrations between volume pairs, CCT-R incorporates two\\nproposed modules: Registration Supervision Loss (RSL) and Registration-Enhanced\\nPositive Sampling (REPS). The RSL leverages segmentation knowledge derived from\\ntransforms between labeled and unlabeled volume pairs, providing an additional\\nsource of pseudo-labels. REPS enhances contrastive learning by identifying\\nanatomically-corresponding positives across volumes using registration\\ntransforms. Experimental results on two challenging medical segmentation\\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CCT-R across\\nvarious semi-supervised settings, with as few as one labeled case.

Given a text query, RGS\\ndetermines a stable grasp pose to manipulate the referred object in the robot's\\nworkspace. RGS comprises two steps: visual grounding and grasp pose estimation.\\nRecent studies leverage powerful Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for visually\\ngrounding free-flowing natural language in real-world robotic execution.\\nHowever, comparisons in complex, cluttered environments with multiple instances\\nof the same object are lacking. This paper introduces HiFi-CS, featuring\\nhierarchical application of Featurewise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to fuse image\\nand text embeddings, enhancing visual grounding for complex attribute rich text\\nqueries encountered in robotic grasping. Visual grounding associates an object\\nin 2D/3D space with natural language input and is studied in two scenarios:\\nClosed and Open Vocabulary. HiFi-CS features a lightweight decoder combined\\nwith a frozen VLM and outperforms competitive baselines in closed vocabulary\\nsettings while being 100x smaller in size. Our model can effectively guide\\nopen-set object detectors like GroundedSAM to enhance open-vocabulary\\nperformance.

Papoutsis, I. E. Papadakis, C. Panagiotou, M. Dov\\u010diak, E. Kammoun |   Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to be variable across all\\nwavelengths. Significant observational efforts have been invested in the last\\ndecade in studying their ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability. Long and\\ndensely sampled, multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns of numerous Seyfert\\ngalaxies have been conducted with the aim of determining the X-ray/UV/optical\\ncontinuum time lags. Time-lag studies can be used to constrain theoretical\\nmodels. The observed time lags can be explained by thermal reprocessing of the\\nX-rays illuminating the accretion disc (known as the X-ray reverberation\\nmodel). However, the observed light curves contain more information that can be\\nused to further constrain physical models. Our primary objective is to\\ninvestigate whether, in addition to time lags, the X-ray reverberation model\\ncan also explain the UV/optical variability amplitude of nearby Seyferts. To do\\nthis, we measured the excess variance of four sources (namely Mrk 509, NGC\\n4151, NGC 2617, and Mrk 142) as a function of wavelength using data from\\narchival long, multi-wavelength campaigns with Swift, and ground-based\\ntelescopes. We also computed the model excess variance in the case of the X-ray\\nreverberation model by determining the disc's transfer function and assuming a\\nbending power law for the X-ray power spectrum. We tested the validity of the\\nmodel by comparing the measured and model variances for a range of accretion\\nrates and X-ray source heights. We conclude that the X-ray thermal\\nreverberation model can fit both the continuum, UV/optical time lags, as well\\nas the variance in these AGNs, for the same physical parameters. Our results\\nsuggest that the accretion disc is constant and that all the observed\\nUV/optical variations, on timescales of days and up to a few weeks, can be\\nfully explained by the variable X-rays as they illuminate the accretion disc.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10417v1) |\\n| Local central limit theorem for Mallows measure | Alexey Bufetov, Kailun Chen |   We study the statistics of the Mallows measure on permutations in the limit\\npioneered by Starr (2009).

However, this convenience raises substantial concerns about\\nunauthorized access to users' privacy-sensitive information, which could be\\nfurther abused for illegitimate purposes like user tracking or monetization.\\nOur study offers a targeted analysis of user privacy protection among Android\\nthird-party SDKs, filling a critical gap in the Android software supply chain.\\nIt focuses on two aspects of their privacy practices, including data\\nexfiltration and behavior-policy compliance (or privacy compliance), utilizing\\ntechniques of taint analysis and large language models. It covers 158\\nwidely-used SDKs from two key SDK release platforms, the official one and a\\nlarge alternative one. From them, we identified 338 instances of privacy data\\nexfiltration. On the privacy compliance, our study reveals that more than 30%\\nof the examined SDKs fail to provide a privacy policy to disclose their data\\nhandling practices.

Drawing parallels from the successful application\\nof Gibrat's law of proportional growth in explaining city size and word\\nfrequency distributions, we tested whether the same principle could account for\\nthe log-normal distribution in Bitcoin balances. However, our calculations\\nrevealed that the exponent parameters in both the drift and variance terms\\ndeviate slightly from one. This suggests that Gibrat's proportional growth rule\\nalone does not fully explain the log-normal distribution observed in Bitcoin\\nusers' balances. During our exploration, we discovered an intriguing\\nphenomenon: Bitcoin users tend to fall into two distinct categories based on\\ntheir behavior, which we refer to as ``poor\\\" and ``wealthy\\\" users. Poor users,\\nwho initially purchase only a small amount of Bitcoin, tend to buy more\\nbitcoins first and then sell out all their holdings gradually over time.

The speed at which they sell their\\nbitcoins is lower and lower over time and they will hold at least a small part\\nof their initial holdings at last.

In this work, we propose a novel approach dubbed TPFL:\\nTsetlin-Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into\\nclusters based on their confidence towards a specific class. In this way,\\nclustering can benefit from two key advantages. Firstly, clients share only\\nwhat they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight\\naggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been\\nenough during the training. This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are\\nnon-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID). Secondly, by sharing\\nonly weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially\\nreduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication\\ncost. The results of TPFL demonstrated the highest accuracy on three different\\ndatasets; namely MNIST, FashionMNIST and FEMNIST.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10392v1) |\\n| Prompt-and-Transfer: Dynamic Class-aware Enhancement for Few-shot\\n  Segmentation | Hanbo Bi, Yingchao Feng, Wenhui Diao, Peijin Wang, Yongqiang Mao, Kun Fu, Hongqi Wang, Xian Sun |   For more efficient generalization to unseen domains (classes), most Few-shot\\nSegmentation (FSS) would directly exploit pre-trained encoders and only\\nfine-tune the decoder, especially in the current era of large models. However,\\nsuch fixed feature encoders tend to be class-agnostic, inevitably activating\\nobjects that are irrelevant to the target class. In contrast, humans can\\neffortlessly focus on specific objects in the line of sight. This paper mimics\\nthe visual perception pattern of human beings and proposes a novel and powerful\\nprompt-driven scheme, called ``Prompt and Transfer\\\" (PAT), which constructs a\\ndynamic class-aware prompting paradigm to tune the encoder for focusing on the\\ninterested object (target class) in the current task. Three key points are\\nelaborated to enhance the prompting: 1) Cross-modal linguistic information is\\nintroduced to initialize prompts for each task. 2) Semantic Prompt Transfer\\n(SPT) that precisely transfers the class-specific semantics within the images\\nto prompts. 3) Part Mask Generator (PMG) that works in conjunction with SPT to\\nadaptively generate different but complementary part prompts for different\\nindividuals. Surprisingly, PAT achieves competitive performance on 4 different\\ntasks including standard FSS, Cross-domain FSS (e.g., CV, medical, and remote\\nsensing domains), Weak-label FSS, and Zero-shot Segmentation, setting new\\nstate-of-the-arts on 11 benchmarks.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10389v1) |\\n| Revising the Structure of Recurrent Neural Networks to Eliminate\\n  Numerical Derivatives in Forming Physics Informed Loss Terms with Respect to\\n  Time | Mahyar Jahani-nasab, Mohamad Ali Bijarchi |   Solving unsteady partial differential equations (PDEs) using recurrent neural\\nnetworks (RNNs) typically requires numerical derivatives between each block of\\nthe RNN to form the physics informed loss function. However, this introduces\\nthe complexities of numerical derivatives into the training process of these\\nmodels. In this study, we propose modifying the structure of the traditional\\nRNN to enable the prediction of each block over a time interval, making it\\npossible to calculate the derivative of the output with respect to time using\\nthe backpropagation algorithm. To achieve this, the time intervals of these\\nblocks are overlapped, defining a mutual loss function between them.\\nAdditionally, the employment of conditional hidden states enables us to achieve\\na unique solution for each block. The forget factor is utilized to control the\\ninfluence of the conditional hidden state on the prediction of the subsequent\\nblock. This new model, termed the Mutual Interval RNN (MI-RNN), is applied to\\nsolve three different benchmarks: the Burgers equation, unsteady heat\\nconduction in an irregular domain, and the Green vortex problem. Our results\\ndemonstrate that MI-RNN can find the exact solution more accurately compared to\\nexisting RNN models. For instance, in the second problem, MI-RNN achieved one\\norder of magnitude less relative error compared to the RNN model with numerical\\nderivatives.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10388v1) |\\n| Sharp decay rate for eigenfunctions of perturbed periodic Schr\\u00f6dinger\\n  operators | Wencai Liu, Rodrigo Matos, John N.

Most of the state-of-the-art architectures\\nuse transformers or diffusion-based models to perform this task, despite the\\nheavy computational burden that they require. In particular, transformers use\\nself- and cross-attention layers which have large memory footprint, while\\ndiffusion models require high inference time. To overcome the above, this paper\\nexplores a novel design of Mamba, an emergent State-Space Model (SSM), called\\nMamba-ST, to perform style transfer. To do so, we adapt Mamba linear equation\\nto simulate the behavior of cross-attention layers, which are able to combine\\ntwo separate embeddings into a single output, but drastically reducing memory\\nusage and time complexity. We modified the Mamba's inner equations so to accept\\ninputs from, and combine, two separate data streams. To the best of our\\nknowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt the equations of SSMs to a vision\\ntask like style transfer without requiring any other module like\\ncross-attention or custom normalization layers. An extensive set of experiments\\ndemonstrates the superiority and efficiency of our method in performing style\\ntransfer compared to transformers and diffusion models.

Maiti |   We present a comprehensive study on enhancing the thermoelectric (TE)\\nperformance of bilayer graphene (BLG) through irradiation with arbitrarily\\npolarized light, focusing on $AA$- and $AB$-stacked configurations with zigzag\\nedges. Utilizing a combination of tight-binding theory and density functional\\ntheory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on\\nelectronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the\\nelectronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function,\\nwhich significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the\\noverall {\\\\it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT\\ncalculations reveal that $AB$-stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal\\nconductivity compared to $AA$-stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic\\nscattering and phonon group velocity. The combined analysis shows that FOM\\nexceeds unity in both stacking types, with notable improvements near the\\nirradiation-induced gap.

This study introduces\\na novel statistical approach, TAR4C, to dissect causal interactions in\\nmultichannel EEG recordings. TAR4C uses the threshold autoregressive model to\\ndescribe the causal interaction between nodes or clusters of nodes in a brain\\nnetwork. The perspective involves testing whether one node, which may represent\\na brain region, can control the dynamics of the other. The node that has such\\nan impact on the other is called a threshold variable and can be classified as\\na causative because its functionality is the leading source operating as an\\ninstantaneous switching mechanism that regulates the time-varying\\nautoregressive structure of the other. This statistical concept is commonly\\nreferred to as threshold non-linearity. Once threshold non-linearity has been\\nverified between a pair of nodes, the subsequent essential facet of TAR\\nmodeling is to assess the predictive ability of the causal node for the current\\nactivity on the other and represent causal interactions in autoregressive\\nterms. This predictive ability is what underlies Granger causality. The TAR4C\\napproach can discover non-linear and time-dependent causal interactions without\\nnegating the G-causality perspective. The efficacy of the proposed approach is\\nexemplified by analyzing the EEG signals recorded during the motor\\nmovement/imagery experiment. The similarities and differences between the\\ncausal interactions manifesting during the execution and the imagery of a given\\nmotor movement are demonstrated by analyzing EEG recordings from multiple\\nsubjects.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10374v1) |\\n| Instigating Cooperation among LLM Agents Using Adaptive Information\\n  Modulation | Qiliang Chen,  Alireza,  Ilami, Nunzio Lore, Babak Heydari |   This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for\\nhuman strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these\\nagents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments.

We propose an LLM-based translation\\nscheme that improves the success rate of translating large-scale C code into\\ncompilable Rust code. Our approach involves three key techniques: (1)\\npre-processing the C code to better align its structure and expressions with\\nRust, (2) segmenting the code into optimally sized translation units to avoid\\nexceeding the LLM's context window limits, and (3) iteratively compiling and\\nrepairing errors while maintaining consistency between translation units using\\ncontext-supplementing prompts. Compilation success is an essential first step\\nin achieving functional equivalence, as only compilable code can be further\\ntested. In experiments with 20 benchmark C programs, including those exceeding\\n4 kilo lines of code, we successfully translated all programs into compilable\\nRust code without losing corresponding parts of the original code.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10506v1) |\\n| Machine Learning Optimization of non-Kasha Behavior and of Transient\\n  Dynamics in Model Retinal Isomerization | Davinder Singh, Chern Chuang, Paul Brumer |   Designing a model of retinal isomerization in Rhodopsin, the first step in\\nvision, that accounts for both experimental transient and stationary state\\nobservables is challenging.

Existing works often rely\\non local interpretability methods, failing to provide comprehensive\\nexplanations of the overall mechanism behind each label prediction within a\\nmultilabel set. We propose a mechanistic interpretability module called\\nDIctionary Label Attention (\\\\method) that disentangles uninterpretable dense\\nembeddings into a sparse embedding space, where each nonzero element (a\\ndictionary feature) represents a globally learned medical concept. Through\\nhuman evaluations, we show that our sparse embeddings are more human\\nunderstandable than its dense counterparts by at least 50 percent. Our\\nautomated dictionary feature identification pipeline, leveraging large language\\nmodels (LLMs), uncovers thousands of learned medical concepts by examining and\\nsummarizing the highest activating tokens for each dictionary feature. We\\nrepresent the relationships between dictionary features and medical codes\\nthrough a sparse interpretable matrix, enhancing the mechanistic and global\\nunderstanding of the model's predictions while maintaining competitive\\nperformance and scalability without extensive human annotation.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10504v1) |\\n| Causal Language Modeling Can Elicit Search and Reasoning Capabilities on\\n  Logic Puzzles | Kulin Shah, Nishanth Dikkala, Xin Wang, Rina Panigrahy |   Causal language modeling using the Transformer architecture has yielded\\nremarkable capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) over the last few\\nyears. However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning\\ncapabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this\\nwork, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as\\nsolving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to\\nsearch over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then\\napply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the\\napplication of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in\\na cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases,\\nmultiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We\\nobserve that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn\\nto solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21\\\\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly)\\nwhen trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that\\ntraining Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and\\nwithout such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis\\nto Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves\\n$92.04 \\\\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal\\nrepresentations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear\\nprobing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any\\ngiven cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine\\nimplicit in the Transformer weights.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10502v1) |\\n| Alignment with nonlinear velocity couplings: collision-avoidance and\\n  micro-to-macro mean-field limits | Young-Pil Choi, Micha\\u0142 Fabisiak, Jan Peszek |   We investigate the pressureless fractional Euler-alignment system with\\nnonlinear velocity couplings, referred to as the $p$-Euler-alignment system.\\nThis model features a nonlinear velocity alignment force, interpreted as a\\ndensity-weighted fractional $p$-Laplacian when the singularity parameter\\n$\\\\alpha$ exceeds the spatial dimension $d$. Our primary goal is to establish\\nthe existence of solutions for strongly singular interactions ($\\\\alpha \\\\ge d$)\\nand compactly supported initial conditions. We construct solutions as\\nmean-field limits of empirical measures from a kinetic variant of the\\n$p$-Euler-alignment system. Specifically, we show that a sequence of empirical\\nmeasures converges to a finite Radon measure, whose local density and velocity\\nsatisfy the $p$-Euler-alignment system. Our results are the first to prove the\\nexistence of solutions to this system in multi-dimensional settings without\\nsignificant initial data restrictions, covering both nonlinear ($p>2$) and\\nlinear ($p=2$) cases. Additionally, we establish global existence, uniqueness,\\nand collision avoidance for the corresponding particle ODE system under\\nnon-collisional initial conditions, extending previous results for $1 \\\\le p \\\\le\\n\\\\alpha + 2$. This analysis supports our mean-field limit argument and\\ncontributes to understanding alignment models with singular communication.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10501v1) |\\n| Focus diverse phase retrieval test results on broadband continuous\\n  wavefront sensing in space telescope applications | Hyukmo Kang, Kyle Van Gorkom, Meghdoot Biswas, Daewook Kim, Ewan S. Douglas |   Continuous wavefront sensing benefits space observatories in on-orbit optical\\nperformance maintenance. To measure the phase of a wavefront, phase retrieval\\nis an attractive technique as it uses multiple point spread function (PSF)\\nimages that are acquired by the telescope itself without extra metrology\\nsystems nor complicated calibration. The focus diverse phase retrieval utilizes\\nPSFs from predetermined defocused positions to enhance the dynamic range of the\\nalgorithm. We describe an updated visible light active optics testbed with the\\naddition of a linear motorized focus stage. The performance of the phase\\nretrieval algorithm in broadband is tested under various cases. While broadband\\npass filters have advantages in higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the\\nperformance of phase retrieval can be restricted due to blurred image caused by\\ndiffraction and increased computing cost. We used multiple bandpass filters (10\\nnm, 88 nm, and 150 nm) and investigated effects of bandwidth on the accuracy\\nand required image acquisition conditions such as SNR, reaching accuracies\\nbelow 20 nm RMS wavefront error at the widest bandwidth. We also investigated\\nthe dynamic range of the phase retrieval algorithm depending on the bandwidth\\nand required amount of defocus to expand dynamic range.

Geier, Javed Akram, Junichi Okamoto, Dimitris Badounas, Christof Wunderlich, Michael Johanning, Philipp Hauke |   Trapped-ion hardware based on the Magnetic Gradient Induced Coupling (MAGIC)\\nscheme is emerging as a promising platform for quantum computing. Nevertheless,\\nin this (as in any other) quantum-computing platform, many technical questions\\nstill have to be resolved before large-scale and error-tolerant applications\\nare possible. In this work, we present a thorough discussion of the\\ncontribution of higher-order terms to the MAGIC setup, which can occur due to\\nanharmonicities in the external potential of the ion crystal (e.g., through\\nCoulomb repulsion) or through curvature of the applied magnetic field. These\\nterms take the form of three-spin couplings as well as diverse terms that\\ncouple spins to phonons. We find that most of these are negligible in realistic\\nsituations, with only two contributions that need careful attention. First,\\nthere are parasitic longitudinal fields whose strength increases with chain\\nlength, but which can easily be compensated by a microwave detuning. Second,\\nanharmonicities of the Coulomb interaction can lead to well-known two-to-one\\nconversions of phonon excitations, which can be avoided if the phonons are\\nground-state cooled. Our detailed analysis constitutes an important\\ncontribution on the way of making magnetic-gradient trapped-ion quantum\\ntechnology fit for large-scale applications, and it may inspire new ways to\\npurposefully design interaction terms.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10498v1) |\\n| MusicLIME: Explainable Multimodal Music Understanding | Theodoros Sotirou, Vassilis Lyberatos, Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Stamou |   Multimodal models are critical for music understanding tasks, as they capture\\nthe complex interplay between audio and lyrics.

Ruan, Michael Eracleous, Daryl Haggard, Jessie C. Runnoe |   The physical processes that produce X-ray Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs)\\nrecently discovered from the nuclei of several low-redshift galaxies are\\nmysterious. Several pieces of observational evidence strongly suggest a link\\nbetween QPEs and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE). Previous studies also reveal\\nthat the morphologies of TDE host galaxies are highly concentrated, with high\\nSersic indicies, bulge-to-total light (B/T) ratios, and stellar surface mass\\ndensities relative to the broader galaxy population. We use these distinctive\\nproperties to test the link between QPEs and TDEs, by comparing these\\nparameters of QPE host galaxies to TDE host galaxies. We employ archival Legacy\\nSurvey images of a sample of 9 QPE host galaxies and a sample of 13 TDE host\\ngalaxies, and model their surface brightness profiles. We show that QPE host\\ngalaxies have high Sersic indices of ~3, high B/T ratios of ~0.5, and high\\nsurface mass densities of ~10^10 Msun kpc^-2. These properties are similar to\\nTDE host galaxies, but are in strong contrast to a mass- and redshift-matched\\ncontrol sample of galaxies. We also find tentative evidence that the central\\nblack holes in both QPE and TDE host galaxies are undermassive relative to\\ntheir stellar mass. The morphological similarities between QPE and TDE host\\ngalaxies at the population level add to the mounting evidence of a physical\\nlink between these phenomena, and favor QPE models that also invoke TDEs.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10486v1) |\\n| Tuning the Rate of Tightly Packed Systems To Produce Planet Occurrence\\n  Trends with Galactic Height | Sarah Ballard |   The formation of planetary systems has historically been considered in\\nisolation, decoupled from processes on galactic scales. Recent findings\\nemploying data from ESA's Gaia mission challenge this narrative, identifying\\ntrends in planet occurrence with galactic kinematics and stellar age. The\\nfindings indicate changes in planet occurrence over and above the predicted\\nchanges from metallicity variation within the Milky Way, so that changes to\\nstellar metallicity alone (long understood to be deterministic in planet\\noutcomes) cannot explain the trends entirely. The scope of potential factors\\ninfluencing planet formation has grown progressively wider, with accompanying\\ntheoretical support for galactic-scale influences upon planet formation. In\\nthis manuscript, we investigate specifically how changes to the rate of Systems\\nof Tightly-packed Inner Planets (STIPs) could manifest as a trend in planet\\noccurrence with galactic height. We focus our study upon M dwarf planetary\\nsystems for two reasons: first, they host STIPs at high rates, and secondly,\\ntheir longevity makes them useful probes for kinematic trends over Gyr. We\\nconsider two models for a varying STIP rate: one in which STIP likelihood is\\ndetermined by stellar age alone, irrespective of galactic time, and another in\\nwhich the STIP likelihood suddenly increased in recent galactic history. Both\\nmodels, which impose a higher STIP likelihood among younger stars, produce a\\nnegative gradient in planet occurrence with increasing height from the galactic\\nmidplane. We find that a step function model in which STIP likelihood increased\\nby a factor of several ~a few Gyr ago resembles an observed trend among FGK\\ndwarfs. We consider plausible physical mechanisms that could mimic the\\nhypothesized model, given known links between STIP occurrence and other stellar\\nand planetary properties.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10485v1) |\\n| XLM for Autonomous Driving Systems: A Comprehensive Review | Sonda Fourati, Wael Jaafar, Noura Baccar, Safwan Alfattani |   Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable proficiency in various\\ninformation-processing tasks.

These interactions have a particularly\\nprofound effect on excitation energies of molecules in complex environments,\\nespecially when the excitation involves a significant degree of charge\\nreorganisation. The direct reaction field (DRF) approach, which has seen a\\nrecent revival of interest, provides a powerful framework for describing these\\ninteractions in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models of\\nsystems, where a small subsystem of interest is described using quantum\\nchemical methods and the remainder is treated with a simple MM force field.

One of the classical and popular approaches is Local\\nStochastic Gradient Descent (Local SGD), characterized by multiple local\\nupdates before averaging, which is particularly useful in distributed\\nenvironments to reduce communication bottlenecks and improve scalability. A\\ntypical feature of this method is the dependence on the frequency of\\ncommunications.

As a natural consequence, subsequent studies include\\nthe assumption of a Lipschitz Hessian, as this indicates the similarity of the\\noptimized function to a quadratic one to some extent. However, in order to\\nextend the completeness of the Local SGD theory and unlock its potential, in\\nthis paper we abandon the Lipschitz Hessian assumption by introducing a new\\nconcept of $\\\\textit{approximate quadraticity}$.

However, the representation learning\\ncapacity of generative models is under-explored, especially for the skeletons\\nwith spacial sparsity and temporal redundancy. To this end, we propose Masked\\nConditional Diffusion (MacDiff) as a unified framework for human skeleton\\nmodeling. For the first time, we leverage diffusion models as effective\\nskeleton representation learners. Specifically, we train a diffusion decoder\\nconditioned on the representations extracted by a semantic encoder. Random\\nmasking is applied to encoder inputs to introduce a information bottleneck and\\nremove redundancy of skeletons. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that\\nour generative objective involves the contrastive learning objective which\\naligns the masked and noisy views. Meanwhile, it also enforces the\\nrepresentation to complement for the noisy view, leading to better\\ngeneralization performance. MacDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on\\nrepresentation learning benchmarks while maintaining the competence for\\ngenerative tasks. Moreover, we leverage the diffusion model for data\\naugmentation, significantly enhancing the fine-tuning performance in scenarios\\nwith scarce labeled data.

Hassan |   The proliferation of open Pre-trained Language Models (PTLMs) on model\\nregistry platforms like Hugging Face (HF) presents both opportunities and\\nchallenges for companies building products around them. Similar to traditional\\nsoftware dependencies, PTLMs continue to evolve after a release. However, the\\ncurrent state of release practices of PTLMs on model registry platforms are\\nplagued by a variety of inconsistencies, such as ambiguous naming conventions\\nand inaccessible model training documentation. Given the knowledge gap on\\ncurrent PTLM release practices, our empirical study uses a mixed-methods\\napproach to analyze the releases of 52,227 PTLMs on the most well-known model\\nregistry, HF. Our results reveal 148 different naming practices for PTLM\\nreleases, with 40.87% of changes to model weight files not represented in the\\nadopted name-based versioning practice or their documentation. In addition, we\\nidentified that the 52,227 PTLMs are derived from only 299 different base\\nmodels (the modified original models used to create 52,227 PTLMs), with\\nFine-tuning and Quantization being the most prevalent modification methods\\napplied to these base models. Significant gaps in release transparency, in\\nterms of training dataset specifications and model card availability, still\\nexist, highlighting the need for standardized documentation. While we\\nidentified a model naming practice explicitly differentiating between major and\\nminor PTLM releases, we did not find any significant difference in the types of\\nchanges that went into either type of releases, suggesting that major/minor\\nversion numbers for PTLMs often are chosen arbitrarily. Our findings provide\\nvaluable insights to improve PTLM release practices, nudging the field towards\\nmore formal semantic versioning practices.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10472v1) |\\n| Real-Time Whole-Body Control of Legged Robots with Model-Predictive Path\\n  Integral Control | Juan Alvarez-Padilla, John Z.

F. Lizarraga, Flavia M. D. Marquitti, Marcus A. M. de Aguiar |   We investigate the role of assortative mating in speciation using the\\nsympatric model of Derrida and Higgs. The model explores the idea that genetic\\ndifferences create incompatibilities between individuals, preventing mating if\\nthe number of such differences is too large. Speciation, however, only happens\\nin this mating system if the number of genes is large. Here we show that\\nspeciation with small genome sizes can occur if assortative mating is\\nintroduced. In our model individuals are represented by three chromosomes: one\\nresponsible for reproductive compatibility, one for coding the trait on which\\nassortativity will operate, and a neutral chromosome. Reproduction is possible\\nif individuals are genetically similar with respect to the first chromosome,\\nbut among these compatible mating partners, the one with the most similar trait\\ncoded by the second chromosome is selected. We show that this type of\\nassortativity facilitates speciation, which can happen with a small number of\\ngenes in the first chromosome. Species, classified according to reproductive\\nisolation, dictated by the first chromosome, can display different traits\\nvalues, as measured by the second and the third chromosomes. Therefore, species\\ncan also be identified based on similarity of the neutral trait, which works as\\na proxy for reproductive isolation.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10466v1) |\\n| A stabilized total pressure-formulation of the Biot's poroelasticity\\n  equations in frequency domain: numerical analysis and applications | Cristian C\\u00e1rcamo, Alfonso Caiazzo, Felipe Galarce, Joaqu\\u00edn Mura |   This work focuses on the numerical solution of the dynamics of a poroelastic\\nmaterial in the frequency domain.

Lastly, we show the application for the simulation of brain\\nelastography on a realistic brain geometry obtained from medical imaging.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10465v1) |\\n| New Direct Sum Tests | Alek Westover, Edward Yu, Kai Zheng |   A function $f:[n]^{d} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{F}_2$ is a \\\\defn{direct sum} if there are\\nfunctions $L_i:[n]\\\\to \\\\mathbb{F}_2$ such that ${f(x) = \\\\sum_{i}L_i(x_i)}$. In\\nthis work we give multiple results related to the property testing of direct\\nsums.\\n  Our first result concerns a test proposed by Dinur and Golubev in 2019. We\\ncall their test the Diamond test and show that it is indeed a direct sum\\ntester. More specifically, we show that if a function $f$ is $\\\\epsilon$-far\\nfrom being a direct sum function, then the Diamond test rejects $f$ with\\nprobability at least $\\\\Omega_{n,\\\\epsilon}(1)$. Even in the case of $n = 2$, the\\nDiamond test is, to the best of our knowledge, novel and yields a new tester\\nfor the classic property of affinity.\\n  Apart from the Diamond test, we also analyze a broad family of direct sum\\ntests, which at a high level, run an arbitrary affinity test on the restriction\\nof $f$ to a random hypercube inside of $[n]^d$. This family of tests includes\\nthe direct sum test analyzed in \\\\cite{di19}, but does not include the Diamond\\ntest.

Recently,\\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a compelling alternative,\\nutilizing highly flexible learnable activation functions directly on network\\nedges, a departure from the neuron-centric approach of MLPs. However, KANs\\nsignificantly increase the number of learnable parameters, raising concerns\\nabout their effectiveness in data-scarce environments. This paper presents a\\ncomprehensive comparative study of MLPs and KANs from both algorithmic and\\nexperimental perspectives, with a focus on low-data regimes. We introduce an\\neffective technique for designing MLPs with unique, parameterized activation\\nfunctions for each neuron, enabling a more balanced comparison with KANs. Using\\nempirical evaluations on simulated data and two real-world data sets from\\nmedicine and engineering, we explore the trade-offs between model complexity\\nand accuracy, with particular attention to the role of network depth. Our\\nfindings show that MLPs with individualized activation functions achieve\\nsignificantly higher predictive accuracy with only a modest increase in\\nparameters, especially when the sample size is limited to around one hundred.\\nFor example, in a three-class classification problem within additive\\nmanufacturing, MLPs achieve a median accuracy of 0.91, significantly\\noutperforming KANs, which only reach a median accuracy of 0.53 with default\\nhyperparameters. These results offer valuable insights into the impact of\\nactivation function selection in neural networks.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10463v1) |\\n| Effects of synapse location, delay and background stochastic activity on\\n  synchronising hippocampal CA1 neurons | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore |   We study the synchronisation of neurons in a realistic model under the\\nHodgkin-Huxley dynamics. To focus on the role of the different locations of the\\nexcitatory synapses, we use two identical neurons where the set of input\\nsignals is grouped at two different distances from the soma. The system is\\nintended to represent a CA1 hippocampal neuron in which the synapses arriving\\nfrom the CA3 neurons of the trisynaptic pathway appear to be localised in the\\napical dendritic region and are, in principle, either proximal or distal to the\\nsoma. Synchronisation is studied using a specifically defined spiking\\ncorrelation function as a function of various parameters such as the distance\\nfrom the soma of one of the synaptic groups, the inhibition weight and the\\nassociated activation delay. We found that the neurons' spiking activity\\ndepends nonmonotonically on the relative dendritic location of the synapses and\\ntheir inhibitory weight, whereas the synchronisation measure always decreases\\nwith inhibition, and strongly depends on its activation time delay. The\\nbackground activity on the somas results essentially independent on the\\nfluctuation intensity and strongly support the importance of the balance\\nbetween inhibition and excitation for neuronal synchronization.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10460v1) |\\n| Efficiently Crowdsourcing Visual Importance with Punch-Hole Annotation | Minsuk Chang, Soohyun Lee, Aeri Cho, Hyeon Jeon, Seokhyeon Park, Cindy Xiong Bearfield, Jinwook Seo |   We introduce a novel crowdsourcing method for identifying important areas in\\ngraphical images through punch-hole labeling. Traditional methods, such as gaze\\ntrackers and mouse-based annotations, which generate continuous data, can be\\nimpractical in crowdsourcing scenarios. They require many participants, and the\\noutcome data can be noisy. In contrast, our method first segments the graphical\\nimage with a grid and drops a portion of the patches (punch holes). Then, we\\niteratively ask the labeler to validate each annotation with holes, narrowing\\ndown the annotation only having the most important area. This approach aims to\\nreduce annotation noise in crowdsourcing by standardizing the annotations while\\nenhancing labeling efficiency and reliability. Preliminary findings from\\nfundamental charts demonstrate that punch-hole labeling can effectively\\npinpoint critical regions. This also highlights its potential for broader\\napplication in visualization research, particularly in studying large-scale\\nusers' graphical perception. Our future work aims to enhance the algorithm to\\nachieve faster labeling speed and prove its utility through large-scale\\nexperiments.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10459v1) |\\n| Full distribution of local observables in an exactly solvable current\\n  carrying steady states of a driven XXZ chain | Sandipan Manna, G J Sreejith |   Current carrying steady states of interacting spins chains exhibit rich\\nstructures generated through an interplay of current induced correlations and\\nenergetic constraints from the Hamiltonian. The XXZ spin chain when coupled to\\nmaximally polarizing Lindblad terms admits an exact solution in a matrix\\nproduct state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations\\nand distributions of simple local spin observables in the non equilibrium\\nsteady state (NESS).

Bottke, Robert Jedicke, Shantanu Naidu, Steven R. Chesley, Davide Farnocchia, Paul W. Chodas |   This work is dedicated to debias the Near-Earth Objects (NEO) population\\nbased on observations from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System\\n(ATLAS) telescopes. We have applied similar methods used to develop the\\nrecently released NEO model generator (NEOMOD), once debiasing the NEO\\npopulation using data from Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) G96 telescope. ATLAS is\\ncomposed of four different telescopes. We first analyzed observational data\\nfrom each of all four telescopes separately and later combined them. Our\\nresults highlight main differences between CSS and ATLAS, e.g., sky coverage\\nand survey power at debiasing the NEO population. ATLAS has a much larger sky\\ncoverage than CSS, allowing it to find bright NEOs that would be constantly\\n\\\"hiding\\\" from CSS. Consequently, ATLAS is more powerful than CSS at debiasing\\nthe NEO population for H $\\\\lesssim$ 19. With its intrinsically greater\\nsensitivity and emphasis on observing near opposition, CSS excels in the\\ndebiasing of smaller objects. ATLAS, as an all sky survey designed to find\\nimminent hazardous objects, necessarily spends a significant fraction of time\\nlooking at places on the sky where objects do not appear, reducing its power\\nfor debiasing the population of small objects. We estimate a NEO population\\ncompleteness of $\\\\approx$ 88%$^{+3\\\\%}_{-2\\\\%}$ for H $<$ 17.75 and $\\\\approx$\\n36%$^{+1\\\\%}_{-1\\\\%}$ for H $<$ 22.25.

Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited\\nfocus on developing and evaluating explainable neural-based graph generative\\nmodels specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we\\npropose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE\\nextracts node-level representations that express node memberships over distinct\\nextreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is\\nachieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its\\npolarization.

Recent advancements in markerless pose\\nestimation methods have eliminated the need for time-consuming physical setups\\nfor camera-to-robot calibration. While the existing markerless pose estimation\\nmethods have demonstrated impressive accuracy without the need for cumbersome\\nsetups, they rely on the assumption that all the robot joints are visible\\nwithin the camera's field of view.

The vast majority of\\nenergy-preserving reduced-order methods use symplectic Galerkin projection to\\nconstruct reduced-order Hamiltonian models by projecting the full models onto a\\nsymplectic subspace. However, symplectic projection requires the existence of\\nfully discrete operators, and in many cases, such as black-box PDE solvers,\\nthese operators are inaccessible. In this work, we propose an energy-preserving\\nmachine learning method that can infer the dynamics of the given PDE using data\\nonly, so that the proposed framework does not depend on the fully discrete\\noperators. In this context, the proposed method is non-intrusive. The proposed\\nmethod is grey box in the sense that it requires only some basic knowledge of\\nthe multi-symplectic model at the partial differential equation level. We prove\\nthat the proposed method satisfies spatially discrete local energy conservation\\nand preserves the multi-symplectic conservation laws. We test our method on the\\nlinear wave equation, the Korteweg-de Vries equation, and the\\nZakharov-Kuznetsov equation.

Given a text query, RGS\\ndetermines a stable grasp pose to manipulate the referred object in the robot's\\nworkspace. RGS comprises two steps: visual grounding and grasp pose estimation.\\nRecent studies leverage powerful Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for visually\\ngrounding free-flowing natural language in real-world robotic execution.\\nHowever, comparisons in complex, cluttered environments with multiple instances\\nof the same object are lacking. This paper introduces HiFi-CS, featuring\\nhierarchical application of Featurewise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to fuse image\\nand text embeddings, enhancing visual grounding for complex attribute rich text\\nqueries encountered in robotic grasping.

Papoutsis, I. E. Papadakis, C. Panagiotou, M. Dov\\u010diak, E. Kammoun |   Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to be variable across all\\nwavelengths. Significant observational efforts have been invested in the last\\ndecade in studying their ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability. Long and\\ndensely sampled, multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns of numerous Seyfert\\ngalaxies have been conducted with the aim of determining the X-ray/UV/optical\\ncontinuum time lags. Time-lag studies can be used to constrain theoretical\\nmodels. The observed time lags can be explained by thermal reprocessing of the\\nX-rays illuminating the accretion disc (known as the X-ray reverberation\\nmodel). However, the observed light curves contain more information that can be\\nused to further constrain physical models. Our primary objective is to\\ninvestigate whether, in addition to time lags, the X-ray reverberation model\\ncan also explain the UV/optical variability amplitude of nearby Seyferts. To do\\nthis, we measured the excess variance of four sources (namely Mrk 509, NGC\\n4151, NGC 2617, and Mrk 142) as a function of wavelength using data from\\narchival long, multi-wavelength campaigns with Swift, and ground-based\\ntelescopes. We also computed the model excess variance in the case of the X-ray\\nreverberation model by determining the disc's transfer function and assuming a\\nbending power law for the X-ray power spectrum. We tested the validity of the\\nmodel by comparing the measured and model variances for a range of accretion\\nrates and X-ray source heights. We conclude that the X-ray thermal\\nreverberation model can fit both the continuum, UV/optical time lags, as well\\nas the variance in these AGNs, for the same physical parameters. Our results\\nsuggest that the accretion disc is constant and that all the observed\\nUV/optical variations, on timescales of days and up to a few weeks, can be\\nfully explained by the variable X-rays as they illuminate the accretion disc.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10417v1) |\\n| Local central limit theorem for Mallows measure | Alexey Bufetov, Kailun Chen |   We study the statistics of the Mallows measure on permutations in the limit\\npioneered by Starr (2009).

It covers 158\\nwidely-used SDKs from two key SDK release platforms, the official one and a\\nlarge alternative one. From them, we identified 338 instances of privacy data\\nexfiltration.

However, our calculations\\nrevealed that the exponent parameters in both the drift and variance terms\\ndeviate slightly from one. This suggests that Gibrat's proportional growth rule\\nalone does not fully explain the log-normal distribution observed in Bitcoin\\nusers' balances. During our exploration, we discovered an intriguing\\nphenomenon: Bitcoin users tend to fall into two distinct categories based on\\ntheir behavior, which we refer to as ``poor\\\" and ``wealthy\\\" users. Poor users,\\nwho initially purchase only a small amount of Bitcoin, tend to buy more\\nbitcoins first and then sell out all their holdings gradually over time.

Since it offers a well-motivated starting point for\\nthe study of physics at very high energies, we incorporate an $R^2$ term in the\\nPalatini gravity. In addition, afterward the inflation, the inflaton oscillates\\nabout the minimum of the inflation potential, and reheats the universe. This\\noccurs during the reheating phase, at which the inflaton decays into the\\nstandard model particles, which fill the universe. We extend our examination by\\nconsidering the reheating effects on inflationary observables by employing the\\ndifferent scenarios of the reheat temperature. Supposing the standard thermal\\nhistory after inflation, we display the inflationary predictions, $n_s, r,\\n\\\\mathrm{d}n_s/\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\ln k$ of $\\\\beta$-exponential potential with minimal\\ncoupling in Palatini $R^2$ gravity. Also, different kinds of constraints from a\\nvariety of observations, such as BICEP/Keck, Planck 2018, as well as future\\npossible detectable sensitivities that might be reached by CMB experiments:\\nCMB-S4 and LiteBIRD are taken into account in this work. We indicate that our\\nresults are consistent with both the latest data and the future sensitivity\\nforecasts of LiteBIRD/Planck and CMB-S4. Finally, the results in this study\\nhighlight the viability of our model even in the case of the existence of more\\nstringent constraints expected from future achievable confidence level limits.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10398v1) |\\n| Quantifying Observational Projection Effects with a Simulation-based hot\\n  CGM model | Soumya Shreeram, Johan Comparat, Andrea Merloni, Yi Zhang, Gabriele Ponti, Kirpal Nandra, John ZuHone, Ilaria Marini, Stephan Vladutescu-Zopp, Paola Popesso, Ruediger Pakmor, Riccardo Seppi, Celine Peroux, Daniele Sorini |   The hot phase of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) allows us to probe the\\ninflow and outflow of gas within a galaxy, which is responsible for dictating\\nthe evolution of the galaxy.

With the recent advances in observational measurements\\nprobing the hot CGM in X-rays and tSZ, we have a new avenue for widening our\\nknowledge of gas physics and feedback by exploiting the information from\\ncurrent/future observations. In this paper, we use the TNG300 hydrodynamical\\nsimulations to build a fully self-consistent forward model for the hot CGM. We\\nconstruct a lightcone and generate mock X-ray observations.

To mitigate this issue, downstream\\ntask-oriented reconstruction optimization has been proposed for a single\\ndownstream task. Expanding this optimization to multi-task scenarios is not\\nstraightforward. In this work, we extended this optimization to sequentially\\nintroduced multiple downstream tasks and demonstrated that a single MR\\nreconstruction network can be optimized for multiple downstream tasks by\\ndeploying continual learning (MOST). MOST integrated techniques from\\nreplay-based continual learning and image-guided loss to overcome catastrophic\\nforgetting.

The majority of work that has been\\ndone is focused on Deep Learning (DL) based approaches. However, with the\\nemergence of new algorithms such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm, there\\nis growing interest in exploring alternative approaches that may offer unique\\nadvantages in certain domains or applications. One of these domains is\\nFederated Learning (FL), in which users privacy is of utmost importance. Due to\\nits novelty, FL has seen a surge in the incorporation of personalization\\ntechniques to enhance model accuracy while maintaining user privacy under\\npersonalized conditions. In this work, we propose a novel approach dubbed TPFL:\\nTsetlin-Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into\\nclusters based on their confidence towards a specific class. In this way,\\nclustering can benefit from two key advantages. Firstly, clients share only\\nwhat they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight\\naggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been\\nenough during the training. This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are\\nnon-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID). Secondly, by sharing\\nonly weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially\\nreduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication\\ncost. The results of TPFL demonstrated the highest accuracy on three different\\ndatasets; namely MNIST, FashionMNIST and FEMNIST.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10392v1) |\\n| Prompt-and-Transfer: Dynamic Class-aware Enhancement for Few-shot\\n  Segmentation | Hanbo Bi, Yingchao Feng, Wenhui Diao, Peijin Wang, Yongqiang Mao, Kun Fu, Hongqi Wang, Xian Sun |   For more efficient generalization to unseen domains (classes), most Few-shot\\nSegmentation (FSS) would directly exploit pre-trained encoders and only\\nfine-tune the decoder, especially in the current era of large models. However,\\nsuch fixed feature encoders tend to be class-agnostic, inevitably activating\\nobjects that are irrelevant to the target class. In contrast, humans can\\neffortlessly focus on specific objects in the line of sight. This paper mimics\\nthe visual perception pattern of human beings and proposes a novel and powerful\\nprompt-driven scheme, called ``Prompt and Transfer\\\" (PAT), which constructs a\\ndynamic class-aware prompting paradigm to tune the encoder for focusing on the\\ninterested object (target class) in the current task. Three key points are\\nelaborated to enhance the prompting: 1) Cross-modal linguistic information is\\nintroduced to initialize prompts for each task. 2) Semantic Prompt Transfer\\n(SPT) that precisely transfers the class-specific semantics within the images\\nto prompts. 3) Part Mask Generator (PMG) that works in conjunction with SPT to\\nadaptively generate different but complementary part prompts for different\\nindividuals. Surprisingly, PAT achieves competitive performance on 4 different\\ntasks including standard FSS, Cross-domain FSS (e.g., CV, medical, and remote\\nsensing domains), Weak-label FSS, and Zero-shot Segmentation, setting new\\nstate-of-the-arts on 11 benchmarks.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10389v1) |\\n| Revising the Structure of Recurrent Neural Networks to Eliminate\\n  Numerical Derivatives in Forming Physics Informed Loss Terms with Respect to\\n  Time | Mahyar Jahani-nasab, Mohamad Ali Bijarchi |   Solving unsteady partial differential equations (PDEs) using recurrent neural\\nnetworks (RNNs) typically requires numerical derivatives between each block of\\nthe RNN to form the physics informed loss function. However, this introduces\\nthe complexities of numerical derivatives into the training process of these\\nmodels. In this study, we propose modifying the structure of the traditional\\nRNN to enable the prediction of each block over a time interval, making it\\npossible to calculate the derivative of the output with respect to time using\\nthe backpropagation algorithm. To achieve this, the time intervals of these\\nblocks are overlapped, defining a mutual loss function between them.\\nAdditionally, the employment of conditional hidden states enables us to achieve\\na unique solution for each block. The forget factor is utilized to control the\\ninfluence of the conditional hidden state on the prediction of the subsequent\\nblock. This new model, termed the Mutual Interval RNN (MI-RNN), is applied to\\nsolve three different benchmarks: the Burgers equation, unsteady heat\\nconduction in an irregular domain, and the Green vortex problem. Our results\\ndemonstrate that MI-RNN can find the exact solution more accurately compared to\\nexisting RNN models. For instance, in the second problem, MI-RNN achieved one\\norder of magnitude less relative error compared to the RNN model with numerical\\nderivatives.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10388v1) |\\n| Sharp decay rate for eigenfunctions of perturbed periodic Schr\\u00f6dinger\\n  operators | Wencai Liu, Rodrigo Matos, John N.

Most of the state-of-the-art architectures\\nuse transformers or diffusion-based models to perform this task, despite the\\nheavy computational burden that they require. In particular, transformers use\\nself- and cross-attention layers which have large memory footprint, while\\ndiffusion models require high inference time. To overcome the above, this paper\\nexplores a novel design of Mamba, an emergent State-Space Model (SSM), called\\nMamba-ST, to perform style transfer. To do so, we adapt Mamba linear equation\\nto simulate the behavior of cross-attention layers, which are able to combine\\ntwo separate embeddings into a single output, but drastically reducing memory\\nusage and time complexity. We modified the Mamba's inner equations so to accept\\ninputs from, and combine, two separate data streams. To the best of our\\nknowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt the equations of SSMs to a vision\\ntask like style transfer without requiring any other module like\\ncross-attention or custom normalization layers. An extensive set of experiments\\ndemonstrates the superiority and efficiency of our method in performing style\\ntransfer compared to transformers and diffusion models.

Maiti |   We present a comprehensive study on enhancing the thermoelectric (TE)\\nperformance of bilayer graphene (BLG) through irradiation with arbitrarily\\npolarized light, focusing on $AA$- and $AB$-stacked configurations with zigzag\\nedges. Utilizing a combination of tight-binding theory and density functional\\ntheory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on\\nelectronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the\\nelectronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function,\\nwhich significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the\\noverall {\\\\it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT\\ncalculations reveal that $AB$-stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal\\nconductivity compared to $AA$-stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic\\nscattering and phonon group velocity. The combined analysis shows that FOM\\nexceeds unity in both stacking types, with notable improvements near the\\nirradiation-induced gap. Additionally, we explore the dependence of FOM on the\\nsystem dimensions and temperature, demonstrating that light-irradiated BLG\\nholds great promise for efficient thermoelectric energy conversion and waste\\nheat recovery. Our results show favorable responses over a wide range of\\nirradiation parameters. These findings provide crucial insights into optimizing\\nBLG for advanced TE applications through light-induced modifications.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10380v1) |\\n| Leveraging Joint Spectral and Spatial Learning with MAMBA for\\n  Multichannel Speech Enhancement | Wenze Ren, Haibin Wu, Yi-Cheng Lin, Xuanjun Chen, Rong Chao, Kuo-Hsuan Hung, You-Jin Li, Wen-Yuan Ting, Hsin-Min Wang, Yu Tsao |   In multichannel speech enhancement, effectively capturing spatial and\\nspectral information across different microphones is crucial for noise\\nreduction.

This study introduces\\na novel statistical approach, TAR4C, to dissect causal interactions in\\nmultichannel EEG recordings. TAR4C uses the threshold autoregressive model to\\ndescribe the causal interaction between nodes or clusters of nodes in a brain\\nnetwork. The perspective involves testing whether one node, which may represent\\na brain region, can control the dynamics of the other. The node that has such\\nan impact on the other is called a threshold variable and can be classified as\\na causative because its functionality is the leading source operating as an\\ninstantaneous switching mechanism that regulates the time-varying\\nautoregressive structure of the other. This statistical concept is commonly\\nreferred to as threshold non-linearity. Once threshold non-linearity has been\\nverified between a pair of nodes, the subsequent essential facet of TAR\\nmodeling is to assess the predictive ability of the causal node for the current\\nactivity on the other and represent causal interactions in autoregressive\\nterms. This predictive ability is what underlies Granger causality. The TAR4C\\napproach can discover non-linear and time-dependent causal interactions without\\nnegating the G-causality perspective. The efficacy of the proposed approach is\\nexemplified by analyzing the EEG signals recorded during the motor\\nmovement/imagery experiment. The similarities and differences between the\\ncausal interactions manifesting during the execution and the imagery of a given\\nmotor movement are demonstrated by analyzing EEG recordings from multiple\\nsubjects.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10374v1) |\\n| Instigating Cooperation among LLM Agents Using Adaptive Information\\n  Modulation | Qiliang Chen,  Alireza,  Ilami, Nunzio Lore, Babak Heydari |   This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for\\nhuman strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these\\nagents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments.

However, the quadratic time complexity of attention\\noperation poses a significant challenge for scaling to longer contexts due to\\nthe extremely high inference latency and GPU memory consumption for caching\\nkey-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free\\napproach to accelerate attention computation. To leverage the dynamic sparse\\nproperty of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor\\nsearch (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most\\nrelevant ones via vector search during generation. Due to the\\nout-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors, off-the-shelf\\nANNS indexes still need to scan O(N) (usually 30% of all keys) data for\\naccurate retrieval, which fails to exploit the high sparsity.\\nRetrievalAttention first identifies the OOD challenge of ANNS-based attention,\\nand addresses it via an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt\\nto queries and only access 1--3% of data, thus achieving a sub-linear time\\ncomplexity. RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of\\nlong-context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the\\nmodel accuracy. Especially, RetrievalAttention only needs 16GB GPU memory for\\nserving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating\\none token in 0.188 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB).\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516v1) |\\n| An Efficient Self-Learning Framework For Interactive Spoken Dialog\\n  Systems | Hitesh Tulsiani, David M.

Unfortunately, traditional automatic speech\\nrecognition (ASR) systems deployed in such applications are usually trained to\\nrecognize each turn independently and lack the ability to adapt to the\\nconversational context or incorporate user feedback. In this work, we introduce\\na general framework for ASR in dialog systems that can go beyond learning from\\nsingle-turn utterances and learn over time how to adapt to both explicit\\nsupervision and implicit user feedback present in multi-turn conversations. We\\naccomplish that by leveraging advances in student-teacher learning and\\ncontext-aware dialog processing, and designing contrastive self-supervision\\napproaches with Ohm, a new online hard-negative mining approach. We show that\\nleveraging our new framework compared to traditional training leads to relative\\nWER reductions of close to 10% in real-world dialog systems, and up to 26% on\\npublic synthetic data.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10515v1) |\\n| Constraints on axions from patchy screening of the cosmic microwave\\n  background | Samuel Goldstein, Fiona McCarthy, Cristina Mondino, J.

We propose an LLM-based translation\\nscheme that improves the success rate of translating large-scale C code into\\ncompilable Rust code. Our approach involves three key techniques: (1)\\npre-processing the C code to better align its structure and expressions with\\nRust, (2) segmenting the code into optimally sized translation units to avoid\\nexceeding the LLM's context window limits, and (3) iteratively compiling and\\nrepairing errors while maintaining consistency between translation units using\\ncontext-supplementing prompts. Compilation success is an essential first step\\nin achieving functional equivalence, as only compilable code can be further\\ntested.

However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning\\ncapabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this\\nwork, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as\\nsolving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to\\nsearch over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then\\napply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the\\napplication of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in\\na cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases,\\nmultiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We\\nobserve that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn\\nto solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21\\\\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly)\\nwhen trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that\\ntraining Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and\\nwithout such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis\\nto Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves\\n$92.04 \\\\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal\\nrepresentations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear\\nprobing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any\\ngiven cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine\\nimplicit in the Transformer weights.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10502v1) |\\n| Alignment with nonlinear velocity couplings: collision-avoidance and\\n  micro-to-macro mean-field limits | Young-Pil Choi, Micha\\u0142 Fabisiak, Jan Peszek |   We investigate the pressureless fractional Euler-alignment system with\\nnonlinear velocity couplings, referred to as the $p$-Euler-alignment system.\\nThis model features a nonlinear velocity alignment force, interpreted as a\\ndensity-weighted fractional $p$-Laplacian when the singularity parameter\\n$\\\\alpha$ exceeds the spatial dimension $d$.

Nevertheless,\\nin this (as in any other) quantum-computing platform, many technical questions\\nstill have to be resolved before large-scale and error-tolerant applications\\nare possible. In this work, we present a thorough discussion of the\\ncontribution of higher-order terms to the MAGIC setup, which can occur due to\\nanharmonicities in the external potential of the ion crystal (e.g., through\\nCoulomb repulsion) or through curvature of the applied magnetic field. These\\nterms take the form of three-spin couplings as well as diverse terms that\\ncouple spins to phonons.

First,\\nthere are parasitic longitudinal fields whose strength increases with chain\\nlength, but which can easily be compensated by a microwave detuning. Second,\\nanharmonicities of the Coulomb interaction can lead to well-known two-to-one\\nconversions of phonon excitations, which can be avoided if the phonons are\\nground-state cooled.

Ruan, Michael Eracleous, Daryl Haggard, Jessie C. Runnoe |   The physical processes that produce X-ray Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs)\\nrecently discovered from the nuclei of several low-redshift galaxies are\\nmysterious. Several pieces of observational evidence strongly suggest a link\\nbetween QPEs and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE). Previous studies also reveal\\nthat the morphologies of TDE host galaxies are highly concentrated, with high\\nSersic indicies, bulge-to-total light (B/T) ratios, and stellar surface mass\\ndensities relative to the broader galaxy population. We use these distinctive\\nproperties to test the link between QPEs and TDEs, by comparing these\\nparameters of QPE host galaxies to TDE host galaxies. We employ archival Legacy\\nSurvey images of a sample of 9 QPE host galaxies and a sample of 13 TDE host\\ngalaxies, and model their surface brightness profiles. We show that QPE host\\ngalaxies have high Sersic indices of ~3, high B/T ratios of ~0.5, and high\\nsurface mass densities of ~10^10 Msun kpc^-2. These properties are similar to\\nTDE host galaxies, but are in strong contrast to a mass- and redshift-matched\\ncontrol sample of galaxies. We also find tentative evidence that the central\\nblack holes in both QPE and TDE host galaxies are undermassive relative to\\ntheir stellar mass. The morphological similarities between QPE and TDE host\\ngalaxies at the population level add to the mounting evidence of a physical\\nlink between these phenomena, and favor QPE models that also invoke TDEs.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10486v1) |\\n| Tuning the Rate of Tightly Packed Systems To Produce Planet Occurrence\\n  Trends with Galactic Height | Sarah Ballard |   The formation of planetary systems has historically been considered in\\nisolation, decoupled from processes on galactic scales. Recent findings\\nemploying data from ESA's Gaia mission challenge this narrative, identifying\\ntrends in planet occurrence with galactic kinematics and stellar age. The\\nfindings indicate changes in planet occurrence over and above the predicted\\nchanges from metallicity variation within the Milky Way, so that changes to\\nstellar metallicity alone (long understood to be deterministic in planet\\noutcomes) cannot explain the trends entirely. The scope of potential factors\\ninfluencing planet formation has grown progressively wider, with accompanying\\ntheoretical support for galactic-scale influences upon planet formation. In\\nthis manuscript, we investigate specifically how changes to the rate of Systems\\nof Tightly-packed Inner Planets (STIPs) could manifest as a trend in planet\\noccurrence with galactic height. We focus our study upon M dwarf planetary\\nsystems for two reasons: first, they host STIPs at high rates, and secondly,\\ntheir longevity makes them useful probes for kinematic trends over Gyr. We\\nconsider two models for a varying STIP rate: one in which STIP likelihood is\\ndetermined by stellar age alone, irrespective of galactic time, and another in\\nwhich the STIP likelihood suddenly increased in recent galactic history. Both\\nmodels, which impose a higher STIP likelihood among younger stars, produce a\\nnegative gradient in planet occurrence with increasing height from the galactic\\nmidplane. We find that a step function model in which STIP likelihood increased\\nby a factor of several ~a few Gyr ago resembles an observed trend among FGK\\ndwarfs. We consider plausible physical mechanisms that could mimic the\\nhypothesized model, given known links between STIP occurrence and other stellar\\nand planetary properties.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10485v1) |\\n| XLM for Autonomous Driving Systems: A Comprehensive Review | Sonda Fourati, Wael Jaafar, Noura Baccar, Safwan Alfattani |   Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable proficiency in various\\ninformation-processing tasks.

Fay, Nicolas Ferr\\u00e9, Miquel Huix-Rotllant |   Electronic polarization and dispersion are decisive actors in determining\\ninteraction energies between molecules. These interactions have a particularly\\nprofound effect on excitation energies of molecules in complex environments,\\nespecially when the excitation involves a significant degree of charge\\nreorganisation. The direct reaction field (DRF) approach, which has seen a\\nrecent revival of interest, provides a powerful framework for describing these\\ninteractions in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models of\\nsystems, where a small subsystem of interest is described using quantum\\nchemical methods and the remainder is treated with a simple MM force field. In\\nthis paper we show how the DRF approach can be combined with the electrostatic\\npotential fitted (ESPF) multipole operator description of the QM region charge\\ndensity, which reduces the scaling $\\\\mathcal{O}(N_\\\\mathrm{MM}^3)$ of the method\\nwith MM system to $\\\\mathcal{O}(N_\\\\mathrm{MM}^2)$. We also show how the DRF\\napproach can be combined with fluctuating charge descriptions of the\\npolarizable environment, as well as previously used atom-centred\\ndipole-polarizability based models. We further show that the ESPF-DRF method\\nprovides an accurate description of molecular interactions in both ground and\\nexcited electronic states of the QM system and apply it to predict the gas to\\naqueous solution solvatochromic shifts in the UV/visible absorption spectrum of\\nacrolein.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10483v1) |\\n| Schrodinger's Memory: Large Language Models | Wei Wang, Qing Li |   Memory is the foundation of LLMs' functionality, yet past research has lacked\\nan in-depth exploration of their memory capabilities and underlying theory.

These assumptions limit their use\\nwhen acquisition conditions, such as the subject's distance from the camera or\\nthe camera's characteristics, are different than expected, as typically happens\\nin video surveillance. Additionally, 3DFR algorithms follow various strategies\\nto address the reconstruction of a 3D shape from 2D data, such as statistical\\nmodel fitting, photometric stereo, or deep learning. In the present study, we\\nexplore the application of three 3DFR algorithms representative of the SOTA,\\nemploying each one as the template set generator for a face verification\\nsystem. The scores provided by each system are combined by score-level fusion.\\nWe show that the complementarity induced by different 3DFR algorithms improves\\nperformance when tests are conducted at never-seen-before distances from the\\ncamera and camera characteristics (cross-distance and cross-camera settings),\\nthus encouraging further investigations on multiple 3DFR-based approaches.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10481v1) |\\n| Addressing misspecification in contextual optimization | Omar Bennouna, Jiawei Zhang, Saurabh Amin, Asuman Ozdaglar |   We study a linear contextual optimization problem where a decision maker has\\naccess to historical data and contextual features to learn a cost prediction\\nmodel aimed at minimizing decision error.

Given that perfect model alignment with reality is\\noften unrealistic in practice, we focus on scenarios where the chosen\\nhypothesis set is misspecified. In this context, it remains unclear whether\\ncurrent contextual optimization approaches can effectively address such model\\nmisspecification. In this paper, we present a novel integrated learning and\\noptimization approach designed to tackle model misspecification in contextual\\noptimization. This approach offers theoretical generalizability, tractability,\\nand optimality guarantees, along with strong practical performance. Our method\\ninvolves minimizing a tractable surrogate loss that aligns with the performance\\nvalue from cost vector predictions, regardless of whether the model\\nmisspecified or not, and can be optimized in reasonable time.

One of the classical and popular approaches is Local\\nStochastic Gradient Descent (Local SGD), characterized by multiple local\\nupdates before averaging, which is particularly useful in distributed\\nenvironments to reduce communication bottlenecks and improve scalability. A\\ntypical feature of this method is the dependence on the frequency of\\ncommunications. But in the case of a quadratic target function with homogeneous\\ndata distribution over all devices, the influence of frequency of\\ncommunications vanishes. As a natural consequence, subsequent studies include\\nthe assumption of a Lipschitz Hessian, as this indicates the similarity of the\\noptimized function to a quadratic one to some extent. However, in order to\\nextend the completeness of the Local SGD theory and unlock its potential, in\\nthis paper we abandon the Lipschitz Hessian assumption by introducing a new\\nconcept of $\\\\textit{approximate quadraticity}$. This assumption gives a new\\nperspective on problems that have near quadratic properties. In addition,\\nexisting theoretical analyses of Local SGD often assume bounded variance. We,\\nin turn, consider the unbounded noise condition, which allows us to broaden the\\nclass of studied problems.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10478v1) |\\n| SimInversion: A Simple Framework for Inversion-Based Text-to-Image\\n  Editing | Qi Qian, Haiyang Xu, Ming Yan, Juhua Hu |   Diffusion models demonstrate impressive image generation performance with\\ntext guidance. Inspired by the learning process of diffusion, existing images\\ncan be edited according to text by DDIM inversion. However, the vanilla DDIM\\ninversion is not optimized for classifier-free guidance and the accumulated\\nerror will result in the undesired performance. While many algorithms are\\ndeveloped to improve the framework of DDIM inversion for editing, in this work,\\nwe investigate the approximation error in DDIM inversion and propose to\\ndisentangle the guidance scale for the source and target branches to reduce the\\nerror while keeping the original framework. Moreover, a better guidance scale\\n(i.e., 0.5) than default settings can be derived theoretically. Experiments on\\nPIE-Bench show that our proposal can improve the performance of DDIM inversion\\ndramatically without sacrificing efficiency.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10476v1) |\\n| Leadership and Engagement Dynamics in Legislative Twitter Networks:\\n  Statistical Analysis and Modeling | Carolina Luque, Juan Sosa |   In this manuscript, we analyze the interaction network on Twitter among\\nmembers of the 117th U.S. Congress to assess the visibility of political\\nleaders and explore how systemic properties and node attributes influence the\\nformation of legislative connections. We employ descriptive social network\\nstatistical methods, the exponential random graph model (ERGM), and the\\nstochastic block model (SBM) to evaluate the relative impact of network\\nsystemic properties, as well as institutional and personal traits, on the\\ngeneration of online relationships among legislators. Our findings reveal that\\nlegislative networks on social media platforms like Twitter tend to reinforce\\nthe leadership of dominant political actors rather than diminishing their\\ninfluence.

Additionally, we highlight that online connections within\\nlegislative networks are influenced by both the systemic properties of the\\nnetwork and institutional characteristics.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10475v1) |\\n| MacDiff: Unified Skeleton Modeling with Masked Conditional Diffusion | Lehong Wu, Lilang Lin, Jiahang Zhang, Yiyang Ma, Jiaying Liu |   Self-supervised learning has proved effective for skeleton-based human action\\nunderstanding. However, previous works either rely on contrastive learning that\\nsuffers false negative problems or are based on reconstruction that learns too\\nmuch unessential low-level clues, leading to limited representations for\\ndownstream tasks. Recently, great advances have been made in generative\\nlearning, which is naturally a challenging yet meaningful pretext task to model\\nthe general underlying data distributions. However, the representation learning\\ncapacity of generative models is under-explored, especially for the skeletons\\nwith spacial sparsity and temporal redundancy. To this end, we propose Masked\\nConditional Diffusion (MacDiff) as a unified framework for human skeleton\\nmodeling. For the first time, we leverage diffusion models as effective\\nskeleton representation learners. Specifically, we train a diffusion decoder\\nconditioned on the representations extracted by a semantic encoder. Random\\nmasking is applied to encoder inputs to introduce a information bottleneck and\\nremove redundancy of skeletons. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that\\nour generative objective involves the contrastive learning objective which\\naligns the masked and noisy views. Meanwhile, it also enforces the\\nrepresentation to complement for the noisy view, leading to better\\ngeneralization performance. MacDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on\\nrepresentation learning benchmarks while maintaining the competence for\\ngenerative tasks. Moreover, we leverage the diffusion model for data\\naugmentation, significantly enhancing the fine-tuning performance in scenarios\\nwith scarce labeled data.

Hassan |   The proliferation of open Pre-trained Language Models (PTLMs) on model\\nregistry platforms like Hugging Face (HF) presents both opportunities and\\nchallenges for companies building products around them. Similar to traditional\\nsoftware dependencies, PTLMs continue to evolve after a release. However, the\\ncurrent state of release practices of PTLMs on model registry platforms are\\nplagued by a variety of inconsistencies, such as ambiguous naming conventions\\nand inaccessible model training documentation. Given the knowledge gap on\\ncurrent PTLM release practices, our empirical study uses a mixed-methods\\napproach to analyze the releases of 52,227 PTLMs on the most well-known model\\nregistry, HF. Our results reveal 148 different naming practices for PTLM\\nreleases, with 40.87% of changes to model weight files not represented in the\\nadopted name-based versioning practice or their documentation. In addition, we\\nidentified that the 52,227 PTLMs are derived from only 299 different base\\nmodels (the modified original models used to create 52,227 PTLMs), with\\nFine-tuning and Quantization being the most prevalent modification methods\\napplied to these base models. Significant gaps in release transparency, in\\nterms of training dataset specifications and model card availability, still\\nexist, highlighting the need for standardized documentation. While we\\nidentified a model naming practice explicitly differentiating between major and\\nminor PTLM releases, we did not find any significant difference in the types of\\nchanges that went into either type of releases, suggesting that major/minor\\nversion numbers for PTLMs often are chosen arbitrarily. Our findings provide\\nvaluable insights to improve PTLM release practices, nudging the field towards\\nmore formal semantic versioning practices.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10472v1) |\\n| Real-Time Whole-Body Control of Legged Robots with Model-Predictive Path\\n  Integral Control | Juan Alvarez-Padilla, John Z.

F. Lizarraga, Flavia M. D. Marquitti, Marcus A. M. de Aguiar |   We investigate the role of assortative mating in speciation using the\\nsympatric model of Derrida and Higgs. The model explores the idea that genetic\\ndifferences create incompatibilities between individuals, preventing mating if\\nthe number of such differences is too large. Speciation, however, only happens\\nin this mating system if the number of genes is large. Here we show that\\nspeciation with small genome sizes can occur if assortative mating is\\nintroduced. In our model individuals are represented by three chromosomes: one\\nresponsible for reproductive compatibility, one for coding the trait on which\\nassortativity will operate, and a neutral chromosome. Reproduction is possible\\nif individuals are genetically similar with respect to the first chromosome,\\nbut among these compatible mating partners, the one with the most similar trait\\ncoded by the second chromosome is selected. We show that this type of\\nassortativity facilitates speciation, which can happen with a small number of\\ngenes in the first chromosome. Species, classified according to reproductive\\nisolation, dictated by the first chromosome, can display different traits\\nvalues, as measured by the second and the third chromosomes. Therefore, species\\ncan also be identified based on similarity of the neutral trait, which works as\\na proxy for reproductive isolation.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10466v1) |\\n| A stabilized total pressure-formulation of the Biot's poroelasticity\\n  equations in frequency domain: numerical analysis and applications | Cristian C\\u00e1rcamo, Alfonso Caiazzo, Felipe Galarce, Joaqu\\u00edn Mura |   This work focuses on the numerical solution of the dynamics of a poroelastic\\nmaterial in the frequency domain.

In\\nthis work we give multiple results related to the property testing of direct\\nsums.\\n  Our first result concerns a test proposed by Dinur and Golubev in 2019.

As an application of our result, we obtain a direct sum test which works\\nin the online adversary model of \\\\cite{KRV}.\\n  Finally, we also discuss a Fourier analytic interpretation of the diamond\\ntester in the $n=2$ case, as well as prove local correction results for direct\\nsum as conjectured by Dinur and Golubev.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10464v1) |\\n| Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks in Low-Data Regimes: A Comparative Study with\\n  Multilayer Perceptrons | Farhad Pourkamali-Anaraki |   Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) have long been a cornerstone in deep learning,\\nknown for their capacity to model complex relationships. Recently,\\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a compelling alternative,\\nutilizing highly flexible learnable activation functions directly on network\\nedges, a departure from the neuron-centric approach of MLPs. However, KANs\\nsignificantly increase the number of learnable parameters, raising concerns\\nabout their effectiveness in data-scarce environments. This paper presents a\\ncomprehensive comparative study of MLPs and KANs from both algorithmic and\\nexperimental perspectives, with a focus on low-data regimes. We introduce an\\neffective technique for designing MLPs with unique, parameterized activation\\nfunctions for each neuron, enabling a more balanced comparison with KANs. Using\\nempirical evaluations on simulated data and two real-world data sets from\\nmedicine and engineering, we explore the trade-offs between model complexity\\nand accuracy, with particular attention to the role of network depth. Our\\nfindings show that MLPs with individualized activation functions achieve\\nsignificantly higher predictive accuracy with only a modest increase in\\nparameters, especially when the sample size is limited to around one hundred.\\nFor example, in a three-class classification problem within additive\\nmanufacturing, MLPs achieve a median accuracy of 0.91, significantly\\noutperforming KANs, which only reach a median accuracy of 0.53 with default\\nhyperparameters. These results offer valuable insights into the impact of\\nactivation function selection in neural networks.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10463v1) |\\n| Effects of synapse location, delay and background stochastic activity on\\n  synchronising hippocampal CA1 neurons | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore |   We study the synchronisation of neurons in a realistic model under the\\nHodgkin-Huxley dynamics. To focus on the role of the different locations of the\\nexcitatory synapses, we use two identical neurons where the set of input\\nsignals is grouped at two different distances from the soma. The system is\\nintended to represent a CA1 hippocampal neuron in which the synapses arriving\\nfrom the CA3 neurons of the trisynaptic pathway appear to be localised in the\\napical dendritic region and are, in principle, either proximal or distal to the\\nsoma. Synchronisation is studied using a specifically defined spiking\\ncorrelation function as a function of various parameters such as the distance\\nfrom the soma of one of the synaptic groups, the inhibition weight and the\\nassociated activation delay. We found that the neurons' spiking activity\\ndepends nonmonotonically on the relative dendritic location of the synapses and\\ntheir inhibitory weight, whereas the synchronisation measure always decreases\\nwith inhibition, and strongly depends on its activation time delay. The\\nbackground activity on the somas results essentially independent on the\\nfluctuation intensity and strongly support the importance of the balance\\nbetween inhibition and excitation for neuronal synchronization.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10460v1) |\\n| Efficiently Crowdsourcing Visual Importance with Punch-Hole Annotation | Minsuk Chang, Soohyun Lee, Aeri Cho, Hyeon Jeon, Seokhyeon Park, Cindy Xiong Bearfield, Jinwook Seo |   We introduce a novel crowdsourcing method for identifying important areas in\\ngraphical images through punch-hole labeling. Traditional methods, such as gaze\\ntrackers and mouse-based annotations, which generate continuous data, can be\\nimpractical in crowdsourcing scenarios. They require many participants, and the\\noutcome data can be noisy. In contrast, our method first segments the graphical\\nimage with a grid and drops a portion of the patches (punch holes). Then, we\\niteratively ask the labeler to validate each annotation with holes, narrowing\\ndown the annotation only having the most important area. This approach aims to\\nreduce annotation noise in crowdsourcing by standardizing the annotations while\\nenhancing labeling efficiency and reliability. Preliminary findings from\\nfundamental charts demonstrate that punch-hole labeling can effectively\\npinpoint critical regions. This also highlights its potential for broader\\napplication in visualization research, particularly in studying large-scale\\nusers' graphical perception.

Chodas |   This work is dedicated to debias the Near-Earth Objects (NEO) population\\nbased on observations from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System\\n(ATLAS) telescopes. We have applied similar methods used to develop the\\nrecently released NEO model generator (NEOMOD), once debiasing the NEO\\npopulation using data from Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) G96 telescope. ATLAS is\\ncomposed of four different telescopes. We first analyzed observational data\\nfrom each of all four telescopes separately and later combined them. Our\\nresults highlight main differences between CSS and ATLAS, e.g., sky coverage\\nand survey power at debiasing the NEO population. ATLAS has a much larger sky\\ncoverage than CSS, allowing it to find bright NEOs that would be constantly\\n\\\"hiding\\\" from CSS. Consequently, ATLAS is more powerful than CSS at debiasing\\nthe NEO population for H $\\\\lesssim$ 19. With its intrinsically greater\\nsensitivity and emphasis on observing near opposition, CSS excels in the\\ndebiasing of smaller objects. ATLAS, as an all sky survey designed to find\\nimminent hazardous objects, necessarily spends a significant fraction of time\\nlooking at places on the sky where objects do not appear, reducing its power\\nfor debiasing the population of small objects.

Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited\\nfocus on developing and evaluating explainable neural-based graph generative\\nmodels specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we\\npropose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE\\nextracts node-level representations that express node memberships over distinct\\nextreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is\\nachieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its\\npolarization.

It is\\na challenging problem due to the intricate characteristics of insects. In this\\npaper, we present DeWi, novel learning assistance for insect pest\\nclassification. With a one-stage and alternating training strategy, DeWi\\nsimultaneously improves several Convolutional Neural Networks in two\\nperspectives: discrimination (by optimizing a triplet margin loss in a\\nsupervised training manner) and generalization (via data augmentation). From\\nthat, DeWi can learn discriminative and in-depth features of insect pests\\n(deep) yet still generalize well to a large number of insect categories (wide).\\nExperimental results show that DeWi achieves the highest performances on two\\ninsect pest classification benchmarks (76.44\\\\% accuracy on the IP102 dataset\\nand 99.79\\\\% accuracy on the D0 dataset, respectively). In addition, extensive\\nevaluations and ablation studies are conducted to thoroughly investigate our\\nDeWi and demonstrate its superiority.

Behavior trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robot\\ntask planning for their modularity and flexibility, but manually designing them\\ncan be effort-intensive. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been\\napplied in robotic task planning for generating action sequences, but their\\nability to generate BTs has not been fully investigated. To this end, We\\npropose LLM as BT-planner, a novel framework to leverage LLMs for BT generation\\nin robotic assembly task planning and execution. Four in-context learning\\nmethods are introduced to utilize the natural language processing and inference\\ncapabilities of LLMs to produce task plans in BT format, reducing manual effort\\nand ensuring robustness and comprehensibility. We also evaluate the performance\\nof fine-tuned, fewer-parameter LLMs on the same tasks. Experiments in simulated\\nand real-world settings show that our framework enhances LLMs' performance in\\nBT generation, improving success rates in BT generation through in-context\\nlearning and supervised fine-tuning.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10444v1) |\\n| The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration.

Aguilar, Ralph Bohlin, Misty Cracraft, Marjorie Decleir, Andras Gaspar, David R. Law, Alberto Noriega-Crespo, Michael Regan |   The absolute flux calibration of the Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and\\nCoronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first\\n2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the\\nflux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays,\\nand different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining\\nobserved aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions\\nbased on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of\\nthese observations were combined with model point-spread-functions to measure\\nthe corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with\\ntime, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time,\\nrate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations\\nwere with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately\\nevery month revealed a modest time-dependent response loss seen mainly at the\\nlongest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential\\nwith a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the\\nband-dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was\\nfound to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different\\nsubarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting\\nfor the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors\\nmeasured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The\\nformal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are\\n0.3 to 1.0%, with longer-wavelength bands generally having larger\\nuncertainties.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10443v1) |\\n| CtRNet-X: Camera-to-Robot Pose Estimation in Real-world Conditions Using\\n  a Single Camera | Jingpei Lu, Zekai Liang, Tristin Xie, Florian Ritcher, Shan Lin, Sainan Liu, Michael C. Yip |   Camera-to-robot calibration is crucial for vision-based robot control and\\nrequires effort to make it accurate. Recent advancements in markerless pose\\nestimation methods have eliminated the need for time-consuming physical setups\\nfor camera-to-robot calibration. While the existing markerless pose estimation\\nmethods have demonstrated impressive accuracy without the need for cumbersome\\nsetups, they rely on the assumption that all the robot joints are visible\\nwithin the camera's field of view. However, in practice, robots usually move in\\nand out of view, and some portion of the robot may stay out-of-frame during the\\nwhole manipulation task due to real-world constraints, leading to a lack of\\nsufficient visual features and subsequent failure of these approaches. To\\naddress this challenge and enhance the applicability to vision-based robot\\ncontrol, we propose a novel framework capable of estimating the robot pose with\\npartially visible robot manipulators. Our approach leverages the\\nVision-Language Models for fine-grained robot components detection, and\\nintegrates it into a keypoint-based pose estimation network, which enables more\\nrobust performance in varied operational conditions. The framework is evaluated\\non both public robot datasets and self-collected partial-view datasets to\\ndemonstrate our robustness and generalizability. As a result, this method is\\neffective for robot pose estimation in a wider range of real-world manipulation\\nscenarios.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10441v1) |\\n| Successive topological phase transitions in two distinct spin-flop\\n  phases on the honeycomb lattice | Xudong Li, Jize Zhao, Jinbin Li, Qiang Luo |   The Kitaev magnets with bond-dependent interactions have garnered\\nconsiderable attention in recent years for their ability to harbor exotic\\nphases and nontrivial excitations. The topological magnons, which are indicated\\nby nonzero Chern number and thermal Hall conductivity, are proposed to\\npartially explain thermal Hall measurements in real materials. Hitherto,\\ntopological magnons have been extensively explored when the magnetic field is\\nnormal to the honeycomb plane, but their topological characteristics are less\\nstudied in the presence of in-plane magnetic field. Here, we study two distinct\\nin-plane field induced spin-flop phases in the $\\\\Gamma$-$\\\\Gamma'$ model, both\\nof which are off-diagonal couplings that have intimate relation to the Kitaev\\ninteraction. The two spin-flop phases are distinguished by their out-of-plane\\nspin components which can be either antiparallel or parallel, thus dubbing\\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) spin-flop phases, respectively.\\nWe map out topological phase diagrams for both phases, revealing a rich pattern\\nof the Chern number over exchange parameters and magnetic field. We\\nanalytically calculate the boundaries of topological phase transitions when the\\nmagnetic field is along the $a$ and $b$ directions. We find that the thermal\\nHall conductivity and its derivative display contrasting behaviors when\\ncrossing different topological phase transitions. The striking difference of\\nthe two phases lies in that when the magnetic field is along the $b$ direction,\\ntopological magnons are totally absent in the AFM spin-flop phase, while they\\ncan survive in the FM analogue in certain parameter regions.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10439v1) |\\n| A functorial approach to $n$-abelian categories | Vitor Gulisz |   We develop a functorial approach to the study of $n$-abelian categories by\\nreformulating their axioms in terms of their categories of finitely presented\\nfunctors.

The vast majority of\\nenergy-preserving reduced-order methods use symplectic Galerkin projection to\\nconstruct reduced-order Hamiltonian models by projecting the full models onto a\\nsymplectic subspace. However, symplectic projection requires the existence of\\nfully discrete operators, and in many cases, such as black-box PDE solvers,\\nthese operators are inaccessible. In this work, we propose an energy-preserving\\nmachine learning method that can infer the dynamics of the given PDE using data\\nonly, so that the proposed framework does not depend on the fully discrete\\noperators. In this context, the proposed method is non-intrusive. The proposed\\nmethod is grey box in the sense that it requires only some basic knowledge of\\nthe multi-symplectic model at the partial differential equation level. We prove\\nthat the proposed method satisfies spatially discrete local energy conservation\\nand preserves the multi-symplectic conservation laws. We test our method on the\\nlinear wave equation, the Korteweg-de Vries equation, and the\\nZakharov-Kuznetsov equation.

Papoutsis, I. E. Papadakis, C. Panagiotou, M. Dov\\u010diak, E. Kammoun |   Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to be variable across all\\nwavelengths. Significant observational efforts have been invested in the last\\ndecade in studying their ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability. Long and\\ndensely sampled, multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns of numerous Seyfert\\ngalaxies have been conducted with the aim of determining the X-ray/UV/optical\\ncontinuum time lags. Time-lag studies can be used to constrain theoretical\\nmodels. The observed time lags can be explained by thermal reprocessing of the\\nX-rays illuminating the accretion disc (known as the X-ray reverberation\\nmodel). However, the observed light curves contain more information that can be\\nused to further constrain physical models. Our primary objective is to\\ninvestigate whether, in addition to time lags, the X-ray reverberation model\\ncan also explain the UV/optical variability amplitude of nearby Seyferts. To do\\nthis, we measured the excess variance of four sources (namely Mrk 509, NGC\\n4151, NGC 2617, and Mrk 142) as a function of wavelength using data from\\narchival long, multi-wavelength campaigns with Swift, and ground-based\\ntelescopes.

We tested the validity of the\\nmodel by comparing the measured and model variances for a range of accretion\\nrates and X-ray source heights. We conclude that the X-ray thermal\\nreverberation model can fit both the continuum, UV/optical time lags, as well\\nas the variance in these AGNs, for the same physical parameters. Our results\\nsuggest that the accretion disc is constant and that all the observed\\nUV/optical variations, on timescales of days and up to a few weeks, can be\\nfully explained by the variable X-rays as they illuminate the accretion disc.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10417v1) |\\n| Local central limit theorem for Mallows measure | Alexey Bufetov, Kailun Chen |   We study the statistics of the Mallows measure on permutations in the limit\\npioneered by Starr (2009).

In this work,\\nwe show that the SALT equations can arise from the decomposition of the fluid\\nflow map into its mean and fluctuating components. The fluctuating component is\\nrealised as a prescribed stochastic diffeomorphism that introduces stochastic\\ntransport into the system and we construct it using homogenisation theory. The\\ndynamics of the mean component are derived from a variational principle\\nutilising particular forms of variations that preserve the composite structure\\nof the flow. Using a new variational principle, we show that SALT equations can\\narise from random Lagrangians and are equivalent to random coefficient PDEs. We\\nalso demonstrate how to modify the composite flow and the associated\\nvariational principle to derive models inspired by the Lagrangian Averaged\\nEuler-Poincare (LAEP) theory.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10408v1) |\\n| Bitcoin Transaction Behavior Modeling Based on Balance Data | Yu Zhang, Claudio Tessone |   When analyzing Bitcoin users' balance distribution, we observed that it\\nfollows a log-normal pattern. Drawing parallels from the successful application\\nof Gibrat's law of proportional growth in explaining city size and word\\nfrequency distributions, we tested whether the same principle could account for\\nthe log-normal distribution in Bitcoin balances. However, our calculations\\nrevealed that the exponent parameters in both the drift and variance terms\\ndeviate slightly from one. This suggests that Gibrat's proportional growth rule\\nalone does not fully explain the log-normal distribution observed in Bitcoin\\nusers' balances. During our exploration, we discovered an intriguing\\nphenomenon: Bitcoin users tend to fall into two distinct categories based on\\ntheir behavior, which we refer to as ``poor\\\" and ``wealthy\\\" users. Poor users,\\nwho initially purchase only a small amount of Bitcoin, tend to buy more\\nbitcoins first and then sell out all their holdings gradually over time. The\\ncertainty of selling all their coins is higher and higher with time. In\\ncontrast, wealthy users, who acquire a large amount of Bitcoin from the start,\\ntend to sell off their holdings over time. The speed at which they sell their\\nbitcoins is lower and lower over time and they will hold at least a small part\\nof their initial holdings at last. Interestingly, the wealthier the user, the\\nlarger the proportion of their balance and the higher the certainty they tend\\nto sell. This research provided an interesting perspective to explore bitcoin\\nusers' behaviors which may apply to other finance markets.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10407v1) |\\n| Stochastic Data-Driven Predictive Control: Chance-Constraint\\n  Satisfaction with Identified Multi-step Predictors | Haldun Balim, Andrea Carron, Melanie N.

In meiosis II mouse oocytes (developing egg cells) awaiting\\nfertilisation, the spindle, which is the protein structure responsible for\\ndividing genetic material in a cell, must maintain its position near the cell\\ncortex (the thin actin network bound to the cell membrane) for many hours.\\nHowever, the cytoplasmic streaming that accompanies this stable positioning\\nwould intuitively appear to destabilise the spindle position. Here, through a\\ncombination of numerical and analytical modelling, we reveal a new,\\nhydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning beneath the cortical cap.\\nWe show that this stability depends critically on the spindle size and the\\nactive driving from the cortex, and demonstrate that stable spindle positioning\\ncan result purely from a hydrodynamic suction force exerted on the spindle by\\nthe cytoplasmic flow.

Since it offers a well-motivated starting point for\\nthe study of physics at very high energies, we incorporate an $R^2$ term in the\\nPalatini gravity. In addition, afterward the inflation, the inflaton oscillates\\nabout the minimum of the inflation potential, and reheats the universe.

The majority of work that has been\\ndone is focused on Deep Learning (DL) based approaches. However, with the\\nemergence of new algorithms such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm, there\\nis growing interest in exploring alternative approaches that may offer unique\\nadvantages in certain domains or applications. One of these domains is\\nFederated Learning (FL), in which users privacy is of utmost importance. Due to\\nits novelty, FL has seen a surge in the incorporation of personalization\\ntechniques to enhance model accuracy while maintaining user privacy under\\npersonalized conditions. In this work, we propose a novel approach dubbed TPFL:\\nTsetlin-Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into\\nclusters based on their confidence towards a specific class. In this way,\\nclustering can benefit from two key advantages. Firstly, clients share only\\nwhat they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight\\naggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been\\nenough during the training. This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are\\nnon-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID). Secondly, by sharing\\nonly weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially\\nreduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication\\ncost.

However,\\nsuch fixed feature encoders tend to be class-agnostic, inevitably activating\\nobjects that are irrelevant to the target class. In contrast, humans can\\neffortlessly focus on specific objects in the line of sight. This paper mimics\\nthe visual perception pattern of human beings and proposes a novel and powerful\\nprompt-driven scheme, called ``Prompt and Transfer\\\" (PAT), which constructs a\\ndynamic class-aware prompting paradigm to tune the encoder for focusing on the\\ninterested object (target class) in the current task. Three key points are\\nelaborated to enhance the prompting: 1) Cross-modal linguistic information is\\nintroduced to initialize prompts for each task. 2) Semantic Prompt Transfer\\n(SPT) that precisely transfers the class-specific semantics within the images\\nto prompts. 3) Part Mask Generator (PMG) that works in conjunction with SPT to\\nadaptively generate different but complementary part prompts for different\\nindividuals.

However, this introduces\\nthe complexities of numerical derivatives into the training process of these\\nmodels. In this study, we propose modifying the structure of the traditional\\nRNN to enable the prediction of each block over a time interval, making it\\npossible to calculate the derivative of the output with respect to time using\\nthe backpropagation algorithm.

Most of the state-of-the-art architectures\\nuse transformers or diffusion-based models to perform this task, despite the\\nheavy computational burden that they require.

Maiti |   We present a comprehensive study on enhancing the thermoelectric (TE)\\nperformance of bilayer graphene (BLG) through irradiation with arbitrarily\\npolarized light, focusing on $AA$- and $AB$-stacked configurations with zigzag\\nedges. Utilizing a combination of tight-binding theory and density functional\\ntheory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on\\nelectronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the\\nelectronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function,\\nwhich significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the\\noverall {\\\\it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT\\ncalculations reveal that $AB$-stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal\\nconductivity compared to $AA$-stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic\\nscattering and phonon group velocity.

This study introduces\\na novel statistical approach, TAR4C, to dissect causal interactions in\\nmultichannel EEG recordings. TAR4C uses the threshold autoregressive model to\\ndescribe the causal interaction between nodes or clusters of nodes in a brain\\nnetwork. The perspective involves testing whether one node, which may represent\\na brain region, can control the dynamics of the other. The node that has such\\nan impact on the other is called a threshold variable and can be classified as\\na causative because its functionality is the leading source operating as an\\ninstantaneous switching mechanism that regulates the time-varying\\nautoregressive structure of the other. This statistical concept is commonly\\nreferred to as threshold non-linearity. Once threshold non-linearity has been\\nverified between a pair of nodes, the subsequent essential facet of TAR\\nmodeling is to assess the predictive ability of the causal node for the current\\nactivity on the other and represent causal interactions in autoregressive\\nterms. This predictive ability is what underlies Granger causality. The TAR4C\\napproach can discover non-linear and time-dependent causal interactions without\\nnegating the G-causality perspective. The efficacy of the proposed approach is\\nexemplified by analyzing the EEG signals recorded during the motor\\nmovement/imagery experiment. The similarities and differences between the\\ncausal interactions manifesting during the execution and the imagery of a given\\nmotor movement are demonstrated by analyzing EEG recordings from multiple\\nsubjects.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10374v1) |\\n| Instigating Cooperation among LLM Agents Using Adaptive Information\\n  Modulation | Qiliang Chen,  Alireza,  Ilami, Nunzio Lore, Babak Heydari |   This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for\\nhuman strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these\\nagents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments.

Their widespread\\nindustrial use and resistance to degradation have led to global environmental\\ncontamination and significant health concerns. While a minority of PFAS have\\nbeen extensively studied, the toxicity of many PFAS remains poorly understood\\ndue to limited direct toxicological data. This study advances the predictive\\nmodeling of PFAS toxicity by combining semi-supervised graph convolutional\\nnetworks (GCNs) with molecular descriptors and fingerprints. We propose a novel\\napproach to enhance the prediction of PFAS binding affinities by isolating\\nmolecular fingerprints to construct graphs where then descriptors are set as\\nthe node features. This approach specifically captures the structural,\\nphysicochemical, and topological features of PFAS without overfitting due to an\\nabundance of features. Unsupervised clustering then identifies representative\\ncompounds for detailed binding studies.

To meet\\nperformance constraints, state-of-the-art control methods such as Incremental\\nNonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) or other adaptive control techniques require\\nhigh control gains to mitigate the effects of uncertainty entering the system.\\nWhile achieving good tracking performance, IDNI requires excessive control\\neffort, results in high actuator strain, and reduced flight smoothness due to\\nconstant and aggressive corrective actions commanded by the controller.

However, the quadratic time complexity of attention\\noperation poses a significant challenge for scaling to longer contexts due to\\nthe extremely high inference latency and GPU memory consumption for caching\\nkey-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free\\napproach to accelerate attention computation. To leverage the dynamic sparse\\nproperty of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor\\nsearch (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most\\nrelevant ones via vector search during generation. Due to the\\nout-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors, off-the-shelf\\nANNS indexes still need to scan O(N) (usually 30% of all keys) data for\\naccurate retrieval, which fails to exploit the high sparsity.\\nRetrievalAttention first identifies the OOD challenge of ANNS-based attention,\\nand addresses it via an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt\\nto queries and only access 1--3% of data, thus achieving a sub-linear time\\ncomplexity. RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of\\nlong-context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the\\nmodel accuracy. Especially, RetrievalAttention only needs 16GB GPU memory for\\nserving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating\\none token in 0.188 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB).\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516v1) |\\n| An Efficient Self-Learning Framework For Interactive Spoken Dialog\\n  Systems | Hitesh Tulsiani, David M.

However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning\\ncapabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this\\nwork, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as\\nsolving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to\\nsearch over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then\\napply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the\\napplication of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in\\na cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell.

This paper investigates the effectiveness of Large Language\\nModels (LLMs) in identifying vulnerabilities within codebases, with a focus on\\nthe latest advancements in LLM technology. Through a comparative analysis, we\\nassess the performance of emerging LLMs, specifically Llama, CodeLlama, Gemma,\\nand CodeGemma, alongside established state-of-the-art models such as BERT,\\nRoBERTa, and GPT-3. Our study aims to shed light on the capabilities of LLMs in\\nvulnerability detection, contributing to the enhancement of software security\\npractices across diverse open-source repositories. We observe that CodeGemma\\nachieves the highest F1-score of 58\\\\ and a Recall of 87\\\\, amongst the recent\\nadditions of large language models to detect software security vulnerabilities.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10490v1) |\\n| Flash STU: Fast Spectral Transform Units | Y.

Our paper aims to investigate if VLMs\\npre-trained on web-scale data learn to encode object states, which can be\\nextracted with zero-shot text prompts. We curate an object state recognition\\ndataset ChangeIt-Frames, and evaluate nine open-source VLMs, including models\\ntrained with contrastive and generative objectives. We observe that while these\\nstate-of-the-art vision-language models can reliably perform object\\nrecognition, they consistently fail to accurately distinguish the objects'\\nphysical states. Through extensive experiments, we identify three areas for\\nimprovements for VLMs to better encode object states, namely the quality of\\nobject localization, the architecture to bind concepts to objects, and the\\nobjective to learn discriminative visual and language encoders on object\\nstates. Data and code are released.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10488v1) |\\n| A Host Galaxy Morphology Link Between Quasi-Periodic Eruptions and Tidal\\n  Disruption Events | Olivier Gilbert, John J. Ruan, Michael Eracleous, Daryl Haggard, Jessie C. Runnoe |   The physical processes that produce X-ray Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs)\\nrecently discovered from the nuclei of several low-redshift galaxies are\\nmysterious. Several pieces of observational evidence strongly suggest a link\\nbetween QPEs and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE). Previous studies also reveal\\nthat the morphologies of TDE host galaxies are highly concentrated, with high\\nSersic indicies, bulge-to-total light (B/T) ratios, and stellar surface mass\\ndensities relative to the broader galaxy population. We use these distinctive\\nproperties to test the link between QPEs and TDEs, by comparing these\\nparameters of QPE host galaxies to TDE host galaxies. We employ archival Legacy\\nSurvey images of a sample of 9 QPE host galaxies and a sample of 13 TDE host\\ngalaxies, and model their surface brightness profiles. We show that QPE host\\ngalaxies have high Sersic indices of ~3, high B/T ratios of ~0.5, and high\\nsurface mass densities of ~10^10 Msun kpc^-2. These properties are similar to\\nTDE host galaxies, but are in strong contrast to a mass- and redshift-matched\\ncontrol sample of galaxies. We also find tentative evidence that the central\\nblack holes in both QPE and TDE host galaxies are undermassive relative to\\ntheir stellar mass. The morphological similarities between QPE and TDE host\\ngalaxies at the population level add to the mounting evidence of a physical\\nlink between these phenomena, and favor QPE models that also invoke TDEs.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10486v1) |\\n| Tuning the Rate of Tightly Packed Systems To Produce Planet Occurrence\\n  Trends with Galactic Height | Sarah Ballard |   The formation of planetary systems has historically been considered in\\nisolation, decoupled from processes on galactic scales. Recent findings\\nemploying data from ESA's Gaia mission challenge this narrative, identifying\\ntrends in planet occurrence with galactic kinematics and stellar age. The\\nfindings indicate changes in planet occurrence over and above the predicted\\nchanges from metallicity variation within the Milky Way, so that changes to\\nstellar metallicity alone (long understood to be deterministic in planet\\noutcomes) cannot explain the trends entirely. The scope of potential factors\\ninfluencing planet formation has grown progressively wider, with accompanying\\ntheoretical support for galactic-scale influences upon planet formation. In\\nthis manuscript, we investigate specifically how changes to the rate of Systems\\nof Tightly-packed Inner Planets (STIPs) could manifest as a trend in planet\\noccurrence with galactic height. We focus our study upon M dwarf planetary\\nsystems for two reasons: first, they host STIPs at high rates, and secondly,\\ntheir longevity makes them useful probes for kinematic trends over Gyr. We\\nconsider two models for a varying STIP rate: one in which STIP likelihood is\\ndetermined by stellar age alone, irrespective of galactic time, and another in\\nwhich the STIP likelihood suddenly increased in recent galactic history. Both\\nmodels, which impose a higher STIP likelihood among younger stars, produce a\\nnegative gradient in planet occurrence with increasing height from the galactic\\nmidplane. We find that a step function model in which STIP likelihood increased\\nby a factor of several ~a few Gyr ago resembles an observed trend among FGK\\ndwarfs. We consider plausible physical mechanisms that could mimic the\\nhypothesized model, given known links between STIP occurrence and other stellar\\nand planetary properties.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10485v1) |\\n| XLM for Autonomous Driving Systems: A Comprehensive Review | Sonda Fourati, Wael Jaafar, Noura Baccar, Safwan Alfattani |   Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable proficiency in various\\ninformation-processing tasks. These tasks span from extracting data and\\nsummarizing literature to generating content, predictive modeling,\\ndecision-making, and system controls. Moreover, Vision Large Models (VLMs) and\\nMultimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which represent the next generation of language\\nmodels, a.k.a., XLMs, can combine and integrate many data modalities with the\\nstrength of language understanding, thus advancing several information-based\\nsystems, such as Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS).

Fay, Nicolas Ferr\\u00e9, Miquel Huix-Rotllant |   Electronic polarization and dispersion are decisive actors in determining\\ninteraction energies between molecules. These interactions have a particularly\\nprofound effect on excitation energies of molecules in complex environments,\\nespecially when the excitation involves a significant degree of charge\\nreorganisation. The direct reaction field (DRF) approach, which has seen a\\nrecent revival of interest, provides a powerful framework for describing these\\ninteractions in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models of\\nsystems, where a small subsystem of interest is described using quantum\\nchemical methods and the remainder is treated with a simple MM force field. In\\nthis paper we show how the DRF approach can be combined with the electrostatic\\npotential fitted (ESPF) multipole operator description of the QM region charge\\ndensity, which reduces the scaling $\\\\mathcal{O}(N_\\\\mathrm{MM}^3)$ of the method\\nwith MM system to $\\\\mathcal{O}(N_\\\\mathrm{MM}^2)$. We also show how the DRF\\napproach can be combined with fluctuating charge descriptions of the\\npolarizable environment, as well as previously used atom-centred\\ndipole-polarizability based models. We further show that the ESPF-DRF method\\nprovides an accurate description of molecular interactions in both ground and\\nexcited electronic states of the QM system and apply it to predict the gas to\\naqueous solution solvatochromic shifts in the UV/visible absorption spectrum of\\nacrolein.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10483v1) |\\n| Schrodinger's Memory: Large Language Models | Wei Wang, Qing Li |   Memory is the foundation of LLMs' functionality, yet past research has lacked\\nan in-depth exploration of their memory capabilities and underlying theory.

Given that perfect model alignment with reality is\\noften unrealistic in practice, we focus on scenarios where the chosen\\nhypothesis set is misspecified. In this context, it remains unclear whether\\ncurrent contextual optimization approaches can effectively address such model\\nmisspecification. In this paper, we present a novel integrated learning and\\noptimization approach designed to tackle model misspecification in contextual\\noptimization. This approach offers theoretical generalizability, tractability,\\nand optimality guarantees, along with strong practical performance. Our method\\ninvolves minimizing a tractable surrogate loss that aligns with the performance\\nvalue from cost vector predictions, regardless of whether the model\\nmisspecified or not, and can be optimized in reasonable time.

One of the classical and popular approaches is Local\\nStochastic Gradient Descent (Local SGD), characterized by multiple local\\nupdates before averaging, which is particularly useful in distributed\\nenvironments to reduce communication bottlenecks and improve scalability. A\\ntypical feature of this method is the dependence on the frequency of\\ncommunications. But in the case of a quadratic target function with homogeneous\\ndata distribution over all devices, the influence of frequency of\\ncommunications vanishes. As a natural consequence, subsequent studies include\\nthe assumption of a Lipschitz Hessian, as this indicates the similarity of the\\noptimized function to a quadratic one to some extent. However, in order to\\nextend the completeness of the Local SGD theory and unlock its potential, in\\nthis paper we abandon the Lipschitz Hessian assumption by introducing a new\\nconcept of $\\\\textit{approximate quadraticity}$. This assumption gives a new\\nperspective on problems that have near quadratic properties. In addition,\\nexisting theoretical analyses of Local SGD often assume bounded variance. We,\\nin turn, consider the unbounded noise condition, which allows us to broaden the\\nclass of studied problems.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10478v1) |\\n| SimInversion: A Simple Framework for Inversion-Based Text-to-Image\\n  Editing | Qi Qian, Haiyang Xu, Ming Yan, Juhua Hu |   Diffusion models demonstrate impressive image generation performance with\\ntext guidance. Inspired by the learning process of diffusion, existing images\\ncan be edited according to text by DDIM inversion. However, the vanilla DDIM\\ninversion is not optimized for classifier-free guidance and the accumulated\\nerror will result in the undesired performance. While many algorithms are\\ndeveloped to improve the framework of DDIM inversion for editing, in this work,\\nwe investigate the approximation error in DDIM inversion and propose to\\ndisentangle the guidance scale for the source and target branches to reduce the\\nerror while keeping the original framework. Moreover, a better guidance scale\\n(i.e., 0.5) than default settings can be derived theoretically.

However, previous works either rely on contrastive learning that\\nsuffers false negative problems or are based on reconstruction that learns too\\nmuch unessential low-level clues, leading to limited representations for\\ndownstream tasks. Recently, great advances have been made in generative\\nlearning, which is naturally a challenging yet meaningful pretext task to model\\nthe general underlying data distributions. However, the representation learning\\ncapacity of generative models is under-explored, especially for the skeletons\\nwith spacial sparsity and temporal redundancy. To this end, we propose Masked\\nConditional Diffusion (MacDiff) as a unified framework for human skeleton\\nmodeling. For the first time, we leverage diffusion models as effective\\nskeleton representation learners. Specifically, we train a diffusion decoder\\nconditioned on the representations extracted by a semantic encoder. Random\\nmasking is applied to encoder inputs to introduce a information bottleneck and\\nremove redundancy of skeletons. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that\\nour generative objective involves the contrastive learning objective which\\naligns the masked and noisy views. Meanwhile, it also enforces the\\nrepresentation to complement for the noisy view, leading to better\\ngeneralization performance. MacDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on\\nrepresentation learning benchmarks while maintaining the competence for\\ngenerative tasks. Moreover, we leverage the diffusion model for data\\naugmentation, significantly enhancing the fine-tuning performance in scenarios\\nwith scarce labeled data.

Hassan |   The proliferation of open Pre-trained Language Models (PTLMs) on model\\nregistry platforms like Hugging Face (HF) presents both opportunities and\\nchallenges for companies building products around them. Similar to traditional\\nsoftware dependencies, PTLMs continue to evolve after a release. However, the\\ncurrent state of release practices of PTLMs on model registry platforms are\\nplagued by a variety of inconsistencies, such as ambiguous naming conventions\\nand inaccessible model training documentation. Given the knowledge gap on\\ncurrent PTLM release practices, our empirical study uses a mixed-methods\\napproach to analyze the releases of 52,227 PTLMs on the most well-known model\\nregistry, HF. Our results reveal 148 different naming practices for PTLM\\nreleases, with 40.87% of changes to model weight files not represented in the\\nadopted name-based versioning practice or their documentation. In addition, we\\nidentified that the 52,227 PTLMs are derived from only 299 different base\\nmodels (the modified original models used to create 52,227 PTLMs), with\\nFine-tuning and Quantization being the most prevalent modification methods\\napplied to these base models. Significant gaps in release transparency, in\\nterms of training dataset specifications and model card availability, still\\nexist, highlighting the need for standardized documentation. While we\\nidentified a model naming practice explicitly differentiating between major and\\nminor PTLM releases, we did not find any significant difference in the types of\\nchanges that went into either type of releases, suggesting that major/minor\\nversion numbers for PTLMs often are chosen arbitrarily. Our findings provide\\nvaluable insights to improve PTLM release practices, nudging the field towards\\nmore formal semantic versioning practices.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10472v1) |\\n| Real-Time Whole-Body Control of Legged Robots with Model-Predictive Path\\n  Integral Control | Juan Alvarez-Padilla, John Z.

F. Lizarraga, Flavia M. D. Marquitti, Marcus A. M. de Aguiar |   We investigate the role of assortative mating in speciation using the\\nsympatric model of Derrida and Higgs. The model explores the idea that genetic\\ndifferences create incompatibilities between individuals, preventing mating if\\nthe number of such differences is too large. Speciation, however, only happens\\nin this mating system if the number of genes is large. Here we show that\\nspeciation with small genome sizes can occur if assortative mating is\\nintroduced. In our model individuals are represented by three chromosomes: one\\nresponsible for reproductive compatibility, one for coding the trait on which\\nassortativity will operate, and a neutral chromosome. Reproduction is possible\\nif individuals are genetically similar with respect to the first chromosome,\\nbut among these compatible mating partners, the one with the most similar trait\\ncoded by the second chromosome is selected. We show that this type of\\nassortativity facilitates speciation, which can happen with a small number of\\ngenes in the first chromosome. Species, classified according to reproductive\\nisolation, dictated by the first chromosome, can display different traits\\nvalues, as measured by the second and the third chromosomes. Therefore, species\\ncan also be identified based on similarity of the neutral trait, which works as\\na proxy for reproductive isolation.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10466v1) |\\n| A stabilized total pressure-formulation of the Biot's poroelasticity\\n  equations in frequency domain: numerical analysis and applications | Cristian C\\u00e1rcamo, Alfonso Caiazzo, Felipe Galarce, Joaqu\\u00edn Mura |   This work focuses on the numerical solution of the dynamics of a poroelastic\\nmaterial in the frequency domain.

Recently,\\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a compelling alternative,\\nutilizing highly flexible learnable activation functions directly on network\\nedges, a departure from the neuron-centric approach of MLPs. However, KANs\\nsignificantly increase the number of learnable parameters, raising concerns\\nabout their effectiveness in data-scarce environments. This paper presents a\\ncomprehensive comparative study of MLPs and KANs from both algorithmic and\\nexperimental perspectives, with a focus on low-data regimes. We introduce an\\neffective technique for designing MLPs with unique, parameterized activation\\nfunctions for each neuron, enabling a more balanced comparison with KANs. Using\\nempirical evaluations on simulated data and two real-world data sets from\\nmedicine and engineering, we explore the trade-offs between model complexity\\nand accuracy, with particular attention to the role of network depth.

To focus on the role of the different locations of the\\nexcitatory synapses, we use two identical neurons where the set of input\\nsignals is grouped at two different distances from the soma. The system is\\nintended to represent a CA1 hippocampal neuron in which the synapses arriving\\nfrom the CA3 neurons of the trisynaptic pathway appear to be localised in the\\napical dendritic region and are, in principle, either proximal or distal to the\\nsoma. Synchronisation is studied using a specifically defined spiking\\ncorrelation function as a function of various parameters such as the distance\\nfrom the soma of one of the synaptic groups, the inhibition weight and the\\nassociated activation delay. We found that the neurons' spiking activity\\ndepends nonmonotonically on the relative dendritic location of the synapses and\\ntheir inhibitory weight, whereas the synchronisation measure always decreases\\nwith inhibition, and strongly depends on its activation time delay. The\\nbackground activity on the somas results essentially independent on the\\nfluctuation intensity and strongly support the importance of the balance\\nbetween inhibition and excitation for neuronal synchronization.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10460v1) |\\n| Efficiently Crowdsourcing Visual Importance with Punch-Hole Annotation | Minsuk Chang, Soohyun Lee, Aeri Cho, Hyeon Jeon, Seokhyeon Park, Cindy Xiong Bearfield, Jinwook Seo |   We introduce a novel crowdsourcing method for identifying important areas in\\ngraphical images through punch-hole labeling. Traditional methods, such as gaze\\ntrackers and mouse-based annotations, which generate continuous data, can be\\nimpractical in crowdsourcing scenarios.

This approach aims to\\nreduce annotation noise in crowdsourcing by standardizing the annotations while\\nenhancing labeling efficiency and reliability. Preliminary findings from\\nfundamental charts demonstrate that punch-hole labeling can effectively\\npinpoint critical regions.

Bottke, Robert Jedicke, Shantanu Naidu, Steven R. Chesley, Davide Farnocchia, Paul W. Chodas |   This work is dedicated to debias the Near-Earth Objects (NEO) population\\nbased on observations from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System\\n(ATLAS) telescopes. We have applied similar methods used to develop the\\nrecently released NEO model generator (NEOMOD), once debiasing the NEO\\npopulation using data from Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) G96 telescope. ATLAS is\\ncomposed of four different telescopes. We first analyzed observational data\\nfrom each of all four telescopes separately and later combined them. Our\\nresults highlight main differences between CSS and ATLAS, e.g., sky coverage\\nand survey power at debiasing the NEO population. ATLAS has a much larger sky\\ncoverage than CSS, allowing it to find bright NEOs that would be constantly\\n\\\"hiding\\\" from CSS. Consequently, ATLAS is more powerful than CSS at debiasing\\nthe NEO population for H $\\\\lesssim$ 19. With its intrinsically greater\\nsensitivity and emphasis on observing near opposition, CSS excels in the\\ndebiasing of smaller objects. ATLAS, as an all sky survey designed to find\\nimminent hazardous objects, necessarily spends a significant fraction of time\\nlooking at places on the sky where objects do not appear, reducing its power\\nfor debiasing the population of small objects. We estimate a NEO population\\ncompleteness of $\\\\approx$ 88%$^{+3\\\\%}_{-2\\\\%}$ for H $<$ 17.75 and $\\\\approx$\\n36%$^{+1\\\\%}_{-1\\\\%}$ for H $<$ 22.25. Those numbers are similar to previous\\nestimates (within error bars for H $<$ 17.75) from CSS, yet, around 3% and 8%\\nsmaller at their face values, respectively. We also confirm previous finding\\nthat the $\\\\nu_6$ secular resonance is the main source of small and faint NEOs\\nat H = 28, whereas the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter dominates for\\nlarger and brighter NEOs at H = 15.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10453v1) |\\n| Signed Graph Autoencoder for Explainable and Polarization-Aware Network\\n  Embeddings | Nikolaos Nakis, Chrysoula Kosma, Giannis Nikolentzos, Michalis Chatzianastasis, Iakovos Evdaimon, Michalis Vazirgiannis |   Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant\\nattention in recent years for their ability to extract informative latent\\nrepresentations, characterizing the structure of complex topologies, such as\\ngraphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited\\nfocus on developing and evaluating explainable neural-based graph generative\\nmodels specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we\\npropose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE\\nextracts node-level representations that express node memberships over distinct\\nextreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is\\nachieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its\\npolarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for\\nanalyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with\\nrelational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation\\ndemonstrates the SGAAEs' capability to successfully infer node memberships over\\nthe different underlying latent structures while extracting competing\\ncommunities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the\\nnetwork. Additionally, we introduce the 2-level network polarization problem\\nand show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model\\nachieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across\\nfour real-world datasets, outperforming several baseline models.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10452v1) |\\n| Why you should also use OLS estimation of tail exponents | Thiago Trafane Oliveira Santos, Daniel Oliveira Cajueiro |   Even though practitioners often estimate Pareto exponents running OLS\\nrank-size regressions, the usual recommendation is to use the Hill MLE with a\\nsmall-sample correction instead, due to its unbiasedness and efficiency.

Aguilar, Ralph Bohlin, Misty Cracraft, Marjorie Decleir, Andras Gaspar, David R. Law, Alberto Noriega-Crespo, Michael Regan |   The absolute flux calibration of the Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and\\nCoronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first\\n2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the\\nflux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays,\\nand different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining\\nobserved aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions\\nbased on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of\\nthese observations were combined with model point-spread-functions to measure\\nthe corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with\\ntime, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time,\\nrate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations\\nwere with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately\\nevery month revealed a modest time-dependent response loss seen mainly at the\\nlongest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential\\nwith a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the\\nband-dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was\\nfound to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different\\nsubarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting\\nfor the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors\\nmeasured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band.

Yip |   Camera-to-robot calibration is crucial for vision-based robot control and\\nrequires effort to make it accurate. Recent advancements in markerless pose\\nestimation methods have eliminated the need for time-consuming physical setups\\nfor camera-to-robot calibration. While the existing markerless pose estimation\\nmethods have demonstrated impressive accuracy without the need for cumbersome\\nsetups, they rely on the assumption that all the robot joints are visible\\nwithin the camera's field of view. However, in practice, robots usually move in\\nand out of view, and some portion of the robot may stay out-of-frame during the\\nwhole manipulation task due to real-world constraints, leading to a lack of\\nsufficient visual features and subsequent failure of these approaches. To\\naddress this challenge and enhance the applicability to vision-based robot\\ncontrol, we propose a novel framework capable of estimating the robot pose with\\npartially visible robot manipulators. Our approach leverages the\\nVision-Language Models for fine-grained robot components detection, and\\nintegrates it into a keypoint-based pose estimation network, which enables more\\nrobust performance in varied operational conditions. The framework is evaluated\\non both public robot datasets and self-collected partial-view datasets to\\ndemonstrate our robustness and generalizability. As a result, this method is\\neffective for robot pose estimation in a wider range of real-world manipulation\\nscenarios.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10441v1) |\\n| Successive topological phase transitions in two distinct spin-flop\\n  phases on the honeycomb lattice | Xudong Li, Jize Zhao, Jinbin Li, Qiang Luo |   The Kitaev magnets with bond-dependent interactions have garnered\\nconsiderable attention in recent years for their ability to harbor exotic\\nphases and nontrivial excitations. The topological magnons, which are indicated\\nby nonzero Chern number and thermal Hall conductivity, are proposed to\\npartially explain thermal Hall measurements in real materials. Hitherto,\\ntopological magnons have been extensively explored when the magnetic field is\\nnormal to the honeycomb plane, but their topological characteristics are less\\nstudied in the presence of in-plane magnetic field. Here, we study two distinct\\nin-plane field induced spin-flop phases in the $\\\\Gamma$-$\\\\Gamma'$ model, both\\nof which are off-diagonal couplings that have intimate relation to the Kitaev\\ninteraction. The two spin-flop phases are distinguished by their out-of-plane\\nspin components which can be either antiparallel or parallel, thus dubbing\\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) spin-flop phases, respectively.\\nWe map out topological phase diagrams for both phases, revealing a rich pattern\\nof the Chern number over exchange parameters and magnetic field. We\\nanalytically calculate the boundaries of topological phase transitions when the\\nmagnetic field is along the $a$ and $b$ directions. We find that the thermal\\nHall conductivity and its derivative display contrasting behaviors when\\ncrossing different topological phase transitions. The striking difference of\\nthe two phases lies in that when the magnetic field is along the $b$ direction,\\ntopological magnons are totally absent in the AFM spin-flop phase, while they\\ncan survive in the FM analogue in certain parameter regions.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10439v1) |\\n| A functorial approach to $n$-abelian categories | Vitor Gulisz |   We develop a functorial approach to the study of $n$-abelian categories by\\nreformulating their axioms in terms of their categories of finitely presented\\nfunctors.

The vast majority of\\nenergy-preserving reduced-order methods use symplectic Galerkin projection to\\nconstruct reduced-order Hamiltonian models by projecting the full models onto a\\nsymplectic subspace.

RGS comprises two steps: visual grounding and grasp pose estimation.\\nRecent studies leverage powerful Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for visually\\ngrounding free-flowing natural language in real-world robotic execution.\\nHowever, comparisons in complex, cluttered environments with multiple instances\\nof the same object are lacking. This paper introduces HiFi-CS, featuring\\nhierarchical application of Featurewise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to fuse image\\nand text embeddings, enhancing visual grounding for complex attribute rich text\\nqueries encountered in robotic grasping. Visual grounding associates an object\\nin 2D/3D space with natural language input and is studied in two scenarios:\\nClosed and Open Vocabulary. HiFi-CS features a lightweight decoder combined\\nwith a frozen VLM and outperforms competitive baselines in closed vocabulary\\nsettings while being 100x smaller in size. Our model can effectively guide\\nopen-set object detectors like GroundedSAM to enhance open-vocabulary\\nperformance. We validate our approach through real-world RGS experiments using\\na 7-DOF robotic arm, achieving 90.33\\\\% visual grounding accuracy in 15 tabletop\\nscenes.

Papoutsis, I. E. Papadakis, C. Panagiotou, M. Dov\\u010diak, E. Kammoun |   Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to be variable across all\\nwavelengths. Significant observational efforts have been invested in the last\\ndecade in studying their ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability. Long and\\ndensely sampled, multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns of numerous Seyfert\\ngalaxies have been conducted with the aim of determining the X-ray/UV/optical\\ncontinuum time lags. Time-lag studies can be used to constrain theoretical\\nmodels. The observed time lags can be explained by thermal reprocessing of the\\nX-rays illuminating the accretion disc (known as the X-ray reverberation\\nmodel). However, the observed light curves contain more information that can be\\nused to further constrain physical models. Our primary objective is to\\ninvestigate whether, in addition to time lags, the X-ray reverberation model\\ncan also explain the UV/optical variability amplitude of nearby Seyferts. To do\\nthis, we measured the excess variance of four sources (namely Mrk 509, NGC\\n4151, NGC 2617, and Mrk 142) as a function of wavelength using data from\\narchival long, multi-wavelength campaigns with Swift, and ground-based\\ntelescopes. We also computed the model excess variance in the case of the X-ray\\nreverberation model by determining the disc's transfer function and assuming a\\nbending power law for the X-ray power spectrum. We tested the validity of the\\nmodel by comparing the measured and model variances for a range of accretion\\nrates and X-ray source heights. We conclude that the X-ray thermal\\nreverberation model can fit both the continuum, UV/optical time lags, as well\\nas the variance in these AGNs, for the same physical parameters. Our results\\nsuggest that the accretion disc is constant and that all the observed\\nUV/optical variations, on timescales of days and up to a few weeks, can be\\nfully explained by the variable X-rays as they illuminate the accretion disc.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10417v1) |\\n| Local central limit theorem for Mallows measure | Alexey Bufetov, Kailun Chen |   We study the statistics of the Mallows measure on permutations in the limit\\npioneered by Starr (2009).

However, this convenience raises substantial concerns about\\nunauthorized access to users' privacy-sensitive information, which could be\\nfurther abused for illegitimate purposes like user tracking or monetization.\\nOur study offers a targeted analysis of user privacy protection among Android\\nthird-party SDKs, filling a critical gap in the Android software supply chain.\\nIt focuses on two aspects of their privacy practices, including data\\nexfiltration and behavior-policy compliance (or privacy compliance), utilizing\\ntechniques of taint analysis and large language models. It covers 158\\nwidely-used SDKs from two key SDK release platforms, the official one and a\\nlarge alternative one. From them, we identified 338 instances of privacy data\\nexfiltration. On the privacy compliance, our study reveals that more than 30%\\nof the examined SDKs fail to provide a privacy policy to disclose their data\\nhandling practices. Among those that provide privacy policies, 37% of them\\nover-collect user data, and 88% falsely claim access to sensitive data. We\\nrevisit the latest versions of the SDKs after 12 months.

As raw traces obscure the true temporal structure of neuron's\\nactivity, we performed a tuned filtering of the calcium concentration using two\\nmethods: a biophysical model and a kernel mapping. The former characterizes\\nspike trains related to a particular triggering event, while the latter filters\\nout the signal and refines the selection of the underlying neuronal response.\\nTransitioning from traditional time series analysis to point process theory,\\nthe study explores spike-time distance metrics and point pattern prototypes to\\ndescribe repeated observations.

In\\nparticular, the study aims to categorize 47 point patterns by depth, assuming\\nthe similarity of spike occurrences within specific depth categories. The\\nresults highlight the pivotal roles of depth and stimuli in discerning diverse\\ntemporal structures of neuron firing events, confirming the point process\\napproach based on prototype analysis is largely useful in the classification of\\nspike traces.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10409v1) |\\n| Variational closures for composite homogenised fluid flows | Theo Diamantakis, Ruiao Hu |   The Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport is a variational formulation of\\nstochastic fluid dynamics introduced to model the effects of unresolved scales,\\nwhilst preserving the geometric structure of ideal fluid flows. In this work,\\nwe show that the SALT equations can arise from the decomposition of the fluid\\nflow map into its mean and fluctuating components.

Drawing parallels from the successful application\\nof Gibrat's law of proportional growth in explaining city size and word\\nfrequency distributions, we tested whether the same principle could account for\\nthe log-normal distribution in Bitcoin balances. However, our calculations\\nrevealed that the exponent parameters in both the drift and variance terms\\ndeviate slightly from one. This suggests that Gibrat's proportional growth rule\\nalone does not fully explain the log-normal distribution observed in Bitcoin\\nusers' balances. During our exploration, we discovered an intriguing\\nphenomenon: Bitcoin users tend to fall into two distinct categories based on\\ntheir behavior, which we refer to as ``poor\\\" and ``wealthy\\\" users. Poor users,\\nwho initially purchase only a small amount of Bitcoin, tend to buy more\\nbitcoins first and then sell out all their holdings gradually over time. The\\ncertainty of selling all their coins is higher and higher with time. In\\ncontrast, wealthy users, who acquire a large amount of Bitcoin from the start,\\ntend to sell off their holdings over time. The speed at which they sell their\\nbitcoins is lower and lower over time and they will hold at least a small part\\nof their initial holdings at last. Interestingly, the wealthier the user, the\\nlarger the proportion of their balance and the higher the certainty they tend\\nto sell.

In meiosis II mouse oocytes (developing egg cells) awaiting\\nfertilisation, the spindle, which is the protein structure responsible for\\ndividing genetic material in a cell, must maintain its position near the cell\\ncortex (the thin actin network bound to the cell membrane) for many hours.\\nHowever, the cytoplasmic streaming that accompanies this stable positioning\\nwould intuitively appear to destabilise the spindle position. Here, through a\\ncombination of numerical and analytical modelling, we reveal a new,\\nhydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning beneath the cortical cap.\\nWe show that this stability depends critically on the spindle size and the\\nactive driving from the cortex, and demonstrate that stable spindle positioning\\ncan result purely from a hydrodynamic suction force exerted on the spindle by\\nthe cytoplasmic flow.

Since it offers a well-motivated starting point for\\nthe study of physics at very high energies, we incorporate an $R^2$ term in the\\nPalatini gravity. In addition, afterward the inflation, the inflaton oscillates\\nabout the minimum of the inflation potential, and reheats the universe.

Most of the state-of-the-art architectures\\nuse transformers or diffusion-based models to perform this task, despite the\\nheavy computational burden that they require.

To overcome the above, this paper\\nexplores a novel design of Mamba, an emergent State-Space Model (SSM), called\\nMamba-ST, to perform style transfer. To do so, we adapt Mamba linear equation\\nto simulate the behavior of cross-attention layers, which are able to combine\\ntwo separate embeddings into a single output, but drastically reducing memory\\nusage and time complexity.

To facilitate the high-fidelity imaging of these signals,\\nwe introduce the universal Bayesian imaging kit (UBIK). Specifically, we\\npresent J-UBIK, a flexible and modular implementation leveraging the\\nJAX-accelerated NIFTy.re software as its backend. J-UBIK streamlines the\\nimplementation of the key Bayesian inference components, providing for all the\\nnecessary steps of Bayesian imaging pipelines. First, it provides adaptable\\nprior models for different sky realizations. Second, it includes likelihood\\nmodels tailored to specific instruments. So far, the package includes three\\ninstruments: Chandra and eROSITA for X-ray observations, and the James Webb\\nSpace Telescope (JWST) for the near- and mid-infrared. The aim is to expand\\nthis set in the future. Third, these models can be integrated with various\\ninference and optimization schemes, such as maximum a posteriori estimation and\\nvariational inference. Explicit demos show how to integrate the individual\\nmodules into a full analysis pipeline. Overall, J-UBIK enables efficient\\ngeneration of high-fidelity images via Bayesian pipelines that can be tailored\\nto specific research objectives.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10381v1) |\\n| Thermolectricity in irradiated bilayer graphene flakes | Cynthia Ihuoma Osuala, Tanu Choudhary, Raju K. Biswas, Sudin Ganguly, Chunlei Qu, Santanu K. Maiti |   We present a comprehensive study on enhancing the thermoelectric (TE)\\nperformance of bilayer graphene (BLG) through irradiation with arbitrarily\\npolarized light, focusing on $AA$- and $AB$-stacked configurations with zigzag\\nedges. Utilizing a combination of tight-binding theory and density functional\\ntheory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on\\nelectronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the\\nelectronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function,\\nwhich significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the\\noverall {\\\\it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT\\ncalculations reveal that $AB$-stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal\\nconductivity compared to $AA$-stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic\\nscattering and phonon group velocity. The combined analysis shows that FOM\\nexceeds unity in both stacking types, with notable improvements near the\\nirradiation-induced gap. Additionally, we explore the dependence of FOM on the\\nsystem dimensions and temperature, demonstrating that light-irradiated BLG\\nholds great promise for efficient thermoelectric energy conversion and waste\\nheat recovery. Our results show favorable responses over a wide range of\\nirradiation parameters. These findings provide crucial insights into optimizing\\nBLG for advanced TE applications through light-induced modifications.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10380v1) |\\n| Leveraging Joint Spectral and Spatial Learning with MAMBA for\\n  Multichannel Speech Enhancement | Wenze Ren, Haibin Wu, Yi-Cheng Lin, Xuanjun Chen, Rong Chao, Kuo-Hsuan Hung, You-Jin Li, Wen-Yuan Ting, Hsin-Min Wang, Yu Tsao |   In multichannel speech enhancement, effectively capturing spatial and\\nspectral information across different microphones is crucial for noise\\nreduction.

This study introduces\\na novel statistical approach, TAR4C, to dissect causal interactions in\\nmultichannel EEG recordings. TAR4C uses the threshold autoregressive model to\\ndescribe the causal interaction between nodes or clusters of nodes in a brain\\nnetwork. The perspective involves testing whether one node, which may represent\\na brain region, can control the dynamics of the other. The node that has such\\nan impact on the other is called a threshold variable and can be classified as\\na causative because its functionality is the leading source operating as an\\ninstantaneous switching mechanism that regulates the time-varying\\nautoregressive structure of the other. This statistical concept is commonly\\nreferred to as threshold non-linearity. Once threshold non-linearity has been\\nverified between a pair of nodes, the subsequent essential facet of TAR\\nmodeling is to assess the predictive ability of the causal node for the current\\nactivity on the other and represent causal interactions in autoregressive\\nterms. This predictive ability is what underlies Granger causality. The TAR4C\\napproach can discover non-linear and time-dependent causal interactions without\\nnegating the G-causality perspective. The efficacy of the proposed approach is\\nexemplified by analyzing the EEG signals recorded during the motor\\nmovement/imagery experiment. The similarities and differences between the\\ncausal interactions manifesting during the execution and the imagery of a given\\nmotor movement are demonstrated by analyzing EEG recordings from multiple\\nsubjects.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10374v1) |\\n| Instigating Cooperation among LLM Agents Using Adaptive Information\\n  Modulation | Qiliang Chen,  Alireza,  Ilami, Nunzio Lore, Babak Heydari |   This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for\\nhuman strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these\\nagents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments.

Their widespread\\nindustrial use and resistance to degradation have led to global environmental\\ncontamination and significant health concerns. While a minority of PFAS have\\nbeen extensively studied, the toxicity of many PFAS remains poorly understood\\ndue to limited direct toxicological data. This study advances the predictive\\nmodeling of PFAS toxicity by combining semi-supervised graph convolutional\\nnetworks (GCNs) with molecular descriptors and fingerprints. We propose a novel\\napproach to enhance the prediction of PFAS binding affinities by isolating\\nmolecular fingerprints to construct graphs where then descriptors are set as\\nthe node features. This approach specifically captures the structural,\\nphysicochemical, and topological features of PFAS without overfitting due to an\\nabundance of features. Unsupervised clustering then identifies representative\\ncompounds for detailed binding studies.

To meet\\nperformance constraints, state-of-the-art control methods such as Incremental\\nNonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) or other adaptive control techniques require\\nhigh control gains to mitigate the effects of uncertainty entering the system.\\nWhile achieving good tracking performance, IDNI requires excessive control\\neffort, results in high actuator strain, and reduced flight smoothness due to\\nconstant and aggressive corrective actions commanded by the controller.

We present EF4INCA, a spatiotemporal Transformer model\\nfor precipitation nowcasting that integrates satellite- and ground-based\\nobservations with numerical weather prediction outputs. EF4INCA provides\\nhigh-resolution forecasts over Austria, accurately predicting the location and\\nshape of precipitation fields with a spatial resolution of 1 kilometre and a\\ntemporal resolution of 5 minutes, up to 90 minutes ahead. Our evaluation shows\\nthat EF4INCA outperforms conventional nowcasting models, including the\\noperational model of Austria, particularly in scenarios with complex temporal\\nfeatures such as convective initiation and rapid weather changes.

However, the quadratic time complexity of attention\\noperation poses a significant challenge for scaling to longer contexts due to\\nthe extremely high inference latency and GPU memory consumption for caching\\nkey-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free\\napproach to accelerate attention computation. To leverage the dynamic sparse\\nproperty of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor\\nsearch (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most\\nrelevant ones via vector search during generation. Due to the\\nout-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors, off-the-shelf\\nANNS indexes still need to scan O(N) (usually 30% of all keys) data for\\naccurate retrieval, which fails to exploit the high sparsity.\\nRetrievalAttention first identifies the OOD challenge of ANNS-based attention,\\nand addresses it via an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt\\nto queries and only access 1--3% of data, thus achieving a sub-linear time\\ncomplexity. RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of\\nlong-context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the\\nmodel accuracy.

However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning\\ncapabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this\\nwork, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as\\nsolving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to\\nsearch over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then\\napply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the\\napplication of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in\\na cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell.

Douglas |   Continuous wavefront sensing benefits space observatories in on-orbit optical\\nperformance maintenance. To measure the phase of a wavefront, phase retrieval\\nis an attractive technique as it uses multiple point spread function (PSF)\\nimages that are acquired by the telescope itself without extra metrology\\nsystems nor complicated calibration. The focus diverse phase retrieval utilizes\\nPSFs from predetermined defocused positions to enhance the dynamic range of the\\nalgorithm. We describe an updated visible light active optics testbed with the\\naddition of a linear motorized focus stage. The performance of the phase\\nretrieval algorithm in broadband is tested under various cases. While broadband\\npass filters have advantages in higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the\\nperformance of phase retrieval can be restricted due to blurred image caused by\\ndiffraction and increased computing cost. We used multiple bandpass filters (10\\nnm, 88 nm, and 150 nm) and investigated effects of bandwidth on the accuracy\\nand required image acquisition conditions such as SNR, reaching accuracies\\nbelow 20 nm RMS wavefront error at the widest bandwidth. We also investigated\\nthe dynamic range of the phase retrieval algorithm depending on the bandwidth\\nand required amount of defocus to expand dynamic range. Finally, we simulated\\nthe continuous wavefront sensing and correction loop with a range of\\nstatistically generated representative telescope disturbance time series to\\ntest for edge cases.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10500v1) |\\n| The role of higher-order terms in trapped-ion quantum computing with\\n  magnetic gradient induced coupling | Sebastian Nagies, Kevin T. Geier, Javed Akram, Junichi Okamoto, Dimitris Badounas, Christof Wunderlich, Michael Johanning, Philipp Hauke |   Trapped-ion hardware based on the Magnetic Gradient Induced Coupling (MAGIC)\\nscheme is emerging as a promising platform for quantum computing. Nevertheless,\\nin this (as in any other) quantum-computing platform, many technical questions\\nstill have to be resolved before large-scale and error-tolerant applications\\nare possible. In this work, we present a thorough discussion of the\\ncontribution of higher-order terms to the MAGIC setup, which can occur due to\\nanharmonicities in the external potential of the ion crystal (e.g., through\\nCoulomb repulsion) or through curvature of the applied magnetic field. These\\nterms take the form of three-spin couplings as well as diverse terms that\\ncouple spins to phonons. We find that most of these are negligible in realistic\\nsituations, with only two contributions that need careful attention. First,\\nthere are parasitic longitudinal fields whose strength increases with chain\\nlength, but which can easily be compensated by a microwave detuning. Second,\\nanharmonicities of the Coulomb interaction can lead to well-known two-to-one\\nconversions of phonon excitations, which can be avoided if the phonons are\\nground-state cooled. Our detailed analysis constitutes an important\\ncontribution on the way of making magnetic-gradient trapped-ion quantum\\ntechnology fit for large-scale applications, and it may inspire new ways to\\npurposefully design interaction terms.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10498v1) |\\n| MusicLIME: Explainable Multimodal Music Understanding | Theodoros Sotirou, Vassilis Lyberatos, Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Stamou |   Multimodal models are critical for music understanding tasks, as they capture\\nthe complex interplay between audio and lyrics.

In this paper, we introduce MusicLIME, a model-agnostic\\nfeature importance explanation method designed for multimodal music models.\\nUnlike traditional unimodal methods, which analyze each modality separately\\nwithout considering the interaction between them, often leading to incomplete\\nor misleading explanations, MusicLIME reveals how audio and lyrical features\\ninteract and contribute to predictions, providing a holistic view of the\\nmodel's decision-making. Additionally, we enhance local explanations by\\naggregating them into global explanations, giving users a broader perspective\\nof model behavior.

Our paper aims to investigate if VLMs\\npre-trained on web-scale data learn to encode object states, which can be\\nextracted with zero-shot text prompts. We curate an object state recognition\\ndataset ChangeIt-Frames, and evaluate nine open-source VLMs, including models\\ntrained with contrastive and generative objectives. We observe that while these\\nstate-of-the-art vision-language models can reliably perform object\\nrecognition, they consistently fail to accurately distinguish the objects'\\nphysical states. Through extensive experiments, we identify three areas for\\nimprovements for VLMs to better encode object states, namely the quality of\\nobject localization, the architecture to bind concepts to objects, and the\\nobjective to learn discriminative visual and language encoders on object\\nstates.

Ruan, Michael Eracleous, Daryl Haggard, Jessie C. Runnoe |   The physical processes that produce X-ray Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs)\\nrecently discovered from the nuclei of several low-redshift galaxies are\\nmysterious. Several pieces of observational evidence strongly suggest a link\\nbetween QPEs and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE). Previous studies also reveal\\nthat the morphologies of TDE host galaxies are highly concentrated, with high\\nSersic indicies, bulge-to-total light (B/T) ratios, and stellar surface mass\\ndensities relative to the broader galaxy population. We use these distinctive\\nproperties to test the link between QPEs and TDEs, by comparing these\\nparameters of QPE host galaxies to TDE host galaxies. We employ archival Legacy\\nSurvey images of a sample of 9 QPE host galaxies and a sample of 13 TDE host\\ngalaxies, and model their surface brightness profiles. We show that QPE host\\ngalaxies have high Sersic indices of ~3, high B/T ratios of ~0.5, and high\\nsurface mass densities of ~10^10 Msun kpc^-2. These properties are similar to\\nTDE host galaxies, but are in strong contrast to a mass- and redshift-matched\\ncontrol sample of galaxies. We also find tentative evidence that the central\\nblack holes in both QPE and TDE host galaxies are undermassive relative to\\ntheir stellar mass. The morphological similarities between QPE and TDE host\\ngalaxies at the population level add to the mounting evidence of a physical\\nlink between these phenomena, and favor QPE models that also invoke TDEs.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10486v1) |\\n| Tuning the Rate of Tightly Packed Systems To Produce Planet Occurrence\\n  Trends with Galactic Height | Sarah Ballard |   The formation of planetary systems has historically been considered in\\nisolation, decoupled from processes on galactic scales. Recent findings\\nemploying data from ESA's Gaia mission challenge this narrative, identifying\\ntrends in planet occurrence with galactic kinematics and stellar age. The\\nfindings indicate changes in planet occurrence over and above the predicted\\nchanges from metallicity variation within the Milky Way, so that changes to\\nstellar metallicity alone (long understood to be deterministic in planet\\noutcomes) cannot explain the trends entirely. The scope of potential factors\\ninfluencing planet formation has grown progressively wider, with accompanying\\ntheoretical support for galactic-scale influences upon planet formation. In\\nthis manuscript, we investigate specifically how changes to the rate of Systems\\nof Tightly-packed Inner Planets (STIPs) could manifest as a trend in planet\\noccurrence with galactic height. We focus our study upon M dwarf planetary\\nsystems for two reasons: first, they host STIPs at high rates, and secondly,\\ntheir longevity makes them useful probes for kinematic trends over Gyr. We\\nconsider two models for a varying STIP rate: one in which STIP likelihood is\\ndetermined by stellar age alone, irrespective of galactic time, and another in\\nwhich the STIP likelihood suddenly increased in recent galactic history. Both\\nmodels, which impose a higher STIP likelihood among younger stars, produce a\\nnegative gradient in planet occurrence with increasing height from the galactic\\nmidplane. We find that a step function model in which STIP likelihood increased\\nby a factor of several ~a few Gyr ago resembles an observed trend among FGK\\ndwarfs. We consider plausible physical mechanisms that could mimic the\\nhypothesized model, given known links between STIP occurrence and other stellar\\nand planetary properties.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10485v1) |\\n| XLM for Autonomous Driving Systems: A Comprehensive Review | Sonda Fourati, Wael Jaafar, Noura Baccar, Safwan Alfattani |   Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable proficiency in various\\ninformation-processing tasks.

Fay, Nicolas Ferr\\u00e9, Miquel Huix-Rotllant |   Electronic polarization and dispersion are decisive actors in determining\\ninteraction energies between molecules. These interactions have a particularly\\nprofound effect on excitation energies of molecules in complex environments,\\nespecially when the excitation involves a significant degree of charge\\nreorganisation. The direct reaction field (DRF) approach, which has seen a\\nrecent revival of interest, provides a powerful framework for describing these\\ninteractions in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models of\\nsystems, where a small subsystem of interest is described using quantum\\nchemical methods and the remainder is treated with a simple MM force field. In\\nthis paper we show how the DRF approach can be combined with the electrostatic\\npotential fitted (ESPF) multipole operator description of the QM region charge\\ndensity, which reduces the scaling $\\\\mathcal{O}(N_\\\\mathrm{MM}^3)$ of the method\\nwith MM system to $\\\\mathcal{O}(N_\\\\mathrm{MM}^2)$. We also show how the DRF\\napproach can be combined with fluctuating charge descriptions of the\\npolarizable environment, as well as previously used atom-centred\\ndipole-polarizability based models.

One of the classical and popular approaches is Local\\nStochastic Gradient Descent (Local SGD), characterized by multiple local\\nupdates before averaging, which is particularly useful in distributed\\nenvironments to reduce communication bottlenecks and improve scalability. A\\ntypical feature of this method is the dependence on the frequency of\\ncommunications. But in the case of a quadratic target function with homogeneous\\ndata distribution over all devices, the influence of frequency of\\ncommunications vanishes. As a natural consequence, subsequent studies include\\nthe assumption of a Lipschitz Hessian, as this indicates the similarity of the\\noptimized function to a quadratic one to some extent. However, in order to\\nextend the completeness of the Local SGD theory and unlock its potential, in\\nthis paper we abandon the Lipschitz Hessian assumption by introducing a new\\nconcept of $\\\\textit{approximate quadraticity}$. This assumption gives a new\\nperspective on problems that have near quadratic properties. In addition,\\nexisting theoretical analyses of Local SGD often assume bounded variance.

However, previous works either rely on contrastive learning that\\nsuffers false negative problems or are based on reconstruction that learns too\\nmuch unessential low-level clues, leading to limited representations for\\ndownstream tasks. Recently, great advances have been made in generative\\nlearning, which is naturally a challenging yet meaningful pretext task to model\\nthe general underlying data distributions. However, the representation learning\\ncapacity of generative models is under-explored, especially for the skeletons\\nwith spacial sparsity and temporal redundancy. To this end, we propose Masked\\nConditional Diffusion (MacDiff) as a unified framework for human skeleton\\nmodeling. For the first time, we leverage diffusion models as effective\\nskeleton representation learners. Specifically, we train a diffusion decoder\\nconditioned on the representations extracted by a semantic encoder. Random\\nmasking is applied to encoder inputs to introduce a information bottleneck and\\nremove redundancy of skeletons. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that\\nour generative objective involves the contrastive learning objective which\\naligns the masked and noisy views. Meanwhile, it also enforces the\\nrepresentation to complement for the noisy view, leading to better\\ngeneralization performance. MacDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on\\nrepresentation learning benchmarks while maintaining the competence for\\ngenerative tasks. Moreover, we leverage the diffusion model for data\\naugmentation, significantly enhancing the fine-tuning performance in scenarios\\nwith scarce labeled data.

Similar to traditional\\nsoftware dependencies, PTLMs continue to evolve after a release. However, the\\ncurrent state of release practices of PTLMs on model registry platforms are\\nplagued by a variety of inconsistencies, such as ambiguous naming conventions\\nand inaccessible model training documentation. Given the knowledge gap on\\ncurrent PTLM release practices, our empirical study uses a mixed-methods\\napproach to analyze the releases of 52,227 PTLMs on the most well-known model\\nregistry, HF. Our results reveal 148 different naming practices for PTLM\\nreleases, with 40.87% of changes to model weight files not represented in the\\nadopted name-based versioning practice or their documentation. In addition, we\\nidentified that the 52,227 PTLMs are derived from only 299 different base\\nmodels (the modified original models used to create 52,227 PTLMs), with\\nFine-tuning and Quantization being the most prevalent modification methods\\napplied to these base models. Significant gaps in release transparency, in\\nterms of training dataset specifications and model card availability, still\\nexist, highlighting the need for standardized documentation. While we\\nidentified a model naming practice explicitly differentiating between major and\\nminor PTLM releases, we did not find any significant difference in the types of\\nchanges that went into either type of releases, suggesting that major/minor\\nversion numbers for PTLMs often are chosen arbitrarily.

F. Lizarraga, Flavia M. D. Marquitti, Marcus A. M. de Aguiar |   We investigate the role of assortative mating in speciation using the\\nsympatric model of Derrida and Higgs. The model explores the idea that genetic\\ndifferences create incompatibilities between individuals, preventing mating if\\nthe number of such differences is too large. Speciation, however, only happens\\nin this mating system if the number of genes is large. Here we show that\\nspeciation with small genome sizes can occur if assortative mating is\\nintroduced. In our model individuals are represented by three chromosomes: one\\nresponsible for reproductive compatibility, one for coding the trait on which\\nassortativity will operate, and a neutral chromosome. Reproduction is possible\\nif individuals are genetically similar with respect to the first chromosome,\\nbut among these compatible mating partners, the one with the most similar trait\\ncoded by the second chromosome is selected. We show that this type of\\nassortativity facilitates speciation, which can happen with a small number of\\ngenes in the first chromosome. Species, classified according to reproductive\\nisolation, dictated by the first chromosome, can display different traits\\nvalues, as measured by the second and the third chromosomes.

We\\ncall their test the Diamond test and show that it is indeed a direct sum\\ntester. More specifically, we show that if a function $f$ is $\\\\epsilon$-far\\nfrom being a direct sum function, then the Diamond test rejects $f$ with\\nprobability at least $\\\\Omega_{n,\\\\epsilon}(1)$. Even in the case of $n = 2$, the\\nDiamond test is, to the best of our knowledge, novel and yields a new tester\\nfor the classic property of affinity.\\n  Apart from the Diamond test, we also analyze a broad family of direct sum\\ntests, which at a high level, run an arbitrary affinity test on the restriction\\nof $f$ to a random hypercube inside of $[n]^d$. This family of tests includes\\nthe direct sum test analyzed in \\\\cite{di19}, but does not include the Diamond\\ntest. As an application of our result, we obtain a direct sum test which works\\nin the online adversary model of \\\\cite{KRV}.\\n  Finally, we also discuss a Fourier analytic interpretation of the diamond\\ntester in the $n=2$ case, as well as prove local correction results for direct\\nsum as conjectured by Dinur and Golubev.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10464v1) |\\n| Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks in Low-Data Regimes: A Comparative Study with\\n  Multilayer Perceptrons | Farhad Pourkamali-Anaraki |   Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) have long been a cornerstone in deep learning,\\nknown for their capacity to model complex relationships. Recently,\\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a compelling alternative,\\nutilizing highly flexible learnable activation functions directly on network\\nedges, a departure from the neuron-centric approach of MLPs. However, KANs\\nsignificantly increase the number of learnable parameters, raising concerns\\nabout their effectiveness in data-scarce environments. This paper presents a\\ncomprehensive comparative study of MLPs and KANs from both algorithmic and\\nexperimental perspectives, with a focus on low-data regimes. We introduce an\\neffective technique for designing MLPs with unique, parameterized activation\\nfunctions for each neuron, enabling a more balanced comparison with KANs. Using\\nempirical evaluations on simulated data and two real-world data sets from\\nmedicine and engineering, we explore the trade-offs between model complexity\\nand accuracy, with particular attention to the role of network depth. Our\\nfindings show that MLPs with individualized activation functions achieve\\nsignificantly higher predictive accuracy with only a modest increase in\\nparameters, especially when the sample size is limited to around one hundred.\\nFor example, in a three-class classification problem within additive\\nmanufacturing, MLPs achieve a median accuracy of 0.91, significantly\\noutperforming KANs, which only reach a median accuracy of 0.53 with default\\nhyperparameters. These results offer valuable insights into the impact of\\nactivation function selection in neural networks.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10463v1) |\\n| Effects of synapse location, delay and background stochastic activity on\\n  synchronising hippocampal CA1 neurons | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore |   We study the synchronisation of neurons in a realistic model under the\\nHodgkin-Huxley dynamics. To focus on the role of the different locations of the\\nexcitatory synapses, we use two identical neurons where the set of input\\nsignals is grouped at two different distances from the soma. The system is\\nintended to represent a CA1 hippocampal neuron in which the synapses arriving\\nfrom the CA3 neurons of the trisynaptic pathway appear to be localised in the\\napical dendritic region and are, in principle, either proximal or distal to the\\nsoma. Synchronisation is studied using a specifically defined spiking\\ncorrelation function as a function of various parameters such as the distance\\nfrom the soma of one of the synaptic groups, the inhibition weight and the\\nassociated activation delay. We found that the neurons' spiking activity\\ndepends nonmonotonically on the relative dendritic location of the synapses and\\ntheir inhibitory weight, whereas the synchronisation measure always decreases\\nwith inhibition, and strongly depends on its activation time delay. The\\nbackground activity on the somas results essentially independent on the\\nfluctuation intensity and strongly support the importance of the balance\\nbetween inhibition and excitation for neuronal synchronization.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10460v1) |\\n| Efficiently Crowdsourcing Visual Importance with Punch-Hole Annotation | Minsuk Chang, Soohyun Lee, Aeri Cho, Hyeon Jeon, Seokhyeon Park, Cindy Xiong Bearfield, Jinwook Seo |   We introduce a novel crowdsourcing method for identifying important areas in\\ngraphical images through punch-hole labeling. Traditional methods, such as gaze\\ntrackers and mouse-based annotations, which generate continuous data, can be\\nimpractical in crowdsourcing scenarios. They require many participants, and the\\noutcome data can be noisy. In contrast, our method first segments the graphical\\nimage with a grid and drops a portion of the patches (punch holes). Then, we\\niteratively ask the labeler to validate each annotation with holes, narrowing\\ndown the annotation only having the most important area. This approach aims to\\nreduce annotation noise in crowdsourcing by standardizing the annotations while\\nenhancing labeling efficiency and reliability. Preliminary findings from\\nfundamental charts demonstrate that punch-hole labeling can effectively\\npinpoint critical regions. This also highlights its potential for broader\\napplication in visualization research, particularly in studying large-scale\\nusers' graphical perception. Our future work aims to enhance the algorithm to\\nachieve faster labeling speed and prove its utility through large-scale\\nexperiments.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10459v1) |\\n| Full distribution of local observables in an exactly solvable current\\n  carrying steady states of a driven XXZ chain | Sandipan Manna, G J Sreejith |   Current carrying steady states of interacting spins chains exhibit rich\\nstructures generated through an interplay of current induced correlations and\\nenergetic constraints from the Hamiltonian. The XXZ spin chain when coupled to\\nmaximally polarizing Lindblad terms admits an exact solution in a matrix\\nproduct state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations\\nand distributions of simple local spin observables in the non equilibrium\\nsteady state (NESS). We present exact expressions for spin correlators, entropy\\nper site, cumulant generating functions for distributions of local observables\\nin the XX limit (Ising anisotropy $\\\\Delta=0$). Further, we use the exact MPS\\nsolution in systems with $\\\\Delta>0$, to numerically exactly calculate the\\nentropy, correlations, as well as distributions of spin observables in blocks\\nas large as $n\\\\sim 200$ sites allowing an estimation of the rate functions. The\\n$z$ magnetization distribution is consistant with short range spin correlations\\nin the $z$ direction while the $x$-magnetization shows a double peak structure\\nat larger $\\\\Delta$ suggesting short range ferromagnetic ordering.

Its applications\\ncontinue to expand as researchers delve deeper into understanding the complex\\ndynamics of ageing and its implications for society. One common approach to\\ndefining the ageing intensity function is through the hazard rate or failure\\nrate function, extensively explored in scholarly literature. Equally\\nsignificant to the hazard rate function is the mean residual life function,\\nwhich plays a crucial role in analyzing the ageing patterns exhibited by units\\nor components. This article introduces the mean residual life ageing intensity\\n(MRLAI) function to delve into component ageing behaviours across various\\ndistributions. Additionally, we scrutinize the closure properties of the MRLAI\\nfunction across different reliability operations.

Bottke, Robert Jedicke, Shantanu Naidu, Steven R. Chesley, Davide Farnocchia, Paul W. Chodas |   This work is dedicated to debias the Near-Earth Objects (NEO) population\\nbased on observations from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System\\n(ATLAS) telescopes. We have applied similar methods used to develop the\\nrecently released NEO model generator (NEOMOD), once debiasing the NEO\\npopulation using data from Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) G96 telescope. ATLAS is\\ncomposed of four different telescopes. We first analyzed observational data\\nfrom each of all four telescopes separately and later combined them. Our\\nresults highlight main differences between CSS and ATLAS, e.g., sky coverage\\nand survey power at debiasing the NEO population. ATLAS has a much larger sky\\ncoverage than CSS, allowing it to find bright NEOs that would be constantly\\n\\\"hiding\\\" from CSS. Consequently, ATLAS is more powerful than CSS at debiasing\\nthe NEO population for H $\\\\lesssim$ 19. With its intrinsically greater\\nsensitivity and emphasis on observing near opposition, CSS excels in the\\ndebiasing of smaller objects. ATLAS, as an all sky survey designed to find\\nimminent hazardous objects, necessarily spends a significant fraction of time\\nlooking at places on the sky where objects do not appear, reducing its power\\nfor debiasing the population of small objects. We estimate a NEO population\\ncompleteness of $\\\\approx$ 88%$^{+3\\\\%}_{-2\\\\%}$ for H $<$ 17.75 and $\\\\approx$\\n36%$^{+1\\\\%}_{-1\\\\%}$ for H $<$ 22.25. Those numbers are similar to previous\\nestimates (within error bars for H $<$ 17.75) from CSS, yet, around 3% and 8%\\nsmaller at their face values, respectively. We also confirm previous finding\\nthat the $\\\\nu_6$ secular resonance is the main source of small and faint NEOs\\nat H = 28, whereas the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter dominates for\\nlarger and brighter NEOs at H = 15.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10453v1) |\\n| Signed Graph Autoencoder for Explainable and Polarization-Aware Network\\n  Embeddings | Nikolaos Nakis, Chrysoula Kosma, Giannis Nikolentzos, Michalis Chatzianastasis, Iakovos Evdaimon, Michalis Vazirgiannis |   Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant\\nattention in recent years for their ability to extract informative latent\\nrepresentations, characterizing the structure of complex topologies, such as\\ngraphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited\\nfocus on developing and evaluating explainable neural-based graph generative\\nmodels specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we\\npropose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE\\nextracts node-level representations that express node memberships over distinct\\nextreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is\\nachieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its\\npolarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for\\nanalyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with\\nrelational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation\\ndemonstrates the SGAAEs' capability to successfully infer node memberships over\\nthe different underlying latent structures while extracting competing\\ncommunities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the\\nnetwork. Additionally, we introduce the 2-level network polarization problem\\nand show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model\\nachieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across\\nfour real-world datasets, outperforming several baseline models.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10452v1) |\\n| Why you should also use OLS estimation of tail exponents | Thiago Trafane Oliveira Santos, Daniel Oliveira Cajueiro |   Even though practitioners often estimate Pareto exponents running OLS\\nrank-size regressions, the usual recommendation is to use the Hill MLE with a\\nsmall-sample correction instead, due to its unbiasedness and efficiency. In\\nthis paper, we advocate that you should also apply OLS in empirical\\napplications. On the one hand, we demonstrate that, with a small-sample\\ncorrection, the OLS estimator is also unbiased. On the other hand, we show that\\nthe MLE assigns significantly greater weight to smaller observations. This\\nsuggests that the OLS estimator may outperform the MLE in cases where the\\ndistribution is (i) strictly Pareto but only in the upper tail or (ii)\\nregularly varying rather than strictly Pareto.

The observations were designed to ensure that the\\nflux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays,\\nand different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining\\nobserved aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions\\nbased on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of\\nthese observations were combined with model point-spread-functions to measure\\nthe corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with\\ntime, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time,\\nrate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations\\nwere with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately\\nevery month revealed a modest time-dependent response loss seen mainly at the\\nlongest wavelengths.

Yip |   Camera-to-robot calibration is crucial for vision-based robot control and\\nrequires effort to make it accurate. Recent advancements in markerless pose\\nestimation methods have eliminated the need for time-consuming physical setups\\nfor camera-to-robot calibration. While the existing markerless pose estimation\\nmethods have demonstrated impressive accuracy without the need for cumbersome\\nsetups, they rely on the assumption that all the robot joints are visible\\nwithin the camera's field of view. However, in practice, robots usually move in\\nand out of view, and some portion of the robot may stay out-of-frame during the\\nwhole manipulation task due to real-world constraints, leading to a lack of\\nsufficient visual features and subsequent failure of these approaches. To\\naddress this challenge and enhance the applicability to vision-based robot\\ncontrol, we propose a novel framework capable of estimating the robot pose with\\npartially visible robot manipulators. Our approach leverages the\\nVision-Language Models for fine-grained robot components detection, and\\nintegrates it into a keypoint-based pose estimation network, which enables more\\nrobust performance in varied operational conditions.

The vast majority of\\nenergy-preserving reduced-order methods use symplectic Galerkin projection to\\nconstruct reduced-order Hamiltonian models by projecting the full models onto a\\nsymplectic subspace.

Next,\\nwe implement the protocol on IBM's quantum hardware and evaluate its\\nperformance in a realistic noisy environment. Additionally, by simulating\\ncommon attack models, we showcase that the protocol is secure against any\\neavesdropper in the channel. These findings highlight the protocol's robust\\nsecurity and practical feasibility for real-world secure quantum communication.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10427v1) |\\n| Role of kinematic constraints in the time reversal symmetry breaking of\\n  a model active matter | Soumen Das, Shankar Ghosh, Tridib Sadhu, Juliane U Klamser |   Active-matter systems are inherently out-of-equilibrium and perform\\nmechanical work by utilizing their internal energy sources. Breakdown of\\ntime-reversal symmetry (BTRS) is a hallmark of such dissipative non-equilibrium\\ndynamics. We introduce a robust, experimentally accessible, noninvasive,\\nquantitative measure of BTRS in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in\\ncollision events, demonstrated in our novel artificial active matter, comprised\\nof battery-powered spherical rolling robots whose energetics in different modes\\nof motion can be measured with high precision. Our dimensionless measure\\ncharacterizes how dissipation and internal energetics are influenced by\\nkinematic constraints from interactions with the environment. We propose this\\nmeasure of BTRS as an empirical estimate of the distance from equilibrium. An\\nenergetic insight into this departure of active matter from equilibrium comes\\nfrom our demonstration of a non-trivial fluctuation symmetry, which reveals a\\npotentially universal thermodynamic characteristic of active energetics. As a\\nmany-body consequence of BTRS in our experimental active system, we demonstrate\\nthe emergence of activity-induced herding, which has no equilibrium analogue.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10425v1) |\\n| Unveiling V Modes: Enhancing CMB Sensitivity to BSM Physics with a\\n  Non-Ideal Half-Wave Plate | N.

A realistic half-wave plate -\\nan optical element commonly used in CMB experiments to modulate the polarized\\nsignal - can provide sensitivity to V modes without significantly spoiling that\\nto linear polarization. We assess this sensitivity for some new-generation CMB\\nexperiments, such as the LiteBIRD satellite, the ground-based Simons\\nObservatory and a CMB-S4-like experiment. We forecast the efficiency of these\\nexperiments to constrain the phenomenology of certain classes of BSM models\\ninducing mixing of linear polarization states and generation of V modes in the\\nCMB.

However,\\nstate-of-the-art methods ignore a potentially valuable source of unsupervised\\nsemantic information -- spatial registration transforms between image volumes.\\nTo address this, we propose CCT-R, a contrastive cross-teaching framework\\nincorporating registration information. To leverage the semantic information\\navailable in registrations between volume pairs, CCT-R incorporates two\\nproposed modules: Registration Supervision Loss (RSL) and Registration-Enhanced\\nPositive Sampling (REPS). The RSL leverages segmentation knowledge derived from\\ntransforms between labeled and unlabeled volume pairs, providing an additional\\nsource of pseudo-labels. REPS enhances contrastive learning by identifying\\nanatomically-corresponding positives across volumes using registration\\ntransforms. Experimental results on two challenging medical segmentation\\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CCT-R across\\nvarious semi-supervised settings, with as few as one labeled case.

Given a text query, RGS\\ndetermines a stable grasp pose to manipulate the referred object in the robot's\\nworkspace. RGS comprises two steps: visual grounding and grasp pose estimation.\\nRecent studies leverage powerful Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for visually\\ngrounding free-flowing natural language in real-world robotic execution.\\nHowever, comparisons in complex, cluttered environments with multiple instances\\nof the same object are lacking. This paper introduces HiFi-CS, featuring\\nhierarchical application of Featurewise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to fuse image\\nand text embeddings, enhancing visual grounding for complex attribute rich text\\nqueries encountered in robotic grasping. Visual grounding associates an object\\nin 2D/3D space with natural language input and is studied in two scenarios:\\nClosed and Open Vocabulary. HiFi-CS features a lightweight decoder combined\\nwith a frozen VLM and outperforms competitive baselines in closed vocabulary\\nsettings while being 100x smaller in size.

Papoutsis, I. E. Papadakis, C. Panagiotou, M. Dov\\u010diak, E. Kammoun |   Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to be variable across all\\nwavelengths. Significant observational efforts have been invested in the last\\ndecade in studying their ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability. Long and\\ndensely sampled, multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns of numerous Seyfert\\ngalaxies have been conducted with the aim of determining the X-ray/UV/optical\\ncontinuum time lags. Time-lag studies can be used to constrain theoretical\\nmodels. The observed time lags can be explained by thermal reprocessing of the\\nX-rays illuminating the accretion disc (known as the X-ray reverberation\\nmodel). However, the observed light curves contain more information that can be\\nused to further constrain physical models. Our primary objective is to\\ninvestigate whether, in addition to time lags, the X-ray reverberation model\\ncan also explain the UV/optical variability amplitude of nearby Seyferts. To do\\nthis, we measured the excess variance of four sources (namely Mrk 509, NGC\\n4151, NGC 2617, and Mrk 142) as a function of wavelength using data from\\narchival long, multi-wavelength campaigns with Swift, and ground-based\\ntelescopes. We also computed the model excess variance in the case of the X-ray\\nreverberation model by determining the disc's transfer function and assuming a\\nbending power law for the X-ray power spectrum. We tested the validity of the\\nmodel by comparing the measured and model variances for a range of accretion\\nrates and X-ray source heights. We conclude that the X-ray thermal\\nreverberation model can fit both the continuum, UV/optical time lags, as well\\nas the variance in these AGNs, for the same physical parameters. Our results\\nsuggest that the accretion disc is constant and that all the observed\\nUV/optical variations, on timescales of days and up to a few weeks, can be\\nfully explained by the variable X-rays as they illuminate the accretion disc.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10417v1) |\\n| Local central limit theorem for Mallows measure | Alexey Bufetov, Kailun Chen |   We study the statistics of the Mallows measure on permutations in the limit\\npioneered by Starr (2009).

It covers 158\\nwidely-used SDKs from two key SDK release platforms, the official one and a\\nlarge alternative one. From them, we identified 338 instances of privacy data\\nexfiltration. On the privacy compliance, our study reveals that more than 30%\\nof the examined SDKs fail to provide a privacy policy to disclose their data\\nhandling practices.

However, our calculations\\nrevealed that the exponent parameters in both the drift and variance terms\\ndeviate slightly from one. This suggests that Gibrat's proportional growth rule\\nalone does not fully explain the log-normal distribution observed in Bitcoin\\nusers' balances. During our exploration, we discovered an intriguing\\nphenomenon: Bitcoin users tend to fall into two distinct categories based on\\ntheir behavior, which we refer to as ``poor\\\" and ``wealthy\\\" users. Poor users,\\nwho initially purchase only a small amount of Bitcoin, tend to buy more\\nbitcoins first and then sell out all their holdings gradually over time. The\\ncertainty of selling all their coins is higher and higher with time.

The speed at which they sell their\\nbitcoins is lower and lower over time and they will hold at least a small part\\nof their initial holdings at last.

The majority of work that has been\\ndone is focused on Deep Learning (DL) based approaches. However, with the\\nemergence of new algorithms such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm, there\\nis growing interest in exploring alternative approaches that may offer unique\\nadvantages in certain domains or applications. One of these domains is\\nFederated Learning (FL), in which users privacy is of utmost importance. Due to\\nits novelty, FL has seen a surge in the incorporation of personalization\\ntechniques to enhance model accuracy while maintaining user privacy under\\npersonalized conditions. In this work, we propose a novel approach dubbed TPFL:\\nTsetlin-Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into\\nclusters based on their confidence towards a specific class. In this way,\\nclustering can benefit from two key advantages. Firstly, clients share only\\nwhat they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight\\naggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been\\nenough during the training. This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are\\nnon-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID). Secondly, by sharing\\nonly weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially\\nreduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication\\ncost. The results of TPFL demonstrated the highest accuracy on three different\\ndatasets; namely MNIST, FashionMNIST and FEMNIST.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10392v1) |\\n| Prompt-and-Transfer: Dynamic Class-aware Enhancement for Few-shot\\n  Segmentation | Hanbo Bi, Yingchao Feng, Wenhui Diao, Peijin Wang, Yongqiang Mao, Kun Fu, Hongqi Wang, Xian Sun |   For more efficient generalization to unseen domains (classes), most Few-shot\\nSegmentation (FSS) would directly exploit pre-trained encoders and only\\nfine-tune the decoder, especially in the current era of large models. However,\\nsuch fixed feature encoders tend to be class-agnostic, inevitably activating\\nobjects that are irrelevant to the target class. In contrast, humans can\\neffortlessly focus on specific objects in the line of sight. This paper mimics\\nthe visual perception pattern of human beings and proposes a novel and powerful\\nprompt-driven scheme, called ``Prompt and Transfer\\\" (PAT), which constructs a\\ndynamic class-aware prompting paradigm to tune the encoder for focusing on the\\ninterested object (target class) in the current task. Three key points are\\nelaborated to enhance the prompting: 1) Cross-modal linguistic information is\\nintroduced to initialize prompts for each task. 2) Semantic Prompt Transfer\\n(SPT) that precisely transfers the class-specific semantics within the images\\nto prompts. 3) Part Mask Generator (PMG) that works in conjunction with SPT to\\nadaptively generate different but complementary part prompts for different\\nindividuals. Surprisingly, PAT achieves competitive performance on 4 different\\ntasks including standard FSS, Cross-domain FSS (e.g., CV, medical, and remote\\nsensing domains), Weak-label FSS, and Zero-shot Segmentation, setting new\\nstate-of-the-arts on 11 benchmarks.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10389v1) |\\n| Revising the Structure of Recurrent Neural Networks to Eliminate\\n  Numerical Derivatives in Forming Physics Informed Loss Terms with Respect to\\n  Time | Mahyar Jahani-nasab, Mohamad Ali Bijarchi |   Solving unsteady partial differential equations (PDEs) using recurrent neural\\nnetworks (RNNs) typically requires numerical derivatives between each block of\\nthe RNN to form the physics informed loss function. However, this introduces\\nthe complexities of numerical derivatives into the training process of these\\nmodels. In this study, we propose modifying the structure of the traditional\\nRNN to enable the prediction of each block over a time interval, making it\\npossible to calculate the derivative of the output with respect to time using\\nthe backpropagation algorithm. To achieve this, the time intervals of these\\nblocks are overlapped, defining a mutual loss function between them.\\nAdditionally, the employment of conditional hidden states enables us to achieve\\na unique solution for each block. The forget factor is utilized to control the\\ninfluence of the conditional hidden state on the prediction of the subsequent\\nblock. This new model, termed the Mutual Interval RNN (MI-RNN), is applied to\\nsolve three different benchmarks: the Burgers equation, unsteady heat\\nconduction in an irregular domain, and the Green vortex problem. Our results\\ndemonstrate that MI-RNN can find the exact solution more accurately compared to\\nexisting RNN models. For instance, in the second problem, MI-RNN achieved one\\norder of magnitude less relative error compared to the RNN model with numerical\\nderivatives.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10388v1) |\\n| Sharp decay rate for eigenfunctions of perturbed periodic Schr\\u00f6dinger\\n  operators | Wencai Liu, Rodrigo Matos, John N.

Most of the state-of-the-art architectures\\nuse transformers or diffusion-based models to perform this task, despite the\\nheavy computational burden that they require. In particular, transformers use\\nself- and cross-attention layers which have large memory footprint, while\\ndiffusion models require high inference time. To overcome the above, this paper\\nexplores a novel design of Mamba, an emergent State-Space Model (SSM), called\\nMamba-ST, to perform style transfer. To do so, we adapt Mamba linear equation\\nto simulate the behavior of cross-attention layers, which are able to combine\\ntwo separate embeddings into a single output, but drastically reducing memory\\nusage and time complexity. We modified the Mamba's inner equations so to accept\\ninputs from, and combine, two separate data streams. To the best of our\\nknowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt the equations of SSMs to a vision\\ntask like style transfer without requiring any other module like\\ncross-attention or custom normalization layers. An extensive set of experiments\\ndemonstrates the superiority and efficiency of our method in performing style\\ntransfer compared to transformers and diffusion models.

Biswas, Sudin Ganguly, Chunlei Qu, Santanu K. Maiti |   We present a comprehensive study on enhancing the thermoelectric (TE)\\nperformance of bilayer graphene (BLG) through irradiation with arbitrarily\\npolarized light, focusing on $AA$- and $AB$-stacked configurations with zigzag\\nedges. Utilizing a combination of tight-binding theory and density functional\\ntheory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on\\nelectronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the\\nelectronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function,\\nwhich significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the\\noverall {\\\\it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT\\ncalculations reveal that $AB$-stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal\\nconductivity compared to $AA$-stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic\\nscattering and phonon group velocity. The combined analysis shows that FOM\\nexceeds unity in both stacking types, with notable improvements near the\\nirradiation-induced gap. Additionally, we explore the dependence of FOM on the\\nsystem dimensions and temperature, demonstrating that light-irradiated BLG\\nholds great promise for efficient thermoelectric energy conversion and waste\\nheat recovery. Our results show favorable responses over a wide range of\\nirradiation parameters. These findings provide crucial insights into optimizing\\nBLG for advanced TE applications through light-induced modifications.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10380v1) |\\n| Leveraging Joint Spectral and Spatial Learning with MAMBA for\\n  Multichannel Speech Enhancement | Wenze Ren, Haibin Wu, Yi-Cheng Lin, Xuanjun Chen, Rong Chao, Kuo-Hsuan Hung, You-Jin Li, Wen-Yuan Ting, Hsin-Min Wang, Yu Tsao |   In multichannel speech enhancement, effectively capturing spatial and\\nspectral information across different microphones is crucial for noise\\nreduction.

This study introduces\\na novel statistical approach, TAR4C, to dissect causal interactions in\\nmultichannel EEG recordings. TAR4C uses the threshold autoregressive model to\\ndescribe the causal interaction between nodes or clusters of nodes in a brain\\nnetwork. The perspective involves testing whether one node, which may represent\\na brain region, can control the dynamics of the other. The node that has such\\nan impact on the other is called a threshold variable and can be classified as\\na causative because its functionality is the leading source operating as an\\ninstantaneous switching mechanism that regulates the time-varying\\nautoregressive structure of the other. This statistical concept is commonly\\nreferred to as threshold non-linearity. Once threshold non-linearity has been\\nverified between a pair of nodes, the subsequent essential facet of TAR\\nmodeling is to assess the predictive ability of the causal node for the current\\nactivity on the other and represent causal interactions in autoregressive\\nterms. This predictive ability is what underlies Granger causality. The TAR4C\\napproach can discover non-linear and time-dependent causal interactions without\\nnegating the G-causality perspective. The efficacy of the proposed approach is\\nexemplified by analyzing the EEG signals recorded during the motor\\nmovement/imagery experiment. The similarities and differences between the\\ncausal interactions manifesting during the execution and the imagery of a given\\nmotor movement are demonstrated by analyzing EEG recordings from multiple\\nsubjects.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10374v1) |\\n| Instigating Cooperation among LLM Agents Using Adaptive Information\\n  Modulation | Qiliang Chen,  Alireza,  Ilami, Nunzio Lore, Babak Heydari |   This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for\\nhuman strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these\\nagents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments.

To leverage the dynamic sparse\\nproperty of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor\\nsearch (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most\\nrelevant ones via vector search during generation.

Specifically, we investigate the role of resistivity\\nin the dynamical evolution of neutron stars over a period of up to 100 ms and\\nits effects on their quasi-equilibrium configurations. Our results demonstrate\\nthat resistivity can significantly influence the development of\\nmagnetohydrodynamic instabilities, resulting in markedly different magnetic\\nfield geometries. Additionally, resistivity suppresses the growth of these\\ninstabilities, leading to a reduction in the amplitude of emitted gravitational\\nwaves. Despite the variations in magnetic field geometries, the ratio of\\npoloidal to toroidal field energies remains consistently 9:1 throughout the\\nsimulations, for the models we investigated.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10508v1) |\\n| Beth-Uhlenbeck equation for the thermodynamics of fluctuations in a\\n  generalised 2+1D Gross-Neveu model | Biplab Mahato, David Blaschke, Dietmar Ebert |   We study a generalised version of Gross-Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions.

We propose an LLM-based translation\\nscheme that improves the success rate of translating large-scale C code into\\ncompilable Rust code. Our approach involves three key techniques: (1)\\npre-processing the C code to better align its structure and expressions with\\nRust, (2) segmenting the code into optimally sized translation units to avoid\\nexceeding the LLM's context window limits, and (3) iteratively compiling and\\nrepairing errors while maintaining consistency between translation units using\\ncontext-supplementing prompts. Compilation success is an essential first step\\nin achieving functional equivalence, as only compilable code can be further\\ntested. In experiments with 20 benchmark C programs, including those exceeding\\n4 kilo lines of code, we successfully translated all programs into compilable\\nRust code without losing corresponding parts of the original code.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10506v1) |\\n| Machine Learning Optimization of non-Kasha Behavior and of Transient\\n  Dynamics in Model Retinal Isomerization | Davinder Singh, Chern Chuang, Paul Brumer |   Designing a model of retinal isomerization in Rhodopsin, the first step in\\nvision, that accounts for both experimental transient and stationary state\\nobservables is challenging. Here, multi-objective Bayesian optimization is\\nemployed to refine the parameters of a minimal two-state-two-mode (TM) model\\ndescribing the photoisomerization of retinal in Rhodopsin. With an appropriate\\nselection of objectives, the optimized retinal model predicts excitation\\nwavelength-dependent fluorescence spectra that closely align with\\nexperimentally observed non-Kasha behavior in the non-equilibrium steady state.\\nFurther, adjustments to the potential energy surface within the TM model reduce\\nthe discrepancies across the time domain.

Existing works often rely\\non local interpretability methods, failing to provide comprehensive\\nexplanations of the overall mechanism behind each label prediction within a\\nmultilabel set. We propose a mechanistic interpretability module called\\nDIctionary Label Attention (\\\\method) that disentangles uninterpretable dense\\nembeddings into a sparse embedding space, where each nonzero element (a\\ndictionary feature) represents a globally learned medical concept. Through\\nhuman evaluations, we show that our sparse embeddings are more human\\nunderstandable than its dense counterparts by at least 50 percent. Our\\nautomated dictionary feature identification pipeline, leveraging large language\\nmodels (LLMs), uncovers thousands of learned medical concepts by examining and\\nsummarizing the highest activating tokens for each dictionary feature. We\\nrepresent the relationships between dictionary features and medical codes\\nthrough a sparse interpretable matrix, enhancing the mechanistic and global\\nunderstanding of the model's predictions while maintaining competitive\\nperformance and scalability without extensive human annotation.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10504v1) |\\n| Causal Language Modeling Can Elicit Search and Reasoning Capabilities on\\n  Logic Puzzles | Kulin Shah, Nishanth Dikkala, Xin Wang, Rina Panigrahy |   Causal language modeling using the Transformer architecture has yielded\\nremarkable capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) over the last few\\nyears. However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning\\ncapabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this\\nwork, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as\\nsolving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to\\nsearch over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then\\napply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the\\napplication of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in\\na cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases,\\nmultiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We\\nobserve that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn\\nto solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21\\\\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly)\\nwhen trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that\\ntraining Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and\\nwithout such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis\\nto Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves\\n$92.04 \\\\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal\\nrepresentations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear\\nprobing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any\\ngiven cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine\\nimplicit in the Transformer weights.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10502v1) |\\n| Alignment with nonlinear velocity couplings: collision-avoidance and\\n  micro-to-macro mean-field limits | Young-Pil Choi, Micha\\u0142 Fabisiak, Jan Peszek |   We investigate the pressureless fractional Euler-alignment system with\\nnonlinear velocity couplings, referred to as the $p$-Euler-alignment system.\\nThis model features a nonlinear velocity alignment force, interpreted as a\\ndensity-weighted fractional $p$-Laplacian when the singularity parameter\\n$\\\\alpha$ exceeds the spatial dimension $d$. Our primary goal is to establish\\nthe existence of solutions for strongly singular interactions ($\\\\alpha \\\\ge d$)\\nand compactly supported initial conditions. We construct solutions as\\nmean-field limits of empirical measures from a kinetic variant of the\\n$p$-Euler-alignment system. Specifically, we show that a sequence of empirical\\nmeasures converges to a finite Radon measure, whose local density and velocity\\nsatisfy the $p$-Euler-alignment system. Our results are the first to prove the\\nexistence of solutions to this system in multi-dimensional settings without\\nsignificant initial data restrictions, covering both nonlinear ($p>2$) and\\nlinear ($p=2$) cases. Additionally, we establish global existence, uniqueness,\\nand collision avoidance for the corresponding particle ODE system under\\nnon-collisional initial conditions, extending previous results for $1 \\\\le p \\\\le\\n\\\\alpha + 2$. This analysis supports our mean-field limit argument and\\ncontributes to understanding alignment models with singular communication.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10501v1) |\\n| Focus diverse phase retrieval test results on broadband continuous\\n  wavefront sensing in space telescope applications | Hyukmo Kang, Kyle Van Gorkom, Meghdoot Biswas, Daewook Kim, Ewan S. Douglas |   Continuous wavefront sensing benefits space observatories in on-orbit optical\\nperformance maintenance. To measure the phase of a wavefront, phase retrieval\\nis an attractive technique as it uses multiple point spread function (PSF)\\nimages that are acquired by the telescope itself without extra metrology\\nsystems nor complicated calibration. The focus diverse phase retrieval utilizes\\nPSFs from predetermined defocused positions to enhance the dynamic range of the\\nalgorithm. We describe an updated visible light active optics testbed with the\\naddition of a linear motorized focus stage. The performance of the phase\\nretrieval algorithm in broadband is tested under various cases. While broadband\\npass filters have advantages in higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the\\nperformance of phase retrieval can be restricted due to blurred image caused by\\ndiffraction and increased computing cost. We used multiple bandpass filters (10\\nnm, 88 nm, and 150 nm) and investigated effects of bandwidth on the accuracy\\nand required image acquisition conditions such as SNR, reaching accuracies\\nbelow 20 nm RMS wavefront error at the widest bandwidth. We also investigated\\nthe dynamic range of the phase retrieval algorithm depending on the bandwidth\\nand required amount of defocus to expand dynamic range. Finally, we simulated\\nthe continuous wavefront sensing and correction loop with a range of\\nstatistically generated representative telescope disturbance time series to\\ntest for edge cases.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10500v1) |\\n| The role of higher-order terms in trapped-ion quantum computing with\\n  magnetic gradient induced coupling | Sebastian Nagies, Kevin T. Geier, Javed Akram, Junichi Okamoto, Dimitris Badounas, Christof Wunderlich, Michael Johanning, Philipp Hauke |   Trapped-ion hardware based on the Magnetic Gradient Induced Coupling (MAGIC)\\nscheme is emerging as a promising platform for quantum computing. Nevertheless,\\nin this (as in any other) quantum-computing platform, many technical questions\\nstill have to be resolved before large-scale and error-tolerant applications\\nare possible. In this work, we present a thorough discussion of the\\ncontribution of higher-order terms to the MAGIC setup, which can occur due to\\nanharmonicities in the external potential of the ion crystal (e.g., through\\nCoulomb repulsion) or through curvature of the applied magnetic field. These\\nterms take the form of three-spin couplings as well as diverse terms that\\ncouple spins to phonons. We find that most of these are negligible in realistic\\nsituations, with only two contributions that need careful attention. First,\\nthere are parasitic longitudinal fields whose strength increases with chain\\nlength, but which can easily be compensated by a microwave detuning. Second,\\nanharmonicities of the Coulomb interaction can lead to well-known two-to-one\\nconversions of phonon excitations, which can be avoided if the phonons are\\nground-state cooled. Our detailed analysis constitutes an important\\ncontribution on the way of making magnetic-gradient trapped-ion quantum\\ntechnology fit for large-scale applications, and it may inspire new ways to\\npurposefully design interaction terms.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10498v1) |\\n| MusicLIME: Explainable Multimodal Music Understanding | Theodoros Sotirou, Vassilis Lyberatos, Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Stamou |   Multimodal models are critical for music understanding tasks, as they capture\\nthe complex interplay between audio and lyrics.

In this paper, we introduce MusicLIME, a model-agnostic\\nfeature importance explanation method designed for multimodal music models.\\nUnlike traditional unimodal methods, which analyze each modality separately\\nwithout considering the interaction between them, often leading to incomplete\\nor misleading explanations, MusicLIME reveals how audio and lyrical features\\ninteract and contribute to predictions, providing a holistic view of the\\nmodel's decision-making. Additionally, we enhance local explanations by\\naggregating them into global explanations, giving users a broader perspective\\nof model behavior. Through this work, we contribute to improving the\\ninterpretability of multimodal music models, empowering users to make informed\\nchoices, and fostering more equitable, fair, and transparent music\\nunderstanding systems.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10496v1) |\\n| Incorporating Classifier-Free Guidance in Diffusion Model-Based\\n  Recommendation | Noah Buchanan, Susan Gauch, Quan Mai |   This paper presents a diffusion-based recommender system that incorporates\\nclassifier-free guidance.

We curate an object state recognition\\ndataset ChangeIt-Frames, and evaluate nine open-source VLMs, including models\\ntrained with contrastive and generative objectives. We observe that while these\\nstate-of-the-art vision-language models can reliably perform object\\nrecognition, they consistently fail to accurately distinguish the objects'\\nphysical states. Through extensive experiments, we identify three areas for\\nimprovements for VLMs to better encode object states, namely the quality of\\nobject localization, the architecture to bind concepts to objects, and the\\nobjective to learn discriminative visual and language encoders on object\\nstates.

Ruan, Michael Eracleous, Daryl Haggard, Jessie C. Runnoe |   The physical processes that produce X-ray Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs)\\nrecently discovered from the nuclei of several low-redshift galaxies are\\nmysterious. Several pieces of observational evidence strongly suggest a link\\nbetween QPEs and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE). Previous studies also reveal\\nthat the morphologies of TDE host galaxies are highly concentrated, with high\\nSersic indicies, bulge-to-total light (B/T) ratios, and stellar surface mass\\ndensities relative to the broader galaxy population. We use these distinctive\\nproperties to test the link between QPEs and TDEs, by comparing these\\nparameters of QPE host galaxies to TDE host galaxies. We employ archival Legacy\\nSurvey images of a sample of 9 QPE host galaxies and a sample of 13 TDE host\\ngalaxies, and model their surface brightness profiles. We show that QPE host\\ngalaxies have high Sersic indices of ~3, high B/T ratios of ~0.5, and high\\nsurface mass densities of ~10^10 Msun kpc^-2. These properties are similar to\\nTDE host galaxies, but are in strong contrast to a mass- and redshift-matched\\ncontrol sample of galaxies. We also find tentative evidence that the central\\nblack holes in both QPE and TDE host galaxies are undermassive relative to\\ntheir stellar mass. The morphological similarities between QPE and TDE host\\ngalaxies at the population level add to the mounting evidence of a physical\\nlink between these phenomena, and favor QPE models that also invoke TDEs.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10486v1) |\\n| Tuning the Rate of Tightly Packed Systems To Produce Planet Occurrence\\n  Trends with Galactic Height | Sarah Ballard |   The formation of planetary systems has historically been considered in\\nisolation, decoupled from processes on galactic scales. Recent findings\\nemploying data from ESA's Gaia mission challenge this narrative, identifying\\ntrends in planet occurrence with galactic kinematics and stellar age. The\\nfindings indicate changes in planet occurrence over and above the predicted\\nchanges from metallicity variation within the Milky Way, so that changes to\\nstellar metallicity alone (long understood to be deterministic in planet\\noutcomes) cannot explain the trends entirely. The scope of potential factors\\ninfluencing planet formation has grown progressively wider, with accompanying\\ntheoretical support for galactic-scale influences upon planet formation. In\\nthis manuscript, we investigate specifically how changes to the rate of Systems\\nof Tightly-packed Inner Planets (STIPs) could manifest as a trend in planet\\noccurrence with galactic height. We focus our study upon M dwarf planetary\\nsystems for two reasons: first, they host STIPs at high rates, and secondly,\\ntheir longevity makes them useful probes for kinematic trends over Gyr. We\\nconsider two models for a varying STIP rate: one in which STIP likelihood is\\ndetermined by stellar age alone, irrespective of galactic time, and another in\\nwhich the STIP likelihood suddenly increased in recent galactic history. Both\\nmodels, which impose a higher STIP likelihood among younger stars, produce a\\nnegative gradient in planet occurrence with increasing height from the galactic\\nmidplane. We find that a step function model in which STIP likelihood increased\\nby a factor of several ~a few Gyr ago resembles an observed trend among FGK\\ndwarfs. We consider plausible physical mechanisms that could mimic the\\nhypothesized model, given known links between STIP occurrence and other stellar\\nand planetary properties.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10485v1) |\\n| XLM for Autonomous Driving Systems: A Comprehensive Review | Sonda Fourati, Wael Jaafar, Noura Baccar, Safwan Alfattani |   Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable proficiency in various\\ninformation-processing tasks.

These interactions have a particularly\\nprofound effect on excitation energies of molecules in complex environments,\\nespecially when the excitation involves a significant degree of charge\\nreorganisation. The direct reaction field (DRF) approach, which has seen a\\nrecent revival of interest, provides a powerful framework for describing these\\ninteractions in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models of\\nsystems, where a small subsystem of interest is described using quantum\\nchemical methods and the remainder is treated with a simple MM force field.

One of the classical and popular approaches is Local\\nStochastic Gradient Descent (Local SGD), characterized by multiple local\\nupdates before averaging, which is particularly useful in distributed\\nenvironments to reduce communication bottlenecks and improve scalability. A\\ntypical feature of this method is the dependence on the frequency of\\ncommunications.

As a natural consequence, subsequent studies include\\nthe assumption of a Lipschitz Hessian, as this indicates the similarity of the\\noptimized function to a quadratic one to some extent. However, in order to\\nextend the completeness of the Local SGD theory and unlock its potential, in\\nthis paper we abandon the Lipschitz Hessian assumption by introducing a new\\nconcept of $\\\\textit{approximate quadraticity}$.

Experiments on\\nPIE-Bench show that our proposal can improve the performance of DDIM inversion\\ndramatically without sacrificing efficiency.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10476v1) |\\n| Leadership and Engagement Dynamics in Legislative Twitter Networks:\\n  Statistical Analysis and Modeling | Carolina Luque, Juan Sosa |   In this manuscript, we analyze the interaction network on Twitter among\\nmembers of the 117th U.S. Congress to assess the visibility of political\\nleaders and explore how systemic properties and node attributes influence the\\nformation of legislative connections. We employ descriptive social network\\nstatistical methods, the exponential random graph model (ERGM), and the\\nstochastic block model (SBM) to evaluate the relative impact of network\\nsystemic properties, as well as institutional and personal traits, on the\\ngeneration of online relationships among legislators. Our findings reveal that\\nlegislative networks on social media platforms like Twitter tend to reinforce\\nthe leadership of dominant political actors rather than diminishing their\\ninfluence. However, we identify that these leadership roles can manifest in\\nvarious forms. Additionally, we highlight that online connections within\\nlegislative networks are influenced by both the systemic properties of the\\nnetwork and institutional characteristics.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10475v1) |\\n| MacDiff: Unified Skeleton Modeling with Masked Conditional Diffusion | Lehong Wu, Lilang Lin, Jiahang Zhang, Yiyang Ma, Jiaying Liu |   Self-supervised learning has proved effective for skeleton-based human action\\nunderstanding. However, previous works either rely on contrastive learning that\\nsuffers false negative problems or are based on reconstruction that learns too\\nmuch unessential low-level clues, leading to limited representations for\\ndownstream tasks. Recently, great advances have been made in generative\\nlearning, which is naturally a challenging yet meaningful pretext task to model\\nthe general underlying data distributions. However, the representation learning\\ncapacity of generative models is under-explored, especially for the skeletons\\nwith spacial sparsity and temporal redundancy. To this end, we propose Masked\\nConditional Diffusion (MacDiff) as a unified framework for human skeleton\\nmodeling. For the first time, we leverage diffusion models as effective\\nskeleton representation learners. Specifically, we train a diffusion decoder\\nconditioned on the representations extracted by a semantic encoder. Random\\nmasking is applied to encoder inputs to introduce a information bottleneck and\\nremove redundancy of skeletons. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that\\nour generative objective involves the contrastive learning objective which\\naligns the masked and noisy views. Meanwhile, it also enforces the\\nrepresentation to complement for the noisy view, leading to better\\ngeneralization performance. MacDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on\\nrepresentation learning benchmarks while maintaining the competence for\\ngenerative tasks. Moreover, we leverage the diffusion model for data\\naugmentation, significantly enhancing the fine-tuning performance in scenarios\\nwith scarce labeled data.

Hassan |   The proliferation of open Pre-trained Language Models (PTLMs) on model\\nregistry platforms like Hugging Face (HF) presents both opportunities and\\nchallenges for companies building products around them. Similar to traditional\\nsoftware dependencies, PTLMs continue to evolve after a release. However, the\\ncurrent state of release practices of PTLMs on model registry platforms are\\nplagued by a variety of inconsistencies, such as ambiguous naming conventions\\nand inaccessible model training documentation. Given the knowledge gap on\\ncurrent PTLM release practices, our empirical study uses a mixed-methods\\napproach to analyze the releases of 52,227 PTLMs on the most well-known model\\nregistry, HF. Our results reveal 148 different naming practices for PTLM\\nreleases, with 40.87% of changes to model weight files not represented in the\\nadopted name-based versioning practice or their documentation. In addition, we\\nidentified that the 52,227 PTLMs are derived from only 299 different base\\nmodels (the modified original models used to create 52,227 PTLMs), with\\nFine-tuning and Quantization being the most prevalent modification methods\\napplied to these base models. Significant gaps in release transparency, in\\nterms of training dataset specifications and model card availability, still\\nexist, highlighting the need for standardized documentation. While we\\nidentified a model naming practice explicitly differentiating between major and\\nminor PTLM releases, we did not find any significant difference in the types of\\nchanges that went into either type of releases, suggesting that major/minor\\nversion numbers for PTLMs often are chosen arbitrarily. Our findings provide\\nvaluable insights to improve PTLM release practices, nudging the field towards\\nmore formal semantic versioning practices.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10472v1) |\\n| Real-Time Whole-Body Control of Legged Robots with Model-Predictive Path\\n  Integral Control | Juan Alvarez-Padilla, John Z.

F. Lizarraga, Flavia M. D. Marquitti, Marcus A. M. de Aguiar |   We investigate the role of assortative mating in speciation using the\\nsympatric model of Derrida and Higgs. The model explores the idea that genetic\\ndifferences create incompatibilities between individuals, preventing mating if\\nthe number of such differences is too large. Speciation, however, only happens\\nin this mating system if the number of genes is large. Here we show that\\nspeciation with small genome sizes can occur if assortative mating is\\nintroduced. In our model individuals are represented by three chromosomes: one\\nresponsible for reproductive compatibility, one for coding the trait on which\\nassortativity will operate, and a neutral chromosome. Reproduction is possible\\nif individuals are genetically similar with respect to the first chromosome,\\nbut among these compatible mating partners, the one with the most similar trait\\ncoded by the second chromosome is selected. We show that this type of\\nassortativity facilitates speciation, which can happen with a small number of\\ngenes in the first chromosome. Species, classified according to reproductive\\nisolation, dictated by the first chromosome, can display different traits\\nvalues, as measured by the second and the third chromosomes. Therefore, species\\ncan also be identified based on similarity of the neutral trait, which works as\\na proxy for reproductive isolation.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10466v1) |\\n| A stabilized total pressure-formulation of the Biot's poroelasticity\\n  equations in frequency domain: numerical analysis and applications | Cristian C\\u00e1rcamo, Alfonso Caiazzo, Felipe Galarce, Joaqu\\u00edn Mura |   This work focuses on the numerical solution of the dynamics of a poroelastic\\nmaterial in the frequency domain.

Lastly, we show the application for the simulation of brain\\nelastography on a realistic brain geometry obtained from medical imaging.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10465v1) |\\n| New Direct Sum Tests | Alek Westover, Edward Yu, Kai Zheng |   A function $f:[n]^{d} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{F}_2$ is a \\\\defn{direct sum} if there are\\nfunctions $L_i:[n]\\\\to \\\\mathbb{F}_2$ such that ${f(x) = \\\\sum_{i}L_i(x_i)}$. In\\nthis work we give multiple results related to the property testing of direct\\nsums.\\n  Our first result concerns a test proposed by Dinur and Golubev in 2019. We\\ncall their test the Diamond test and show that it is indeed a direct sum\\ntester. More specifically, we show that if a function $f$ is $\\\\epsilon$-far\\nfrom being a direct sum function, then the Diamond test rejects $f$ with\\nprobability at least $\\\\Omega_{n,\\\\epsilon}(1)$. Even in the case of $n = 2$, the\\nDiamond test is, to the best of our knowledge, novel and yields a new tester\\nfor the classic property of affinity.\\n  Apart from the Diamond test, we also analyze a broad family of direct sum\\ntests, which at a high level, run an arbitrary affinity test on the restriction\\nof $f$ to a random hypercube inside of $[n]^d$.

Recently,\\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a compelling alternative,\\nutilizing highly flexible learnable activation functions directly on network\\nedges, a departure from the neuron-centric approach of MLPs. However, KANs\\nsignificantly increase the number of learnable parameters, raising concerns\\nabout their effectiveness in data-scarce environments. This paper presents a\\ncomprehensive comparative study of MLPs and KANs from both algorithmic and\\nexperimental perspectives, with a focus on low-data regimes. We introduce an\\neffective technique for designing MLPs with unique, parameterized activation\\nfunctions for each neuron, enabling a more balanced comparison with KANs. Using\\nempirical evaluations on simulated data and two real-world data sets from\\nmedicine and engineering, we explore the trade-offs between model complexity\\nand accuracy, with particular attention to the role of network depth. Our\\nfindings show that MLPs with individualized activation functions achieve\\nsignificantly higher predictive accuracy with only a modest increase in\\nparameters, especially when the sample size is limited to around one hundred.\\nFor example, in a three-class classification problem within additive\\nmanufacturing, MLPs achieve a median accuracy of 0.91, significantly\\noutperforming KANs, which only reach a median accuracy of 0.53 with default\\nhyperparameters. These results offer valuable insights into the impact of\\nactivation function selection in neural networks.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10463v1) |\\n| Effects of synapse location, delay and background stochastic activity on\\n  synchronising hippocampal CA1 neurons | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore |   We study the synchronisation of neurons in a realistic model under the\\nHodgkin-Huxley dynamics. To focus on the role of the different locations of the\\nexcitatory synapses, we use two identical neurons where the set of input\\nsignals is grouped at two different distances from the soma. The system is\\nintended to represent a CA1 hippocampal neuron in which the synapses arriving\\nfrom the CA3 neurons of the trisynaptic pathway appear to be localised in the\\napical dendritic region and are, in principle, either proximal or distal to the\\nsoma. Synchronisation is studied using a specifically defined spiking\\ncorrelation function as a function of various parameters such as the distance\\nfrom the soma of one of the synaptic groups, the inhibition weight and the\\nassociated activation delay. We found that the neurons' spiking activity\\ndepends nonmonotonically on the relative dendritic location of the synapses and\\ntheir inhibitory weight, whereas the synchronisation measure always decreases\\nwith inhibition, and strongly depends on its activation time delay. The\\nbackground activity on the somas results essentially independent on the\\nfluctuation intensity and strongly support the importance of the balance\\nbetween inhibition and excitation for neuronal synchronization.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10460v1) |\\n| Efficiently Crowdsourcing Visual Importance with Punch-Hole Annotation | Minsuk Chang, Soohyun Lee, Aeri Cho, Hyeon Jeon, Seokhyeon Park, Cindy Xiong Bearfield, Jinwook Seo |   We introduce a novel crowdsourcing method for identifying important areas in\\ngraphical images through punch-hole labeling. Traditional methods, such as gaze\\ntrackers and mouse-based annotations, which generate continuous data, can be\\nimpractical in crowdsourcing scenarios. They require many participants, and the\\noutcome data can be noisy. In contrast, our method first segments the graphical\\nimage with a grid and drops a portion of the patches (punch holes). Then, we\\niteratively ask the labeler to validate each annotation with holes, narrowing\\ndown the annotation only having the most important area. This approach aims to\\nreduce annotation noise in crowdsourcing by standardizing the annotations while\\nenhancing labeling efficiency and reliability. Preliminary findings from\\nfundamental charts demonstrate that punch-hole labeling can effectively\\npinpoint critical regions. This also highlights its potential for broader\\napplication in visualization research, particularly in studying large-scale\\nusers' graphical perception. Our future work aims to enhance the algorithm to\\nachieve faster labeling speed and prove its utility through large-scale\\nexperiments.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10459v1) |\\n| Full distribution of local observables in an exactly solvable current\\n  carrying steady states of a driven XXZ chain | Sandipan Manna, G J Sreejith |   Current carrying steady states of interacting spins chains exhibit rich\\nstructures generated through an interplay of current induced correlations and\\nenergetic constraints from the Hamiltonian. The XXZ spin chain when coupled to\\nmaximally polarizing Lindblad terms admits an exact solution in a matrix\\nproduct state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations\\nand distributions of simple local spin observables in the non equilibrium\\nsteady state (NESS). We present exact expressions for spin correlators, entropy\\nper site, cumulant generating functions for distributions of local observables\\nin the XX limit (Ising anisotropy $\\\\Delta=0$). Further, we use the exact MPS\\nsolution in systems with $\\\\Delta>0$, to numerically exactly calculate the\\nentropy, correlations, as well as distributions of spin observables in blocks\\nas large as $n\\\\sim 200$ sites allowing an estimation of the rate functions. The\\n$z$ magnetization distribution is consistant with short range spin correlations\\nin the $z$ direction while the $x$-magnetization shows a double peak structure\\nat larger $\\\\Delta$ suggesting short range ferromagnetic ordering.

Bottke, Robert Jedicke, Shantanu Naidu, Steven R. Chesley, Davide Farnocchia, Paul W. Chodas |   This work is dedicated to debias the Near-Earth Objects (NEO) population\\nbased on observations from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System\\n(ATLAS) telescopes. We have applied similar methods used to develop the\\nrecently released NEO model generator (NEOMOD), once debiasing the NEO\\npopulation using data from Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) G96 telescope. ATLAS is\\ncomposed of four different telescopes. We first analyzed observational data\\nfrom each of all four telescopes separately and later combined them. Our\\nresults highlight main differences between CSS and ATLAS, e.g., sky coverage\\nand survey power at debiasing the NEO population. ATLAS has a much larger sky\\ncoverage than CSS, allowing it to find bright NEOs that would be constantly\\n\\\"hiding\\\" from CSS. Consequently, ATLAS is more powerful than CSS at debiasing\\nthe NEO population for H $\\\\lesssim$ 19. With its intrinsically greater\\nsensitivity and emphasis on observing near opposition, CSS excels in the\\ndebiasing of smaller objects. ATLAS, as an all sky survey designed to find\\nimminent hazardous objects, necessarily spends a significant fraction of time\\nlooking at places on the sky where objects do not appear, reducing its power\\nfor debiasing the population of small objects. We estimate a NEO population\\ncompleteness of $\\\\approx$ 88%$^{+3\\\\%}_{-2\\\\%}$ for H $<$ 17.75 and $\\\\approx$\\n36%$^{+1\\\\%}_{-1\\\\%}$ for H $<$ 22.25.

Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited\\nfocus on developing and evaluating explainable neural-based graph generative\\nmodels specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we\\npropose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE\\nextracts node-level representations that express node memberships over distinct\\nextreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is\\nachieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its\\npolarization.

Recent advancements in markerless pose\\nestimation methods have eliminated the need for time-consuming physical setups\\nfor camera-to-robot calibration. While the existing markerless pose estimation\\nmethods have demonstrated impressive accuracy without the need for cumbersome\\nsetups, they rely on the assumption that all the robot joints are visible\\nwithin the camera's field of view.

The two spin-flop phases are distinguished by their out-of-plane\\nspin components which can be either antiparallel or parallel, thus dubbing\\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) spin-flop phases, respectively.\\nWe map out topological phase diagrams for both phases, revealing a rich pattern\\nof the Chern number over exchange parameters and magnetic field. We\\nanalytically calculate the boundaries of topological phase transitions when the\\nmagnetic field is along the $a$ and $b$ directions. We find that the thermal\\nHall conductivity and its derivative display contrasting behaviors when\\ncrossing different topological phase transitions. The striking difference of\\nthe two phases lies in that when the magnetic field is along the $b$ direction,\\ntopological magnons are totally absent in the AFM spin-flop phase, while they\\ncan survive in the FM analogue in certain parameter regions.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10439v1) |\\n| A functorial approach to $n$-abelian categories | Vitor Gulisz |   We develop a functorial approach to the study of $n$-abelian categories by\\nreformulating their axioms in terms of their categories of finitely presented\\nfunctors.

The vast majority of\\nenergy-preserving reduced-order methods use symplectic Galerkin projection to\\nconstruct reduced-order Hamiltonian models by projecting the full models onto a\\nsymplectic subspace. However, symplectic projection requires the existence of\\nfully discrete operators, and in many cases, such as black-box PDE solvers,\\nthese operators are inaccessible. In this work, we propose an energy-preserving\\nmachine learning method that can infer the dynamics of the given PDE using data\\nonly, so that the proposed framework does not depend on the fully discrete\\noperators. In this context, the proposed method is non-intrusive. The proposed\\nmethod is grey box in the sense that it requires only some basic knowledge of\\nthe multi-symplectic model at the partial differential equation level. We prove\\nthat the proposed method satisfies spatially discrete local energy conservation\\nand preserves the multi-symplectic conservation laws. We test our method on the\\nlinear wave equation, the Korteweg-de Vries equation, and the\\nZakharov-Kuznetsov equation.

Papoutsis, I. E. Papadakis, C. Panagiotou, M. Dov\\u010diak, E. Kammoun |   Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to be variable across all\\nwavelengths. Significant observational efforts have been invested in the last\\ndecade in studying their ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability. Long and\\ndensely sampled, multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns of numerous Seyfert\\ngalaxies have been conducted with the aim of determining the X-ray/UV/optical\\ncontinuum time lags. Time-lag studies can be used to constrain theoretical\\nmodels. The observed time lags can be explained by thermal reprocessing of the\\nX-rays illuminating the accretion disc (known as the X-ray reverberation\\nmodel). However, the observed light curves contain more information that can be\\nused to further constrain physical models. Our primary objective is to\\ninvestigate whether, in addition to time lags, the X-ray reverberation model\\ncan also explain the UV/optical variability amplitude of nearby Seyferts. To do\\nthis, we measured the excess variance of four sources (namely Mrk 509, NGC\\n4151, NGC 2617, and Mrk 142) as a function of wavelength using data from\\narchival long, multi-wavelength campaigns with Swift, and ground-based\\ntelescopes. We also computed the model excess variance in the case of the X-ray\\nreverberation model by determining the disc's transfer function and assuming a\\nbending power law for the X-ray power spectrum. We tested the validity of the\\nmodel by comparing the measured and model variances for a range of accretion\\nrates and X-ray source heights. We conclude that the X-ray thermal\\nreverberation model can fit both the continuum, UV/optical time lags, as well\\nas the variance in these AGNs, for the same physical parameters. Our results\\nsuggest that the accretion disc is constant and that all the observed\\nUV/optical variations, on timescales of days and up to a few weeks, can be\\nfully explained by the variable X-rays as they illuminate the accretion disc.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10417v1) |\\n| Local central limit theorem for Mallows measure | Alexey Bufetov, Kailun Chen |   We study the statistics of the Mallows measure on permutations in the limit\\npioneered by Starr (2009).

In meiosis II mouse oocytes (developing egg cells) awaiting\\nfertilisation, the spindle, which is the protein structure responsible for\\ndividing genetic material in a cell, must maintain its position near the cell\\ncortex (the thin actin network bound to the cell membrane) for many hours.\\nHowever, the cytoplasmic streaming that accompanies this stable positioning\\nwould intuitively appear to destabilise the spindle position.

Dejrah |   We focus on the inflationary predictions of $\\\\beta$-exponential potential\\nmodels, in which the inflaton is a representation of the field delineating the\\nsize of extra-dimension. Since it offers a well-motivated starting point for\\nthe study of physics at very high energies, we incorporate an $R^2$ term in the\\nPalatini gravity. In addition, afterward the inflation, the inflaton oscillates\\nabout the minimum of the inflation potential, and reheats the universe. This\\noccurs during the reheating phase, at which the inflaton decays into the\\nstandard model particles, which fill the universe. We extend our examination by\\nconsidering the reheating effects on inflationary observables by employing the\\ndifferent scenarios of the reheat temperature. Supposing the standard thermal\\nhistory after inflation, we display the inflationary predictions, $n_s, r,\\n\\\\mathrm{d}n_s/\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\ln k$ of $\\\\beta$-exponential potential with minimal\\ncoupling in Palatini $R^2$ gravity.

The majority of work that has been\\ndone is focused on Deep Learning (DL) based approaches. However, with the\\nemergence of new algorithms such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm, there\\nis growing interest in exploring alternative approaches that may offer unique\\nadvantages in certain domains or applications. One of these domains is\\nFederated Learning (FL), in which users privacy is of utmost importance. Due to\\nits novelty, FL has seen a surge in the incorporation of personalization\\ntechniques to enhance model accuracy while maintaining user privacy under\\npersonalized conditions. In this work, we propose a novel approach dubbed TPFL:\\nTsetlin-Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into\\nclusters based on their confidence towards a specific class. In this way,\\nclustering can benefit from two key advantages. Firstly, clients share only\\nwhat they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight\\naggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been\\nenough during the training. This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are\\nnon-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID). Secondly, by sharing\\nonly weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially\\nreduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication\\ncost. The results of TPFL demonstrated the highest accuracy on three different\\ndatasets; namely MNIST, FashionMNIST and FEMNIST.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10392v1) |\\n| Prompt-and-Transfer: Dynamic Class-aware Enhancement for Few-shot\\n  Segmentation | Hanbo Bi, Yingchao Feng, Wenhui Diao, Peijin Wang, Yongqiang Mao, Kun Fu, Hongqi Wang, Xian Sun |   For more efficient generalization to unseen domains (classes), most Few-shot\\nSegmentation (FSS) would directly exploit pre-trained encoders and only\\nfine-tune the decoder, especially in the current era of large models. However,\\nsuch fixed feature encoders tend to be class-agnostic, inevitably activating\\nobjects that are irrelevant to the target class. In contrast, humans can\\neffortlessly focus on specific objects in the line of sight. This paper mimics\\nthe visual perception pattern of human beings and proposes a novel and powerful\\nprompt-driven scheme, called ``Prompt and Transfer\\\" (PAT), which constructs a\\ndynamic class-aware prompting paradigm to tune the encoder for focusing on the\\ninterested object (target class) in the current task. Three key points are\\nelaborated to enhance the prompting: 1) Cross-modal linguistic information is\\nintroduced to initialize prompts for each task. 2) Semantic Prompt Transfer\\n(SPT) that precisely transfers the class-specific semantics within the images\\nto prompts. 3) Part Mask Generator (PMG) that works in conjunction with SPT to\\nadaptively generate different but complementary part prompts for different\\nindividuals. Surprisingly, PAT achieves competitive performance on 4 different\\ntasks including standard FSS, Cross-domain FSS (e.g., CV, medical, and remote\\nsensing domains), Weak-label FSS, and Zero-shot Segmentation, setting new\\nstate-of-the-arts on 11 benchmarks.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10389v1) |\\n| Revising the Structure of Recurrent Neural Networks to Eliminate\\n  Numerical Derivatives in Forming Physics Informed Loss Terms with Respect to\\n  Time | Mahyar Jahani-nasab, Mohamad Ali Bijarchi |   Solving unsteady partial differential equations (PDEs) using recurrent neural\\nnetworks (RNNs) typically requires numerical derivatives between each block of\\nthe RNN to form the physics informed loss function. However, this introduces\\nthe complexities of numerical derivatives into the training process of these\\nmodels. In this study, we propose modifying the structure of the traditional\\nRNN to enable the prediction of each block over a time interval, making it\\npossible to calculate the derivative of the output with respect to time using\\nthe backpropagation algorithm. To achieve this, the time intervals of these\\nblocks are overlapped, defining a mutual loss function between them.\\nAdditionally, the employment of conditional hidden states enables us to achieve\\na unique solution for each block.

Our results\\ndemonstrate that MI-RNN can find the exact solution more accurately compared to\\nexisting RNN models. For instance, in the second problem, MI-RNN achieved one\\norder of magnitude less relative error compared to the RNN model with numerical\\nderivatives.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10388v1) |\\n| Sharp decay rate for eigenfunctions of perturbed periodic Schr\\u00f6dinger\\n  operators | Wencai Liu, Rodrigo Matos, John N.

Most of the state-of-the-art architectures\\nuse transformers or diffusion-based models to perform this task, despite the\\nheavy computational burden that they require. In particular, transformers use\\nself- and cross-attention layers which have large memory footprint, while\\ndiffusion models require high inference time. To overcome the above, this paper\\nexplores a novel design of Mamba, an emergent State-Space Model (SSM), called\\nMamba-ST, to perform style transfer. To do so, we adapt Mamba linear equation\\nto simulate the behavior of cross-attention layers, which are able to combine\\ntwo separate embeddings into a single output, but drastically reducing memory\\nusage and time complexity. We modified the Mamba's inner equations so to accept\\ninputs from, and combine, two separate data streams.

Maiti |   We present a comprehensive study on enhancing the thermoelectric (TE)\\nperformance of bilayer graphene (BLG) through irradiation with arbitrarily\\npolarized light, focusing on $AA$- and $AB$-stacked configurations with zigzag\\nedges. Utilizing a combination of tight-binding theory and density functional\\ntheory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on\\nelectronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the\\nelectronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function,\\nwhich significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the\\noverall {\\\\it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT\\ncalculations reveal that $AB$-stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal\\nconductivity compared to $AA$-stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic\\nscattering and phonon group velocity.

This study introduces\\na novel statistical approach, TAR4C, to dissect causal interactions in\\nmultichannel EEG recordings. TAR4C uses the threshold autoregressive model to\\ndescribe the causal interaction between nodes or clusters of nodes in a brain\\nnetwork. The perspective involves testing whether one node, which may represent\\na brain region, can control the dynamics of the other. The node that has such\\nan impact on the other is called a threshold variable and can be classified as\\na causative because its functionality is the leading source operating as an\\ninstantaneous switching mechanism that regulates the time-varying\\nautoregressive structure of the other. This statistical concept is commonly\\nreferred to as threshold non-linearity. Once threshold non-linearity has been\\nverified between a pair of nodes, the subsequent essential facet of TAR\\nmodeling is to assess the predictive ability of the causal node for the current\\nactivity on the other and represent causal interactions in autoregressive\\nterms. This predictive ability is what underlies Granger causality. The TAR4C\\napproach can discover non-linear and time-dependent causal interactions without\\nnegating the G-causality perspective. The efficacy of the proposed approach is\\nexemplified by analyzing the EEG signals recorded during the motor\\nmovement/imagery experiment. The similarities and differences between the\\ncausal interactions manifesting during the execution and the imagery of a given\\nmotor movement are demonstrated by analyzing EEG recordings from multiple\\nsubjects.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10374v1) |\\n| Instigating Cooperation among LLM Agents Using Adaptive Information\\n  Modulation | Qiliang Chen,  Alireza,  Ilami, Nunzio Lore, Babak Heydari |   This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for\\nhuman strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these\\nagents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments.

Integral-field\\nobservations with a high spectral resolution allow us to robustly determine\\ntheir low velocity dispersions ($\\\\sim25$ km s$^{-1}$) and higher-order\\nkinematic moments out to the half-light radius. We find the dEs exhibit a\\ndiversity in ages with the younger dEs being less enhanced than the older,\\nsuggesting a complex star formation history for those dEs that recently entered\\nVirgo while others have been quenched shortly after reionization.\\nOrbit-superposition modeling allowed us to recover viewing angles, stellar\\nmass-to-light ratios (with gradients), as well as the intrinsic orbit\\nstructure. We find that the angular momentum of the dEs is strongly suppressed\\ncompared to ordinary early-type galaxies and correlates with the environment.\\nFlattened dEs are so because of a suppressed kinetic energy perpendicular to\\ntheir equatorial plane. Combining population and dynamical modeling results, we\\nfind an age-dependent stellar initial mass function (IMF) or, alternatively,\\nevidence for a more extended star formation history for those galaxies that\\nhave had higher initial mass and/or inhabited lower density environments. dEs\\nappear to have a spatially homogeneous stellar structure but the state they\\nwere `frozen' in as they stopped forming stars varies dramatically according to\\ntheir initial conditions.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10518v1) |\\n| RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Vector\\n  Retrieval | Di Liu, Meng Chen, Baotong Lu, Huiqiang Jiang, Zhenhua Han, Qianxi Zhang, Qi Chen, Chengruidong Zhang, Bailu Ding, Kai Zhang, Chen Chen, Fan Yang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu |   Transformer-based large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly important\\nin various domains. However, the quadratic time complexity of attention\\noperation poses a significant challenge for scaling to longer contexts due to\\nthe extremely high inference latency and GPU memory consumption for caching\\nkey-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free\\napproach to accelerate attention computation. To leverage the dynamic sparse\\nproperty of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor\\nsearch (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most\\nrelevant ones via vector search during generation. Due to the\\nout-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors, off-the-shelf\\nANNS indexes still need to scan O(N) (usually 30% of all keys) data for\\naccurate retrieval, which fails to exploit the high sparsity.\\nRetrievalAttention first identifies the OOD challenge of ANNS-based attention,\\nand addresses it via an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt\\nto queries and only access 1--3% of data, thus achieving a sub-linear time\\ncomplexity. RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of\\nlong-context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the\\nmodel accuracy. Especially, RetrievalAttention only needs 16GB GPU memory for\\nserving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating\\none token in 0.188 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB).\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516v1) |\\n| An Efficient Self-Learning Framework For Interactive Spoken Dialog\\n  Systems | Hitesh Tulsiani, David M. Chan, Shalini Ghosh, Garima Lalwani, Prabhat Pandey, Ankish Bansal, Sri Garimella, Ariya Rastrow, Bj\\u00f6rn Hoffmeister |   Dialog systems, such as voice assistants, are expected to engage with users\\nin complex, evolving conversations. Unfortunately, traditional automatic speech\\nrecognition (ASR) systems deployed in such applications are usually trained to\\nrecognize each turn independently and lack the ability to adapt to the\\nconversational context or incorporate user feedback. In this work, we introduce\\na general framework for ASR in dialog systems that can go beyond learning from\\nsingle-turn utterances and learn over time how to adapt to both explicit\\nsupervision and implicit user feedback present in multi-turn conversations. We\\naccomplish that by leveraging advances in student-teacher learning and\\ncontext-aware dialog processing, and designing contrastive self-supervision\\napproaches with Ohm, a new online hard-negative mining approach. We show that\\nleveraging our new framework compared to traditional training leads to relative\\nWER reductions of close to 10% in real-world dialog systems, and up to 26% on\\npublic synthetic data.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10515v1) |\\n| Constraints on axions from patchy screening of the cosmic microwave\\n  background | Samuel Goldstein, Fiona McCarthy, Cristina Mondino, J.

Our results demonstrate\\nthat resistivity can significantly influence the development of\\nmagnetohydrodynamic instabilities, resulting in markedly different magnetic\\nfield geometries. Additionally, resistivity suppresses the growth of these\\ninstabilities, leading to a reduction in the amplitude of emitted gravitational\\nwaves.

We propose an LLM-based translation\\nscheme that improves the success rate of translating large-scale C code into\\ncompilable Rust code. Our approach involves three key techniques: (1)\\npre-processing the C code to better align its structure and expressions with\\nRust, (2) segmenting the code into optimally sized translation units to avoid\\nexceeding the LLM's context window limits, and (3) iteratively compiling and\\nrepairing errors while maintaining consistency between translation units using\\ncontext-supplementing prompts. Compilation success is an essential first step\\nin achieving functional equivalence, as only compilable code can be further\\ntested. In experiments with 20 benchmark C programs, including those exceeding\\n4 kilo lines of code, we successfully translated all programs into compilable\\nRust code without losing corresponding parts of the original code.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10506v1) |\\n| Machine Learning Optimization of non-Kasha Behavior and of Transient\\n  Dynamics in Model Retinal Isomerization | Davinder Singh, Chern Chuang, Paul Brumer |   Designing a model of retinal isomerization in Rhodopsin, the first step in\\nvision, that accounts for both experimental transient and stationary state\\nobservables is challenging. Here, multi-objective Bayesian optimization is\\nemployed to refine the parameters of a minimal two-state-two-mode (TM) model\\ndescribing the photoisomerization of retinal in Rhodopsin. With an appropriate\\nselection of objectives, the optimized retinal model predicts excitation\\nwavelength-dependent fluorescence spectra that closely align with\\nexperimentally observed non-Kasha behavior in the non-equilibrium steady state.\\nFurther, adjustments to the potential energy surface within the TM model reduce\\nthe discrepancies across the time domain.

Existing works often rely\\non local interpretability methods, failing to provide comprehensive\\nexplanations of the overall mechanism behind each label prediction within a\\nmultilabel set. We propose a mechanistic interpretability module called\\nDIctionary Label Attention (\\\\method) that disentangles uninterpretable dense\\nembeddings into a sparse embedding space, where each nonzero element (a\\ndictionary feature) represents a globally learned medical concept. Through\\nhuman evaluations, we show that our sparse embeddings are more human\\nunderstandable than its dense counterparts by at least 50 percent. Our\\nautomated dictionary feature identification pipeline, leveraging large language\\nmodels (LLMs), uncovers thousands of learned medical concepts by examining and\\nsummarizing the highest activating tokens for each dictionary feature. We\\nrepresent the relationships between dictionary features and medical codes\\nthrough a sparse interpretable matrix, enhancing the mechanistic and global\\nunderstanding of the model's predictions while maintaining competitive\\nperformance and scalability without extensive human annotation.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10504v1) |\\n| Causal Language Modeling Can Elicit Search and Reasoning Capabilities on\\n  Logic Puzzles | Kulin Shah, Nishanth Dikkala, Xin Wang, Rina Panigrahy |   Causal language modeling using the Transformer architecture has yielded\\nremarkable capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) over the last few\\nyears. However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning\\ncapabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this\\nwork, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as\\nsolving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to\\nsearch over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then\\napply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the\\napplication of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in\\na cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases,\\nmultiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We\\nobserve that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn\\nto solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21\\\\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly)\\nwhen trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that\\ntraining Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and\\nwithout such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis\\nto Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves\\n$92.04 \\\\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal\\nrepresentations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear\\nprobing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any\\ngiven cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine\\nimplicit in the Transformer weights.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10502v1) |\\n| Alignment with nonlinear velocity couplings: collision-avoidance and\\n  micro-to-macro mean-field limits | Young-Pil Choi, Micha\\u0142 Fabisiak, Jan Peszek |   We investigate the pressureless fractional Euler-alignment system with\\nnonlinear velocity couplings, referred to as the $p$-Euler-alignment system.\\nThis model features a nonlinear velocity alignment force, interpreted as a\\ndensity-weighted fractional $p$-Laplacian when the singularity parameter\\n$\\\\alpha$ exceeds the spatial dimension $d$. Our primary goal is to establish\\nthe existence of solutions for strongly singular interactions ($\\\\alpha \\\\ge d$)\\nand compactly supported initial conditions. We construct solutions as\\nmean-field limits of empirical measures from a kinetic variant of the\\n$p$-Euler-alignment system. Specifically, we show that a sequence of empirical\\nmeasures converges to a finite Radon measure, whose local density and velocity\\nsatisfy the $p$-Euler-alignment system. Our results are the first to prove the\\nexistence of solutions to this system in multi-dimensional settings without\\nsignificant initial data restrictions, covering both nonlinear ($p>2$) and\\nlinear ($p=2$) cases. Additionally, we establish global existence, uniqueness,\\nand collision avoidance for the corresponding particle ODE system under\\nnon-collisional initial conditions, extending previous results for $1 \\\\le p \\\\le\\n\\\\alpha + 2$.

Douglas |   Continuous wavefront sensing benefits space observatories in on-orbit optical\\nperformance maintenance. To measure the phase of a wavefront, phase retrieval\\nis an attractive technique as it uses multiple point spread function (PSF)\\nimages that are acquired by the telescope itself without extra metrology\\nsystems nor complicated calibration. The focus diverse phase retrieval utilizes\\nPSFs from predetermined defocused positions to enhance the dynamic range of the\\nalgorithm. We describe an updated visible light active optics testbed with the\\naddition of a linear motorized focus stage. The performance of the phase\\nretrieval algorithm in broadband is tested under various cases. While broadband\\npass filters have advantages in higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the\\nperformance of phase retrieval can be restricted due to blurred image caused by\\ndiffraction and increased computing cost. We used multiple bandpass filters (10\\nnm, 88 nm, and 150 nm) and investigated effects of bandwidth on the accuracy\\nand required image acquisition conditions such as SNR, reaching accuracies\\nbelow 20 nm RMS wavefront error at the widest bandwidth. We also investigated\\nthe dynamic range of the phase retrieval algorithm depending on the bandwidth\\nand required amount of defocus to expand dynamic range. Finally, we simulated\\nthe continuous wavefront sensing and correction loop with a range of\\nstatistically generated representative telescope disturbance time series to\\ntest for edge cases.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10500v1) |\\n| The role of higher-order terms in trapped-ion quantum computing with\\n  magnetic gradient induced coupling | Sebastian Nagies, Kevin T. Geier, Javed Akram, Junichi Okamoto, Dimitris Badounas, Christof Wunderlich, Michael Johanning, Philipp Hauke |   Trapped-ion hardware based on the Magnetic Gradient Induced Coupling (MAGIC)\\nscheme is emerging as a promising platform for quantum computing. Nevertheless,\\nin this (as in any other) quantum-computing platform, many technical questions\\nstill have to be resolved before large-scale and error-tolerant applications\\nare possible. In this work, we present a thorough discussion of the\\ncontribution of higher-order terms to the MAGIC setup, which can occur due to\\nanharmonicities in the external potential of the ion crystal (e.g., through\\nCoulomb repulsion) or through curvature of the applied magnetic field. These\\nterms take the form of three-spin couplings as well as diverse terms that\\ncouple spins to phonons. We find that most of these are negligible in realistic\\nsituations, with only two contributions that need careful attention. First,\\nthere are parasitic longitudinal fields whose strength increases with chain\\nlength, but which can easily be compensated by a microwave detuning. Second,\\nanharmonicities of the Coulomb interaction can lead to well-known two-to-one\\nconversions of phonon excitations, which can be avoided if the phonons are\\nground-state cooled. Our detailed analysis constitutes an important\\ncontribution on the way of making magnetic-gradient trapped-ion quantum\\ntechnology fit for large-scale applications, and it may inspire new ways to\\npurposefully design interaction terms.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10498v1) |\\n| MusicLIME: Explainable Multimodal Music Understanding | Theodoros Sotirou, Vassilis Lyberatos, Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Stamou |   Multimodal models are critical for music understanding tasks, as they capture\\nthe complex interplay between audio and lyrics.

In this paper, we introduce MusicLIME, a model-agnostic\\nfeature importance explanation method designed for multimodal music models.\\nUnlike traditional unimodal methods, which analyze each modality separately\\nwithout considering the interaction between them, often leading to incomplete\\nor misleading explanations, MusicLIME reveals how audio and lyrical features\\ninteract and contribute to predictions, providing a holistic view of the\\nmodel's decision-making. Additionally, we enhance local explanations by\\naggregating them into global explanations, giving users a broader perspective\\nof model behavior.

Ruan, Michael Eracleous, Daryl Haggard, Jessie C. Runnoe |   The physical processes that produce X-ray Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs)\\nrecently discovered from the nuclei of several low-redshift galaxies are\\nmysterious. Several pieces of observational evidence strongly suggest a link\\nbetween QPEs and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE). Previous studies also reveal\\nthat the morphologies of TDE host galaxies are highly concentrated, with high\\nSersic indicies, bulge-to-total light (B/T) ratios, and stellar surface mass\\ndensities relative to the broader galaxy population. We use these distinctive\\nproperties to test the link between QPEs and TDEs, by comparing these\\nparameters of QPE host galaxies to TDE host galaxies. We employ archival Legacy\\nSurvey images of a sample of 9 QPE host galaxies and a sample of 13 TDE host\\ngalaxies, and model their surface brightness profiles. We show that QPE host\\ngalaxies have high Sersic indices of ~3, high B/T ratios of ~0.5, and high\\nsurface mass densities of ~10^10 Msun kpc^-2. These properties are similar to\\nTDE host galaxies, but are in strong contrast to a mass- and redshift-matched\\ncontrol sample of galaxies. We also find tentative evidence that the central\\nblack holes in both QPE and TDE host galaxies are undermassive relative to\\ntheir stellar mass. The morphological similarities between QPE and TDE host\\ngalaxies at the population level add to the mounting evidence of a physical\\nlink between these phenomena, and favor QPE models that also invoke TDEs.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10486v1) |\\n| Tuning the Rate of Tightly Packed Systems To Produce Planet Occurrence\\n  Trends with Galactic Height | Sarah Ballard |   The formation of planetary systems has historically been considered in\\nisolation, decoupled from processes on galactic scales. Recent findings\\nemploying data from ESA's Gaia mission challenge this narrative, identifying\\ntrends in planet occurrence with galactic kinematics and stellar age. The\\nfindings indicate changes in planet occurrence over and above the predicted\\nchanges from metallicity variation within the Milky Way, so that changes to\\nstellar metallicity alone (long understood to be deterministic in planet\\noutcomes) cannot explain the trends entirely. The scope of potential factors\\ninfluencing planet formation has grown progressively wider, with accompanying\\ntheoretical support for galactic-scale influences upon planet formation. In\\nthis manuscript, we investigate specifically how changes to the rate of Systems\\nof Tightly-packed Inner Planets (STIPs) could manifest as a trend in planet\\noccurrence with galactic height. We focus our study upon M dwarf planetary\\nsystems for two reasons: first, they host STIPs at high rates, and secondly,\\ntheir longevity makes them useful probes for kinematic trends over Gyr. We\\nconsider two models for a varying STIP rate: one in which STIP likelihood is\\ndetermined by stellar age alone, irrespective of galactic time, and another in\\nwhich the STIP likelihood suddenly increased in recent galactic history. Both\\nmodels, which impose a higher STIP likelihood among younger stars, produce a\\nnegative gradient in planet occurrence with increasing height from the galactic\\nmidplane. We find that a step function model in which STIP likelihood increased\\nby a factor of several ~a few Gyr ago resembles an observed trend among FGK\\ndwarfs.

These tasks span from extracting data and\\nsummarizing literature to generating content, predictive modeling,\\ndecision-making, and system controls. Moreover, Vision Large Models (VLMs) and\\nMultimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which represent the next generation of language\\nmodels, a.k.a., XLMs, can combine and integrate many data modalities with the\\nstrength of language understanding, thus advancing several information-based\\nsystems, such as Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). Indeed, by combining\\nlanguage communication with multimodal sensory inputs, e.g., panoramic images\\nand LiDAR or radar data, accurate driving actions can be taken. In this\\ncontext, we provide in this survey paper a comprehensive overview of the\\npotential of XLMs towards achieving autonomous driving. Specifically, we review\\nthe relevant literature on ADS and XLMs, including their architectures, tools,\\nand frameworks. Then, we detail the proposed approaches to deploy XLMs for\\nautonomous driving solutions. Finally, we provide the related challenges to XLM\\ndeployment for ADS and point to future research directions aiming to enable XLM\\nadoption in future ADS frameworks.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10484v1) |\\n| Efficient polarizable QM/MM using the direct reaction field Hamiltonian\\n  with electrostatic potential fitted multipole operators | Thomas P. Fay, Nicolas Ferr\\u00e9, Miquel Huix-Rotllant |   Electronic polarization and dispersion are decisive actors in determining\\ninteraction energies between molecules. These interactions have a particularly\\nprofound effect on excitation energies of molecules in complex environments,\\nespecially when the excitation involves a significant degree of charge\\nreorganisation. The direct reaction field (DRF) approach, which has seen a\\nrecent revival of interest, provides a powerful framework for describing these\\ninteractions in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models of\\nsystems, where a small subsystem of interest is described using quantum\\nchemical methods and the remainder is treated with a simple MM force field. In\\nthis paper we show how the DRF approach can be combined with the electrostatic\\npotential fitted (ESPF) multipole operator description of the QM region charge\\ndensity, which reduces the scaling $\\\\mathcal{O}(N_\\\\mathrm{MM}^3)$ of the method\\nwith MM system to $\\\\mathcal{O}(N_\\\\mathrm{MM}^2)$. We also show how the DRF\\napproach can be combined with fluctuating charge descriptions of the\\npolarizable environment, as well as previously used atom-centred\\ndipole-polarizability based models. We further show that the ESPF-DRF method\\nprovides an accurate description of molecular interactions in both ground and\\nexcited electronic states of the QM system and apply it to predict the gas to\\naqueous solution solvatochromic shifts in the UV/visible absorption spectrum of\\nacrolein.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10483v1) |\\n| Schrodinger's Memory: Large Language Models | Wei Wang, Qing Li |   Memory is the foundation of LLMs' functionality, yet past research has lacked\\nan in-depth exploration of their memory capabilities and underlying theory.

These assumptions limit their use\\nwhen acquisition conditions, such as the subject's distance from the camera or\\nthe camera's characteristics, are different than expected, as typically happens\\nin video surveillance. Additionally, 3DFR algorithms follow various strategies\\nto address the reconstruction of a 3D shape from 2D data, such as statistical\\nmodel fitting, photometric stereo, or deep learning. In the present study, we\\nexplore the application of three 3DFR algorithms representative of the SOTA,\\nemploying each one as the template set generator for a face verification\\nsystem.

We adopt the predict-then-optimize\\nframework for this analysis. Given that perfect model alignment with reality is\\noften unrealistic in practice, we focus on scenarios where the chosen\\nhypothesis set is misspecified. In this context, it remains unclear whether\\ncurrent contextual optimization approaches can effectively address such model\\nmisspecification. In this paper, we present a novel integrated learning and\\noptimization approach designed to tackle model misspecification in contextual\\noptimization. This approach offers theoretical generalizability, tractability,\\nand optimality guarantees, along with strong practical performance. Our method\\ninvolves minimizing a tractable surrogate loss that aligns with the performance\\nvalue from cost vector predictions, regardless of whether the model\\nmisspecified or not, and can be optimized in reasonable time. To our knowledge,\\nno previous work has provided an approach with such guarantees in the context\\nof model misspecification.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10479v1) |\\n| Local SGD for Near-Quadratic Problems: Improving Convergence under\\n  Unconstrained Noise Conditions | Andrey Sadchikov, Savelii Chezhegov, Aleksandr Beznosikov, Alexander Gasnikov |   Distributed optimization plays an important role in modern large-scale\\nmachine learning and data processing systems by optimizing the utilization of\\ncomputational resources. One of the classical and popular approaches is Local\\nStochastic Gradient Descent (Local SGD), characterized by multiple local\\nupdates before averaging, which is particularly useful in distributed\\nenvironments to reduce communication bottlenecks and improve scalability. A\\ntypical feature of this method is the dependence on the frequency of\\ncommunications. But in the case of a quadratic target function with homogeneous\\ndata distribution over all devices, the influence of frequency of\\ncommunications vanishes. As a natural consequence, subsequent studies include\\nthe assumption of a Lipschitz Hessian, as this indicates the similarity of the\\noptimized function to a quadratic one to some extent. However, in order to\\nextend the completeness of the Local SGD theory and unlock its potential, in\\nthis paper we abandon the Lipschitz Hessian assumption by introducing a new\\nconcept of $\\\\textit{approximate quadraticity}$. This assumption gives a new\\nperspective on problems that have near quadratic properties. In addition,\\nexisting theoretical analyses of Local SGD often assume bounded variance. We,\\nin turn, consider the unbounded noise condition, which allows us to broaden the\\nclass of studied problems.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10478v1) |\\n| SimInversion: A Simple Framework for Inversion-Based Text-to-Image\\n  Editing | Qi Qian, Haiyang Xu, Ming Yan, Juhua Hu |   Diffusion models demonstrate impressive image generation performance with\\ntext guidance. Inspired by the learning process of diffusion, existing images\\ncan be edited according to text by DDIM inversion. However, the vanilla DDIM\\ninversion is not optimized for classifier-free guidance and the accumulated\\nerror will result in the undesired performance. While many algorithms are\\ndeveloped to improve the framework of DDIM inversion for editing, in this work,\\nwe investigate the approximation error in DDIM inversion and propose to\\ndisentangle the guidance scale for the source and target branches to reduce the\\nerror while keeping the original framework. Moreover, a better guidance scale\\n(i.e., 0.5) than default settings can be derived theoretically. Experiments on\\nPIE-Bench show that our proposal can improve the performance of DDIM inversion\\ndramatically without sacrificing efficiency.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10476v1) |\\n| Leadership and Engagement Dynamics in Legislative Twitter Networks:\\n  Statistical Analysis and Modeling | Carolina Luque, Juan Sosa |   In this manuscript, we analyze the interaction network on Twitter among\\nmembers of the 117th U.S. Congress to assess the visibility of political\\nleaders and explore how systemic properties and node attributes influence the\\nformation of legislative connections. We employ descriptive social network\\nstatistical methods, the exponential random graph model (ERGM), and the\\nstochastic block model (SBM) to evaluate the relative impact of network\\nsystemic properties, as well as institutional and personal traits, on the\\ngeneration of online relationships among legislators. Our findings reveal that\\nlegislative networks on social media platforms like Twitter tend to reinforce\\nthe leadership of dominant political actors rather than diminishing their\\ninfluence.

However, previous works either rely on contrastive learning that\\nsuffers false negative problems or are based on reconstruction that learns too\\nmuch unessential low-level clues, leading to limited representations for\\ndownstream tasks. Recently, great advances have been made in generative\\nlearning, which is naturally a challenging yet meaningful pretext task to model\\nthe general underlying data distributions. However, the representation learning\\ncapacity of generative models is under-explored, especially for the skeletons\\nwith spacial sparsity and temporal redundancy. To this end, we propose Masked\\nConditional Diffusion (MacDiff) as a unified framework for human skeleton\\nmodeling. For the first time, we leverage diffusion models as effective\\nskeleton representation learners. Specifically, we train a diffusion decoder\\nconditioned on the representations extracted by a semantic encoder. Random\\nmasking is applied to encoder inputs to introduce a information bottleneck and\\nremove redundancy of skeletons. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that\\nour generative objective involves the contrastive learning objective which\\naligns the masked and noisy views. Meanwhile, it also enforces the\\nrepresentation to complement for the noisy view, leading to better\\ngeneralization performance. MacDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on\\nrepresentation learning benchmarks while maintaining the competence for\\ngenerative tasks. Moreover, we leverage the diffusion model for data\\naugmentation, significantly enhancing the fine-tuning performance in scenarios\\nwith scarce labeled data.

Hassan |   The proliferation of open Pre-trained Language Models (PTLMs) on model\\nregistry platforms like Hugging Face (HF) presents both opportunities and\\nchallenges for companies building products around them. Similar to traditional\\nsoftware dependencies, PTLMs continue to evolve after a release. However, the\\ncurrent state of release practices of PTLMs on model registry platforms are\\nplagued by a variety of inconsistencies, such as ambiguous naming conventions\\nand inaccessible model training documentation. Given the knowledge gap on\\ncurrent PTLM release practices, our empirical study uses a mixed-methods\\napproach to analyze the releases of 52,227 PTLMs on the most well-known model\\nregistry, HF. Our results reveal 148 different naming practices for PTLM\\nreleases, with 40.87% of changes to model weight files not represented in the\\nadopted name-based versioning practice or their documentation. In addition, we\\nidentified that the 52,227 PTLMs are derived from only 299 different base\\nmodels (the modified original models used to create 52,227 PTLMs), with\\nFine-tuning and Quantization being the most prevalent modification methods\\napplied to these base models. Significant gaps in release transparency, in\\nterms of training dataset specifications and model card availability, still\\nexist, highlighting the need for standardized documentation. While we\\nidentified a model naming practice explicitly differentiating between major and\\nminor PTLM releases, we did not find any significant difference in the types of\\nchanges that went into either type of releases, suggesting that major/minor\\nversion numbers for PTLMs often are chosen arbitrarily. Our findings provide\\nvaluable insights to improve PTLM release practices, nudging the field towards\\nmore formal semantic versioning practices.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10472v1) |\\n| Real-Time Whole-Body Control of Legged Robots with Model-Predictive Path\\n  Integral Control | Juan Alvarez-Padilla, John Z.

F. Lizarraga, Flavia M. D. Marquitti, Marcus A. M. de Aguiar |   We investigate the role of assortative mating in speciation using the\\nsympatric model of Derrida and Higgs. The model explores the idea that genetic\\ndifferences create incompatibilities between individuals, preventing mating if\\nthe number of such differences is too large. Speciation, however, only happens\\nin this mating system if the number of genes is large. Here we show that\\nspeciation with small genome sizes can occur if assortative mating is\\nintroduced. In our model individuals are represented by three chromosomes: one\\nresponsible for reproductive compatibility, one for coding the trait on which\\nassortativity will operate, and a neutral chromosome. Reproduction is possible\\nif individuals are genetically similar with respect to the first chromosome,\\nbut among these compatible mating partners, the one with the most similar trait\\ncoded by the second chromosome is selected. We show that this type of\\nassortativity facilitates speciation, which can happen with a small number of\\ngenes in the first chromosome. Species, classified according to reproductive\\nisolation, dictated by the first chromosome, can display different traits\\nvalues, as measured by the second and the third chromosomes. Therefore, species\\ncan also be identified based on similarity of the neutral trait, which works as\\na proxy for reproductive isolation.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10466v1) |\\n| A stabilized total pressure-formulation of the Biot's poroelasticity\\n  equations in frequency domain: numerical analysis and applications | Cristian C\\u00e1rcamo, Alfonso Caiazzo, Felipe Galarce, Joaqu\\u00edn Mura |   This work focuses on the numerical solution of the dynamics of a poroelastic\\nmaterial in the frequency domain.

In\\nthis work we give multiple results related to the property testing of direct\\nsums.\\n  Our first result concerns a test proposed by Dinur and Golubev in 2019.

As an application of our result, we obtain a direct sum test which works\\nin the online adversary model of \\\\cite{KRV}.\\n  Finally, we also discuss a Fourier analytic interpretation of the diamond\\ntester in the $n=2$ case, as well as prove local correction results for direct\\nsum as conjectured by Dinur and Golubev.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10464v1) |\\n| Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks in Low-Data Regimes: A Comparative Study with\\n  Multilayer Perceptrons | Farhad Pourkamali-Anaraki |   Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) have long been a cornerstone in deep learning,\\nknown for their capacity to model complex relationships. Recently,\\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a compelling alternative,\\nutilizing highly flexible learnable activation functions directly on network\\nedges, a departure from the neuron-centric approach of MLPs. However, KANs\\nsignificantly increase the number of learnable parameters, raising concerns\\nabout their effectiveness in data-scarce environments. This paper presents a\\ncomprehensive comparative study of MLPs and KANs from both algorithmic and\\nexperimental perspectives, with a focus on low-data regimes. We introduce an\\neffective technique for designing MLPs with unique, parameterized activation\\nfunctions for each neuron, enabling a more balanced comparison with KANs. Using\\nempirical evaluations on simulated data and two real-world data sets from\\nmedicine and engineering, we explore the trade-offs between model complexity\\nand accuracy, with particular attention to the role of network depth. Our\\nfindings show that MLPs with individualized activation functions achieve\\nsignificantly higher predictive accuracy with only a modest increase in\\nparameters, especially when the sample size is limited to around one hundred.\\nFor example, in a three-class classification problem within additive\\nmanufacturing, MLPs achieve a median accuracy of 0.91, significantly\\noutperforming KANs, which only reach a median accuracy of 0.53 with default\\nhyperparameters.

To focus on the role of the different locations of the\\nexcitatory synapses, we use two identical neurons where the set of input\\nsignals is grouped at two different distances from the soma. The system is\\nintended to represent a CA1 hippocampal neuron in which the synapses arriving\\nfrom the CA3 neurons of the trisynaptic pathway appear to be localised in the\\napical dendritic region and are, in principle, either proximal or distal to the\\nsoma. Synchronisation is studied using a specifically defined spiking\\ncorrelation function as a function of various parameters such as the distance\\nfrom the soma of one of the synaptic groups, the inhibition weight and the\\nassociated activation delay. We found that the neurons' spiking activity\\ndepends nonmonotonically on the relative dendritic location of the synapses and\\ntheir inhibitory weight, whereas the synchronisation measure always decreases\\nwith inhibition, and strongly depends on its activation time delay. The\\nbackground activity on the somas results essentially independent on the\\nfluctuation intensity and strongly support the importance of the balance\\nbetween inhibition and excitation for neuronal synchronization.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10460v1) |\\n| Efficiently Crowdsourcing Visual Importance with Punch-Hole Annotation | Minsuk Chang, Soohyun Lee, Aeri Cho, Hyeon Jeon, Seokhyeon Park, Cindy Xiong Bearfield, Jinwook Seo |   We introduce a novel crowdsourcing method for identifying important areas in\\ngraphical images through punch-hole labeling. Traditional methods, such as gaze\\ntrackers and mouse-based annotations, which generate continuous data, can be\\nimpractical in crowdsourcing scenarios. They require many participants, and the\\noutcome data can be noisy. In contrast, our method first segments the graphical\\nimage with a grid and drops a portion of the patches (punch holes). Then, we\\niteratively ask the labeler to validate each annotation with holes, narrowing\\ndown the annotation only having the most important area. This approach aims to\\nreduce annotation noise in crowdsourcing by standardizing the annotations while\\nenhancing labeling efficiency and reliability. Preliminary findings from\\nfundamental charts demonstrate that punch-hole labeling can effectively\\npinpoint critical regions. This also highlights its potential for broader\\napplication in visualization research, particularly in studying large-scale\\nusers' graphical perception.

Chodas |   This work is dedicated to debias the Near-Earth Objects (NEO) population\\nbased on observations from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System\\n(ATLAS) telescopes. We have applied similar methods used to develop the\\nrecently released NEO model generator (NEOMOD), once debiasing the NEO\\npopulation using data from Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) G96 telescope. ATLAS is\\ncomposed of four different telescopes. We first analyzed observational data\\nfrom each of all four telescopes separately and later combined them. Our\\nresults highlight main differences between CSS and ATLAS, e.g., sky coverage\\nand survey power at debiasing the NEO population. ATLAS has a much larger sky\\ncoverage than CSS, allowing it to find bright NEOs that would be constantly\\n\\\"hiding\\\" from CSS. Consequently, ATLAS is more powerful than CSS at debiasing\\nthe NEO population for H $\\\\lesssim$ 19. With its intrinsically greater\\nsensitivity and emphasis on observing near opposition, CSS excels in the\\ndebiasing of smaller objects. ATLAS, as an all sky survey designed to find\\nimminent hazardous objects, necessarily spends a significant fraction of time\\nlooking at places on the sky where objects do not appear, reducing its power\\nfor debiasing the population of small objects. We estimate a NEO population\\ncompleteness of $\\\\approx$ 88%$^{+3\\\\%}_{-2\\\\%}$ for H $<$ 17.75 and $\\\\approx$\\n36%$^{+1\\\\%}_{-1\\\\%}$ for H $<$ 22.25.

Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited\\nfocus on developing and evaluating explainable neural-based graph generative\\nmodels specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we\\npropose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE\\nextracts node-level representations that express node memberships over distinct\\nextreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is\\nachieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its\\npolarization.

Aguilar, Ralph Bohlin, Misty Cracraft, Marjorie Decleir, Andras Gaspar, David R. Law, Alberto Noriega-Crespo, Michael Regan |   The absolute flux calibration of the Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and\\nCoronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first\\n2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the\\nflux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays,\\nand different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining\\nobserved aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions\\nbased on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of\\nthese observations were combined with model point-spread-functions to measure\\nthe corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with\\ntime, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time,\\nrate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations\\nwere with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately\\nevery month revealed a modest time-dependent response loss seen mainly at the\\nlongest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential\\nwith a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the\\nband-dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was\\nfound to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different\\nsubarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame.

Yip |   Camera-to-robot calibration is crucial for vision-based robot control and\\nrequires effort to make it accurate. Recent advancements in markerless pose\\nestimation methods have eliminated the need for time-consuming physical setups\\nfor camera-to-robot calibration. While the existing markerless pose estimation\\nmethods have demonstrated impressive accuracy without the need for cumbersome\\nsetups, they rely on the assumption that all the robot joints are visible\\nwithin the camera's field of view. However, in practice, robots usually move in\\nand out of view, and some portion of the robot may stay out-of-frame during the\\nwhole manipulation task due to real-world constraints, leading to a lack of\\nsufficient visual features and subsequent failure of these approaches. To\\naddress this challenge and enhance the applicability to vision-based robot\\ncontrol, we propose a novel framework capable of estimating the robot pose with\\npartially visible robot manipulators. Our approach leverages the\\nVision-Language Models for fine-grained robot components detection, and\\nintegrates it into a keypoint-based pose estimation network, which enables more\\nrobust performance in varied operational conditions. The framework is evaluated\\non both public robot datasets and self-collected partial-view datasets to\\ndemonstrate our robustness and generalizability. As a result, this method is\\neffective for robot pose estimation in a wider range of real-world manipulation\\nscenarios.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10441v1) |\\n| Successive topological phase transitions in two distinct spin-flop\\n  phases on the honeycomb lattice | Xudong Li, Jize Zhao, Jinbin Li, Qiang Luo |   The Kitaev magnets with bond-dependent interactions have garnered\\nconsiderable attention in recent years for their ability to harbor exotic\\nphases and nontrivial excitations. The topological magnons, which are indicated\\nby nonzero Chern number and thermal Hall conductivity, are proposed to\\npartially explain thermal Hall measurements in real materials. Hitherto,\\ntopological magnons have been extensively explored when the magnetic field is\\nnormal to the honeycomb plane, but their topological characteristics are less\\nstudied in the presence of in-plane magnetic field. Here, we study two distinct\\nin-plane field induced spin-flop phases in the $\\\\Gamma$-$\\\\Gamma'$ model, both\\nof which are off-diagonal couplings that have intimate relation to the Kitaev\\ninteraction. The two spin-flop phases are distinguished by their out-of-plane\\nspin components which can be either antiparallel or parallel, thus dubbing\\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) spin-flop phases, respectively.\\nWe map out topological phase diagrams for both phases, revealing a rich pattern\\nof the Chern number over exchange parameters and magnetic field. We\\nanalytically calculate the boundaries of topological phase transitions when the\\nmagnetic field is along the $a$ and $b$ directions. We find that the thermal\\nHall conductivity and its derivative display contrasting behaviors when\\ncrossing different topological phase transitions. The striking difference of\\nthe two phases lies in that when the magnetic field is along the $b$ direction,\\ntopological magnons are totally absent in the AFM spin-flop phase, while they\\ncan survive in the FM analogue in certain parameter regions.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10439v1) |\\n| A functorial approach to $n$-abelian categories | Vitor Gulisz |   We develop a functorial approach to the study of $n$-abelian categories by\\nreformulating their axioms in terms of their categories of finitely presented\\nfunctors.

The vast majority of\\nenergy-preserving reduced-order methods use symplectic Galerkin projection to\\nconstruct reduced-order Hamiltonian models by projecting the full models onto a\\nsymplectic subspace.

In this context, the proposed method is non-intrusive. The proposed\\nmethod is grey box in the sense that it requires only some basic knowledge of\\nthe multi-symplectic model at the partial differential equation level. We prove\\nthat the proposed method satisfies spatially discrete local energy conservation\\nand preserves the multi-symplectic conservation laws.

Papoutsis, I. E. Papadakis, C. Panagiotou, M. Dov\\u010diak, E. Kammoun |   Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to be variable across all\\nwavelengths. Significant observational efforts have been invested in the last\\ndecade in studying their ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability. Long and\\ndensely sampled, multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns of numerous Seyfert\\ngalaxies have been conducted with the aim of determining the X-ray/UV/optical\\ncontinuum time lags. Time-lag studies can be used to constrain theoretical\\nmodels. The observed time lags can be explained by thermal reprocessing of the\\nX-rays illuminating the accretion disc (known as the X-ray reverberation\\nmodel). However, the observed light curves contain more information that can be\\nused to further constrain physical models. Our primary objective is to\\ninvestigate whether, in addition to time lags, the X-ray reverberation model\\ncan also explain the UV/optical variability amplitude of nearby Seyferts. To do\\nthis, we measured the excess variance of four sources (namely Mrk 509, NGC\\n4151, NGC 2617, and Mrk 142) as a function of wavelength using data from\\narchival long, multi-wavelength campaigns with Swift, and ground-based\\ntelescopes.

We tested the validity of the\\nmodel by comparing the measured and model variances for a range of accretion\\nrates and X-ray source heights. We conclude that the X-ray thermal\\nreverberation model can fit both the continuum, UV/optical time lags, as well\\nas the variance in these AGNs, for the same physical parameters. Our results\\nsuggest that the accretion disc is constant and that all the observed\\nUV/optical variations, on timescales of days and up to a few weeks, can be\\nfully explained by the variable X-rays as they illuminate the accretion disc.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10417v1) |\\n| Local central limit theorem for Mallows measure | Alexey Bufetov, Kailun Chen |   We study the statistics of the Mallows measure on permutations in the limit\\npioneered by Starr (2009).

It covers 158\\nwidely-used SDKs from two key SDK release platforms, the official one and a\\nlarge alternative one. From them, we identified 338 instances of privacy data\\nexfiltration. On the privacy compliance, our study reveals that more than 30%\\nof the examined SDKs fail to provide a privacy policy to disclose their data\\nhandling practices. Among those that provide privacy policies, 37% of them\\nover-collect user data, and 88% falsely claim access to sensitive data. We\\nrevisit the latest versions of the SDKs after 12 months. Our analysis\\ndemonstrates a persistent lack of improvement in these concerning trends. Based\\non our findings, we propose three actionable recommendations to mitigate the\\nprivacy leakage risks and enhance privacy protection for Android users.

As raw traces obscure the true temporal structure of neuron's\\nactivity, we performed a tuned filtering of the calcium concentration using two\\nmethods: a biophysical model and a kernel mapping. The former characterizes\\nspike trains related to a particular triggering event, while the latter filters\\nout the signal and refines the selection of the underlying neuronal response.\\nTransitioning from traditional time series analysis to point process theory,\\nthe study explores spike-time distance metrics and point pattern prototypes to\\ndescribe repeated observations. We assume that the analyzed neuron's firing\\nevents, i.e. spike occurrences, are temporal point process events. In\\nparticular, the study aims to categorize 47 point patterns by depth, assuming\\nthe similarity of spike occurrences within specific depth categories. The\\nresults highlight the pivotal roles of depth and stimuli in discerning diverse\\ntemporal structures of neuron firing events, confirming the point process\\napproach based on prototype analysis is largely useful in the classification of\\nspike traces.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10409v1) |\\n| Variational closures for composite homogenised fluid flows | Theo Diamantakis, Ruiao Hu |   The Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport is a variational formulation of\\nstochastic fluid dynamics introduced to model the effects of unresolved scales,\\nwhilst preserving the geometric structure of ideal fluid flows. In this work,\\nwe show that the SALT equations can arise from the decomposition of the fluid\\nflow map into its mean and fluctuating components.

The\\ndynamics of the mean component are derived from a variational principle\\nutilising particular forms of variations that preserve the composite structure\\nof the flow. Using a new variational principle, we show that SALT equations can\\narise from random Lagrangians and are equivalent to random coefficient PDEs.

Drawing parallels from the successful application\\nof Gibrat's law of proportional growth in explaining city size and word\\nfrequency distributions, we tested whether the same principle could account for\\nthe log-normal distribution in Bitcoin balances. However, our calculations\\nrevealed that the exponent parameters in both the drift and variance terms\\ndeviate slightly from one. This suggests that Gibrat's proportional growth rule\\nalone does not fully explain the log-normal distribution observed in Bitcoin\\nusers' balances. During our exploration, we discovered an intriguing\\nphenomenon: Bitcoin users tend to fall into two distinct categories based on\\ntheir behavior, which we refer to as ``poor\\\" and ``wealthy\\\" users. Poor users,\\nwho initially purchase only a small amount of Bitcoin, tend to buy more\\nbitcoins first and then sell out all their holdings gradually over time. The\\ncertainty of selling all their coins is higher and higher with time. In\\ncontrast, wealthy users, who acquire a large amount of Bitcoin from the start,\\ntend to sell off their holdings over time. The speed at which they sell their\\nbitcoins is lower and lower over time and they will hold at least a small part\\nof their initial holdings at last. Interestingly, the wealthier the user, the\\nlarger the proportion of their balance and the higher the certainty they tend\\nto sell.

In meiosis II mouse oocytes (developing egg cells) awaiting\\nfertilisation, the spindle, which is the protein structure responsible for\\ndividing genetic material in a cell, must maintain its position near the cell\\ncortex (the thin actin network bound to the cell membrane) for many hours.\\nHowever, the cytoplasmic streaming that accompanies this stable positioning\\nwould intuitively appear to destabilise the spindle position. Here, through a\\ncombination of numerical and analytical modelling, we reveal a new,\\nhydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning beneath the cortical cap.\\nWe show that this stability depends critically on the spindle size and the\\nactive driving from the cortex, and demonstrate that stable spindle positioning\\ncan result purely from a hydrodynamic suction force exerted on the spindle by\\nthe cytoplasmic flow. Our findings show that local fluid dynamic forces can be\\nsufficient to stabilise the spindle, explaining robustness against\\nperturbations not only perpendicular but also parallel to the cortex.

Since it offers a well-motivated starting point for\\nthe study of physics at very high energies, we incorporate an $R^2$ term in the\\nPalatini gravity. In addition, afterward the inflation, the inflaton oscillates\\nabout the minimum of the inflation potential, and reheats the universe. This\\noccurs during the reheating phase, at which the inflaton decays into the\\nstandard model particles, which fill the universe. We extend our examination by\\nconsidering the reheating effects on inflationary observables by employing the\\ndifferent scenarios of the reheat temperature.

The majority of work that has been\\ndone is focused on Deep Learning (DL) based approaches. However, with the\\nemergence of new algorithms such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm, there\\nis growing interest in exploring alternative approaches that may offer unique\\nadvantages in certain domains or applications. One of these domains is\\nFederated Learning (FL), in which users privacy is of utmost importance.

In this work, we propose a novel approach dubbed TPFL:\\nTsetlin-Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into\\nclusters based on their confidence towards a specific class. In this way,\\nclustering can benefit from two key advantages. Firstly, clients share only\\nwhat they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight\\naggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been\\nenough during the training. This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are\\nnon-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID). Secondly, by sharing\\nonly weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially\\nreduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication\\ncost.

However,\\nsuch fixed feature encoders tend to be class-agnostic, inevitably activating\\nobjects that are irrelevant to the target class. In contrast, humans can\\neffortlessly focus on specific objects in the line of sight. This paper mimics\\nthe visual perception pattern of human beings and proposes a novel and powerful\\nprompt-driven scheme, called ``Prompt and Transfer\\\" (PAT), which constructs a\\ndynamic class-aware prompting paradigm to tune the encoder for focusing on the\\ninterested object (target class) in the current task. Three key points are\\nelaborated to enhance the prompting: 1) Cross-modal linguistic information is\\nintroduced to initialize prompts for each task. 2) Semantic Prompt Transfer\\n(SPT) that precisely transfers the class-specific semantics within the images\\nto prompts. 3) Part Mask Generator (PMG) that works in conjunction with SPT to\\nadaptively generate different but complementary part prompts for different\\nindividuals.

However, this introduces\\nthe complexities of numerical derivatives into the training process of these\\nmodels. In this study, we propose modifying the structure of the traditional\\nRNN to enable the prediction of each block over a time interval, making it\\npossible to calculate the derivative of the output with respect to time using\\nthe backpropagation algorithm.

Most of the state-of-the-art architectures\\nuse transformers or diffusion-based models to perform this task, despite the\\nheavy computational burden that they require.

To overcome the above, this paper\\nexplores a novel design of Mamba, an emergent State-Space Model (SSM), called\\nMamba-ST, to perform style transfer. To do so, we adapt Mamba linear equation\\nto simulate the behavior of cross-attention layers, which are able to combine\\ntwo separate embeddings into a single output, but drastically reducing memory\\nusage and time complexity.

Utilizing a combination of tight-binding theory and density functional\\ntheory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on\\nelectronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the\\nelectronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function,\\nwhich significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the\\noverall {\\\\it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT\\ncalculations reveal that $AB$-stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal\\nconductivity compared to $AA$-stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic\\nscattering and phonon group velocity.

The perspective involves testing whether one node, which may represent\\na brain region, can control the dynamics of the other. The node that has such\\nan impact on the other is called a threshold variable and can be classified as\\na causative because its functionality is the leading source operating as an\\ninstantaneous switching mechanism that regulates the time-varying\\nautoregressive structure of the other. This statistical concept is commonly\\nreferred to as threshold non-linearity. Once threshold non-linearity has been\\nverified between a pair of nodes, the subsequent essential facet of TAR\\nmodeling is to assess the predictive ability of the causal node for the current\\nactivity on the other and represent causal interactions in autoregressive\\nterms. This predictive ability is what underlies Granger causality. The TAR4C\\napproach can discover non-linear and time-dependent causal interactions without\\nnegating the G-causality perspective. The efficacy of the proposed approach is\\nexemplified by analyzing the EEG signals recorded during the motor\\nmovement/imagery experiment. The similarities and differences between the\\ncausal interactions manifesting during the execution and the imagery of a given\\nmotor movement are demonstrated by analyzing EEG recordings from multiple\\nsubjects.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10374v1) |\\n| Instigating Cooperation among LLM Agents Using Adaptive Information\\n  Modulation | Qiliang Chen,  Alireza,  Ilami, Nunzio Lore, Babak Heydari |   This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for\\nhuman strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these\\nagents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments.

Their widespread\\nindustrial use and resistance to degradation have led to global environmental\\ncontamination and significant health concerns. While a minority of PFAS have\\nbeen extensively studied, the toxicity of many PFAS remains poorly understood\\ndue to limited direct toxicological data. This study advances the predictive\\nmodeling of PFAS toxicity by combining semi-supervised graph convolutional\\nnetworks (GCNs) with molecular descriptors and fingerprints. We propose a novel\\napproach to enhance the prediction of PFAS binding affinities by isolating\\nmolecular fingerprints to construct graphs where then descriptors are set as\\nthe node features. This approach specifically captures the structural,\\nphysicochemical, and topological features of PFAS without overfitting due to an\\nabundance of features. Unsupervised clustering then identifies representative\\ncompounds for detailed binding studies. Our results provide a more accurate\\nability to estimate PFAS hepatotoxicity to provide guidance in chemical\\ndiscovery of new PFAS and the development of new safety regulations.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10370v1) |\\n| Stochastic Control of UAVs: An Optimal Tradeoff between Performance,\\n  Flight Smoothness and Control Effort | George Rapakoulias, Panagiotis Tsiotras |   Safe and accurate control of unmanned aerial vehicles in the presence of\\nwinds is a challenging control problem due to the hard-to-model and highly\\nstochastic nature of the disturbance forces acting upon the vehicle. To meet\\nperformance constraints, state-of-the-art control methods such as Incremental\\nNonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) or other adaptive control techniques require\\nhigh control gains to mitigate the effects of uncertainty entering the system.\\nWhile achieving good tracking performance, IDNI requires excessive control\\neffort, results in high actuator strain, and reduced flight smoothness due to\\nconstant and aggressive corrective actions commanded by the controller. In this\\npaper, we propose a novel control architecture that allows the user to\\nsystematically address the trade-off between high authority control and\\nperformance constraint satisfaction. Our approach consists of two parts. To\\ncancel out biases introduced by unmodelled aerodynamic effects we propose a\\nhybrid, model-based disturbance force estimator augmented with a neural\\nnetwork, that can adapt to external wind conditions using a Kalman Filter. We\\nthen utilize state-of-the-art results from Covariance Steering theory, which\\noffers a principled way of controlling the uncertainty of the tracking error\\ndynamics.

Conventional models\\npredominantly relying on radar data have limited performance in predicting\\ncases with complex temporal features such as convection initiation,\\nhighlighting the need to integrate data from other sources for more\\ncomprehensive nowcasting. Unlike physics-based models, machine learning\\n(ML)-based models offer promising solutions for efficiently integrating large\\nvolumes of diverse data. We present EF4INCA, a spatiotemporal Transformer model\\nfor precipitation nowcasting that integrates satellite- and ground-based\\nobservations with numerical weather prediction outputs. EF4INCA provides\\nhigh-resolution forecasts over Austria, accurately predicting the location and\\nshape of precipitation fields with a spatial resolution of 1 kilometre and a\\ntemporal resolution of 5 minutes, up to 90 minutes ahead. Our evaluation shows\\nthat EF4INCA outperforms conventional nowcasting models, including the\\noperational model of Austria, particularly in scenarios with complex temporal\\nfeatures such as convective initiation and rapid weather changes. EF4INCA\\nmaintains higher accuracy in location forecasting but generates smoother fields\\nat later prediction times compared to traditional models. Interpretation of our\\nmodel showed that precipitation products and SEVIRI infrared channels CH7 and\\nCH9 are the most important data streams. These results underscore the\\nimportance of combining data from different domains, including physics-based\\nmodel products, with ML approaches. Our study highlights the robustness of\\nEF4INCA and its potential for improved precipitation nowcasting.

We find the dEs exhibit a\ndiversity in ages with the younger dEs being less enhanced than the older,\nsuggesting a complex star formation history for those dEs that recently entered\nVirgo while others have been quenched shortly after reionization.\nOrbit-superposition modeling allowed us to recover viewing angles, stellar\nmass-to-light ratios (with gradients), as well as the intrinsic orbit\nstructure. We find that the angular momentum of the dEs is strongly suppressed\ncompared to ordinary early-type galaxies and correlates with the environment.\nFlattened dEs are so because of a suppressed kinetic energy perpendicular to\ntheir equatorial plane. Combining population and dynamical modeling results, we\nfind an age-dependent stellar initial mass function (IMF) or, alternatively,\nevidence for a more extended star formation history for those galaxies that\nhave had higher initial mass and/or inhabited lower density environments. dEs\nappear to have a spatially homogeneous stellar structure but the state they\nwere `frozen' in as they stopped forming stars varies dramatically according to\ntheir initial conditions.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10518v1) |\n| RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Vector\n  Retrieval | Di Liu, Meng Chen, Baotong Lu, Huiqiang Jiang, Zhenhua Han, Qianxi Zhang, Qi Chen, Chengruidong Zhang, Bailu Ding, Kai Zhang, Chen Chen, Fan Yang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu |   Transformer-based large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly important\nin various domains. However, the quadratic time complexity of attention\noperation poses a significant challenge for scaling to longer contexts due to\nthe extremely high inference latency and GPU memory consumption for caching\nkey-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free\napproach to accelerate attention computation. To leverage the dynamic sparse\nproperty of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor\nsearch (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most\nrelevant ones via vector search during generation. Due to the\nout-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors, off-the-shelf\nANNS indexes still need to scan O(N) (usually 30% of all keys) data for\naccurate retrieval, which fails to exploit the high sparsity.\nRetrievalAttention first identifies the OOD challenge of ANNS-based attention,\nand addresses it via an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt\nto queries and only access 1--3% of data, thus achieving a sub-linear time\ncomplexity. RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of\nlong-context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the\nmodel accuracy. Especially, RetrievalAttention only needs 16GB GPU memory for\nserving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating\none token in 0.188 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB).\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516v1) |\n| An Efficient Self-Learning Framework For Interactive Spoken Dialog\n  Systems | Hitesh Tulsiani, David M. Chan, Shalini Ghosh, Garima Lalwani, Prabhat Pandey, Ankish Bansal, Sri Garimella, Ariya Rastrow, Bj\u00f6rn Hoffmeister |   Dialog systems, such as voice assistants, are expected to engage with users\nin complex, evolving conversations. Unfortunately, traditional automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) systems deployed in such applications are usually trained to\nrecognize each turn independently and lack the ability to adapt to the\nconversational context or incorporate user feedback. In this work, we introduce\na general framework for ASR in dialog systems that can go beyond learning from\nsingle-turn utterances and learn over time how to adapt to both explicit\nsupervision and implicit user feedback present in multi-turn conversations. We\naccomplish that by leveraging advances in student-teacher learning and\ncontext-aware dialog processing, and designing contrastive self-supervision\napproaches with Ohm, a new online hard-negative mining approach. We show that\nleveraging our new framework compared to traditional training leads to relative\nWER reductions of close to 10% in real-world dialog systems, and up to 26% on\npublic synthetic data.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10515v1) |\n| Constraints on axions from patchy screening of the cosmic microwave\n  background | Samuel Goldstein, Fiona McCarthy, Cristina Mondino, J.

Originally, weak superimposed codes\nwere introduced in the context of multimedia content protection against illegal\ndistribution of copies under the assumption that a coalition of malicious users\nmay employ the averaging attack with adversarial noise.

In this paper,\nwe introduce Pennsieve - an open-source, cloud-based scientific data management\nplatform built to meet these needs. Pennsieve supports complex multimodal\ndatasets and provides tools for data visualization and analyses. It takes a\ncomprehensive approach to data integration, enabling researchers to define\ncustom metadata schemas and utilize advanced tools to filter and query their\ndata. Pennsieve's modular architecture allows external applications to extend\nits capabilities, and collaborative workspaces with peer-reviewed data\npublishing mechanisms promote high-quality datasets optimized for downstream\nanalysis, both in the cloud and on-premises.\n  Pennsieve forms the core for major neuroscience research programs including\nthe NIH SPARC Initiative, NIH HEAL Initiative's PRECISION Human Pain Network,\nand NIH HEAL RE-JOIN Initiative.

Specifically, we investigate the role of resistivity\nin the dynamical evolution of neutron stars over a period of up to 100 ms and\nits effects on their quasi-equilibrium configurations. Our results demonstrate\nthat resistivity can significantly influence the development of\nmagnetohydrodynamic instabilities, resulting in markedly different magnetic\nfield geometries. Additionally, resistivity suppresses the growth of these\ninstabilities, leading to a reduction in the amplitude of emitted gravitational\nwaves. Despite the variations in magnetic field geometries, the ratio of\npoloidal to toroidal field energies remains consistently 9:1 throughout the\nsimulations, for the models we investigated.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10508v1) |\n| Beth-Uhlenbeck equation for the thermodynamics of fluctuations in a\n  generalised 2+1D Gross-Neveu model | Biplab Mahato, David Blaschke, Dietmar Ebert |   We study a generalised version of Gross-Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions. The\nmodel is inspired from graphene which shows a linear dispersion relation near\nthe Dirac points. The phase structure and the thermodynamic properties in the\nmean field approximation have been studied before. Here we go beyond the mean\nfield level by deriving a Beth-Uhlenbeck equation for Gaussian fluctuations,\nsolutions of which we explore numerically, for the first time including their\nmomentum dependence.

We propose an LLM-based translation\nscheme that improves the success rate of translating large-scale C code into\ncompilable Rust code. Our approach involves three key techniques: (1)\npre-processing the C code to better align its structure and expressions with\nRust, (2) segmenting the code into optimally sized translation units to avoid\nexceeding the LLM's context window limits, and (3) iteratively compiling and\nrepairing errors while maintaining consistency between translation units using\ncontext-supplementing prompts. Compilation success is an essential first step\nin achieving functional equivalence, as only compilable code can be further\ntested. In experiments with 20 benchmark C programs, including those exceeding\n4 kilo lines of code, we successfully translated all programs into compilable\nRust code without losing corresponding parts of the original code.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10506v1) |\n| Machine Learning Optimization of non-Kasha Behavior and of Transient\n  Dynamics in Model Retinal Isomerization | Davinder Singh, Chern Chuang, Paul Brumer |   Designing a model of retinal isomerization in Rhodopsin, the first step in\nvision, that accounts for both experimental transient and stationary state\nobservables is challenging. Here, multi-objective Bayesian optimization is\nemployed to refine the parameters of a minimal two-state-two-mode (TM) model\ndescribing the photoisomerization of retinal in Rhodopsin. With an appropriate\nselection of objectives, the optimized retinal model predicts excitation\nwavelength-dependent fluorescence spectra that closely align with\nexperimentally observed non-Kasha behavior in the non-equilibrium steady state.\nFurther, adjustments to the potential energy surface within the TM model reduce\nthe discrepancies across the time domain. Overall, agreement with experimental\ndata is excellent.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10505v1) |\n| DILA: Dictionary Label Attention for Mechanistic Interpretability in\n  High-dimensional Multi-label Medical Coding Prediction | John Wu, David Wu, Jimeng Sun |   Predicting high-dimensional or extreme multilabels, such as in medical\ncoding, requires both accuracy and interpretability. Existing works often rely\non local interpretability methods, failing to provide comprehensive\nexplanations of the overall mechanism behind each label prediction within a\nmultilabel set. We propose a mechanistic interpretability module called\nDIctionary Label Attention (\\method) that disentangles uninterpretable dense\nembeddings into a sparse embedding space, where each nonzero element (a\ndictionary feature) represents a globally learned medical concept. Through\nhuman evaluations, we show that our sparse embeddings are more human\nunderstandable than its dense counterparts by at least 50 percent. Our\nautomated dictionary feature identification pipeline, leveraging large language\nmodels (LLMs), uncovers thousands of learned medical concepts by examining and\nsummarizing the highest activating tokens for each dictionary feature. We\nrepresent the relationships between dictionary features and medical codes\nthrough a sparse interpretable matrix, enhancing the mechanistic and global\nunderstanding of the model's predictions while maintaining competitive\nperformance and scalability without extensive human annotation.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10504v1) |\n| Causal Language Modeling Can Elicit Search and Reasoning Capabilities on\n  Logic Puzzles | Kulin Shah, Nishanth Dikkala, Xin Wang, Rina Panigrahy |   Causal language modeling using the Transformer architecture has yielded\nremarkable capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) over the last few\nyears. However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning\ncapabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this\nwork, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as\nsolving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to\nsearch over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then\napply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the\napplication of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in\na cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases,\nmultiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We\nobserve that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn\nto solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21\\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly)\nwhen trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that\ntraining Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and\nwithout such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis\nto Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves\n$92.04 \\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal\nrepresentations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear\nprobing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any\ngiven cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine\nimplicit in the Transformer weights.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10502v1) |\n| Alignment with nonlinear velocity couplings: collision-avoidance and\n  micro-to-macro mean-field limits | Young-Pil Choi, Micha\u0142 Fabisiak, Jan Peszek |   We investigate the pressureless fractional Euler-alignment system with\nnonlinear velocity couplings, referred to as the $p$-Euler-alignment system.\nThis model features a nonlinear velocity alignment force, interpreted as a\ndensity-weighted fractional $p$-Laplacian when the singularity parameter\n$\\alpha$ exceeds the spatial dimension $d$. Our primary goal is to establish\nthe existence of solutions for strongly singular interactions ($\\alpha \\ge d$)\nand compactly supported initial conditions. We construct solutions as\nmean-field limits of empirical measures from a kinetic variant of the\n$p$-Euler-alignment system. Specifically, we show that a sequence of empirical\nmeasures converges to a finite Radon measure, whose local density and velocity\nsatisfy the $p$-Euler-alignment system. Our results are the first to prove the\nexistence of solutions to this system in multi-dimensional settings without\nsignificant initial data restrictions, covering both nonlinear ($p>2$) and\nlinear ($p=2$) cases. Additionally, we establish global existence, uniqueness,\nand collision avoidance for the corresponding particle ODE system under\nnon-collisional initial conditions, extending previous results for $1 \\le p \\le\n\\alpha + 2$. This analysis supports our mean-field limit argument and\ncontributes to understanding alignment models with singular communication.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10501v1) |\n| Focus diverse phase retrieval test results on broadband continuous\n  wavefront sensing in space telescope applications | Hyukmo Kang, Kyle Van Gorkom, Meghdoot Biswas, Daewook Kim, Ewan S. Douglas |   Continuous wavefront sensing benefits space observatories in on-orbit optical\nperformance maintenance. To measure the phase of a wavefront, phase retrieval\nis an attractive technique as it uses multiple point spread function (PSF)\nimages that are acquired by the telescope itself without extra metrology\nsystems nor complicated calibration. The focus diverse phase retrieval utilizes\nPSFs from predetermined defocused positions to enhance the dynamic range of the\nalgorithm. We describe an updated visible light active optics testbed with the\naddition of a linear motorized focus stage. The performance of the phase\nretrieval algorithm in broadband is tested under various cases. While broadband\npass filters have advantages in higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the\nperformance of phase retrieval can be restricted due to blurred image caused by\ndiffraction and increased computing cost. We used multiple bandpass filters (10\nnm, 88 nm, and 150 nm) and investigated effects of bandwidth on the accuracy\nand required image acquisition conditions such as SNR, reaching accuracies\nbelow 20 nm RMS wavefront error at the widest bandwidth. We also investigated\nthe dynamic range of the phase retrieval algorithm depending on the bandwidth\nand required amount of defocus to expand dynamic range. Finally, we simulated\nthe continuous wavefront sensing and correction loop with a range of\nstatistically generated representative telescope disturbance time series to\ntest for edge cases.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10500v1) |\n| The role of higher-order terms in trapped-ion quantum computing with\n  magnetic gradient induced coupling | Sebastian Nagies, Kevin T. Geier, Javed Akram, Junichi Okamoto, Dimitris Badounas, Christof Wunderlich, Michael Johanning, Philipp Hauke |   Trapped-ion hardware based on the Magnetic Gradient Induced Coupling (MAGIC)\nscheme is emerging as a promising platform for quantum computing. Nevertheless,\nin this (as in any other) quantum-computing platform, many technical questions\nstill have to be resolved before large-scale and error-tolerant applications\nare possible. In this work, we present a thorough discussion of the\ncontribution of higher-order terms to the MAGIC setup, which can occur due to\nanharmonicities in the external potential of the ion crystal (e.g., through\nCoulomb repulsion) or through curvature of the applied magnetic field. These\nterms take the form of three-spin couplings as well as diverse terms that\ncouple spins to phonons. We find that most of these are negligible in realistic\nsituations, with only two contributions that need careful attention. First,\nthere are parasitic longitudinal fields whose strength increases with chain\nlength, but which can easily be compensated by a microwave detuning. Second,\nanharmonicities of the Coulomb interaction can lead to well-known two-to-one\nconversions of phonon excitations, which can be avoided if the phonons are\nground-state cooled. Our detailed analysis constitutes an important\ncontribution on the way of making magnetic-gradient trapped-ion quantum\ntechnology fit for large-scale applications, and it may inspire new ways to\npurposefully design interaction terms.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10498v1) |\n| MusicLIME: Explainable Multimodal Music Understanding | Theodoros Sotirou, Vassilis Lyberatos, Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Stamou |   Multimodal models are critical for music understanding tasks, as they capture\nthe complex interplay between audio and lyrics. However, as these models become\nmore prevalent, the need for explainability grows-understanding how these\nsystems make decisions is vital for ensuring fairness, reducing bias, and\nfostering trust. In this paper, we introduce MusicLIME, a model-agnostic\nfeature importance explanation method designed for multimodal music models.\nUnlike traditional unimodal methods, which analyze each modality separately\nwithout considering the interaction between them, often leading to incomplete\nor misleading explanations, MusicLIME reveals how audio and lyrical features\ninteract and contribute to predictions, providing a holistic view of the\nmodel's decision-making. Additionally, we enhance local explanations by\naggregating them into global explanations, giving users a broader perspective\nof model behavior. Through this work, we contribute to improving the\ninterpretability of multimodal music models, empowering users to make informed\nchoices, and fostering more equitable, fair, and transparent music\nunderstanding systems.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10496v1) |\n| Incorporating Classifier-Free Guidance in Diffusion Model-Based\n  Recommendation | Noah Buchanan, Susan Gauch, Quan Mai |   This paper presents a diffusion-based recommender system that incorporates\nclassifier-free guidance. Most current recommender systems provide\nrecommendations using conventional methods such as collaborative or\ncontent-based filtering. Diffusion is a new approach to generative AI that\nimproves on previous generative AI approaches such as Variational Autoencoders\n(VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

We study the\nrenormalizability of this theory in the framework of the Batalin-Vilkovisky\nformalism, which allows for a gauge invariant renormalization. Using the\nbackground field method, we discuss the gauge invariance of the background\neffective action and analyze the Ward identities which reflect the symmetries\nof the EC theory.

Through a comparative analysis, we\nassess the performance of emerging LLMs, specifically Llama, CodeLlama, Gemma,\nand CodeGemma, alongside established state-of-the-art models such as BERT,\nRoBERTa, and GPT-3. Our study aims to shed light on the capabilities of LLMs in\nvulnerability detection, contributing to the enhancement of software security\npractices across diverse open-source repositories.

Our paper aims to investigate if VLMs\npre-trained on web-scale data learn to encode object states, which can be\nextracted with zero-shot text prompts. We curate an object state recognition\ndataset ChangeIt-Frames, and evaluate nine open-source VLMs, including models\ntrained with contrastive and generative objectives. We observe that while these\nstate-of-the-art vision-language models can reliably perform object\nrecognition, they consistently fail to accurately distinguish the objects'\nphysical states. Through extensive experiments, we identify three areas for\nimprovements for VLMs to better encode object states, namely the quality of\nobject localization, the architecture to bind concepts to objects, and the\nobjective to learn discriminative visual and language encoders on object\nstates.

Ruan, Michael Eracleous, Daryl Haggard, Jessie C. Runnoe |   The physical processes that produce X-ray Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs)\nrecently discovered from the nuclei of several low-redshift galaxies are\nmysterious. Several pieces of observational evidence strongly suggest a link\nbetween QPEs and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE). Previous studies also reveal\nthat the morphologies of TDE host galaxies are highly concentrated, with high\nSersic indicies, bulge-to-total light (B/T) ratios, and stellar surface mass\ndensities relative to the broader galaxy population. We use these distinctive\nproperties to test the link between QPEs and TDEs, by comparing these\nparameters of QPE host galaxies to TDE host galaxies. We employ archival Legacy\nSurvey images of a sample of 9 QPE host galaxies and a sample of 13 TDE host\ngalaxies, and model their surface brightness profiles. We show that QPE host\ngalaxies have high Sersic indices of ~3, high B/T ratios of ~0.5, and high\nsurface mass densities of ~10^10 Msun kpc^-2. These properties are similar to\nTDE host galaxies, but are in strong contrast to a mass- and redshift-matched\ncontrol sample of galaxies. We also find tentative evidence that the central\nblack holes in both QPE and TDE host galaxies are undermassive relative to\ntheir stellar mass. The morphological similarities between QPE and TDE host\ngalaxies at the population level add to the mounting evidence of a physical\nlink between these phenomena, and favor QPE models that also invoke TDEs.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10486v1) |\n| Tuning the Rate of Tightly Packed Systems To Produce Planet Occurrence\n  Trends with Galactic Height | Sarah Ballard |   The formation of planetary systems has historically been considered in\nisolation, decoupled from processes on galactic scales. Recent findings\nemploying data from ESA's Gaia mission challenge this narrative, identifying\ntrends in planet occurrence with galactic kinematics and stellar age. The\nfindings indicate changes in planet occurrence over and above the predicted\nchanges from metallicity variation within the Milky Way, so that changes to\nstellar metallicity alone (long understood to be deterministic in planet\noutcomes) cannot explain the trends entirely. The scope of potential factors\ninfluencing planet formation has grown progressively wider, with accompanying\ntheoretical support for galactic-scale influences upon planet formation. In\nthis manuscript, we investigate specifically how changes to the rate of Systems\nof Tightly-packed Inner Planets (STIPs) could manifest as a trend in planet\noccurrence with galactic height. We focus our study upon M dwarf planetary\nsystems for two reasons: first, they host STIPs at high rates, and secondly,\ntheir longevity makes them useful probes for kinematic trends over Gyr. We\nconsider two models for a varying STIP rate: one in which STIP likelihood is\ndetermined by stellar age alone, irrespective of galactic time, and another in\nwhich the STIP likelihood suddenly increased in recent galactic history. Both\nmodels, which impose a higher STIP likelihood among younger stars, produce a\nnegative gradient in planet occurrence with increasing height from the galactic\nmidplane. We find that a step function model in which STIP likelihood increased\nby a factor of several ~a few Gyr ago resembles an observed trend among FGK\ndwarfs. We consider plausible physical mechanisms that could mimic the\nhypothesized model, given known links between STIP occurrence and other stellar\nand planetary properties.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10485v1) |\n| XLM for Autonomous Driving Systems: A Comprehensive Review | Sonda Fourati, Wael Jaafar, Noura Baccar, Safwan Alfattani |   Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable proficiency in various\ninformation-processing tasks. These tasks span from extracting data and\nsummarizing literature to generating content, predictive modeling,\ndecision-making, and system controls. Moreover, Vision Large Models (VLMs) and\nMultimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which represent the next generation of language\nmodels, a.k.a., XLMs, can combine and integrate many data modalities with the\nstrength of language understanding, thus advancing several information-based\nsystems, such as Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS).

Fay, Nicolas Ferr\u00e9, Miquel Huix-Rotllant |   Electronic polarization and dispersion are decisive actors in determining\ninteraction energies between molecules. These interactions have a particularly\nprofound effect on excitation energies of molecules in complex environments,\nespecially when the excitation involves a significant degree of charge\nreorganisation. The direct reaction field (DRF) approach, which has seen a\nrecent revival of interest, provides a powerful framework for describing these\ninteractions in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models of\nsystems, where a small subsystem of interest is described using quantum\nchemical methods and the remainder is treated with a simple MM force field. In\nthis paper we show how the DRF approach can be combined with the electrostatic\npotential fitted (ESPF) multipole operator description of the QM region charge\ndensity, which reduces the scaling $\\mathcal{O}(N_\\mathrm{MM}^3)$ of the method\nwith MM system to $\\mathcal{O}(N_\\mathrm{MM}^2)$. We also show how the DRF\napproach can be combined with fluctuating charge descriptions of the\npolarizable environment, as well as previously used atom-centred\ndipole-polarizability based models. We further show that the ESPF-DRF method\nprovides an accurate description of molecular interactions in both ground and\nexcited electronic states of the QM system and apply it to predict the gas to\naqueous solution solvatochromic shifts in the UV/visible absorption spectrum of\nacrolein.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10483v1) |\n| Schrodinger's Memory: Large Language Models | Wei Wang, Qing Li |   Memory is the foundation of LLMs' functionality, yet past research has lacked\nan in-depth exploration of their memory capabilities and underlying theory.

Additionally, 3DFR algorithms follow various strategies\nto address the reconstruction of a 3D shape from 2D data, such as statistical\nmodel fitting, photometric stereo, or deep learning. In the present study, we\nexplore the application of three 3DFR algorithms representative of the SOTA,\nemploying each one as the template set generator for a face verification\nsystem. The scores provided by each system are combined by score-level fusion.\nWe show that the complementarity induced by different 3DFR algorithms improves\nperformance when tests are conducted at never-seen-before distances from the\ncamera and camera characteristics (cross-distance and cross-camera settings),\nthus encouraging further investigations on multiple 3DFR-based approaches.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10481v1) |\n| Addressing misspecification in contextual optimization | Omar Bennouna, Jiawei Zhang, Saurabh Amin, Asuman Ozdaglar |   We study a linear contextual optimization problem where a decision maker has\naccess to historical data and contextual features to learn a cost prediction\nmodel aimed at minimizing decision error.

Given that perfect model alignment with reality is\noften unrealistic in practice, we focus on scenarios where the chosen\nhypothesis set is misspecified. In this context, it remains unclear whether\ncurrent contextual optimization approaches can effectively address such model\nmisspecification. In this paper, we present a novel integrated learning and\noptimization approach designed to tackle model misspecification in contextual\noptimization. This approach offers theoretical generalizability, tractability,\nand optimality guarantees, along with strong practical performance. Our method\ninvolves minimizing a tractable surrogate loss that aligns with the performance\nvalue from cost vector predictions, regardless of whether the model\nmisspecified or not, and can be optimized in reasonable time.

One of the classical and popular approaches is Local\nStochastic Gradient Descent (Local SGD), characterized by multiple local\nupdates before averaging, which is particularly useful in distributed\nenvironments to reduce communication bottlenecks and improve scalability. A\ntypical feature of this method is the dependence on the frequency of\ncommunications. But in the case of a quadratic target function with homogeneous\ndata distribution over all devices, the influence of frequency of\ncommunications vanishes. As a natural consequence, subsequent studies include\nthe assumption of a Lipschitz Hessian, as this indicates the similarity of the\noptimized function to a quadratic one to some extent. However, in order to\nextend the completeness of the Local SGD theory and unlock its potential, in\nthis paper we abandon the Lipschitz Hessian assumption by introducing a new\nconcept of $\\textit{approximate quadraticity}$. This assumption gives a new\nperspective on problems that have near quadratic properties. In addition,\nexisting theoretical analyses of Local SGD often assume bounded variance. We,\nin turn, consider the unbounded noise condition, which allows us to broaden the\nclass of studied problems.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10478v1) |\n| SimInversion: A Simple Framework for Inversion-Based Text-to-Image\n  Editing | Qi Qian, Haiyang Xu, Ming Yan, Juhua Hu |   Diffusion models demonstrate impressive image generation performance with\ntext guidance. Inspired by the learning process of diffusion, existing images\ncan be edited according to text by DDIM inversion. However, the vanilla DDIM\ninversion is not optimized for classifier-free guidance and the accumulated\nerror will result in the undesired performance. While many algorithms are\ndeveloped to improve the framework of DDIM inversion for editing, in this work,\nwe investigate the approximation error in DDIM inversion and propose to\ndisentangle the guidance scale for the source and target branches to reduce the\nerror while keeping the original framework. Moreover, a better guidance scale\n(i.e., 0.5) than default settings can be derived theoretically. Experiments on\nPIE-Bench show that our proposal can improve the performance of DDIM inversion\ndramatically without sacrificing efficiency.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10476v1) |\n| Leadership and Engagement Dynamics in Legislative Twitter Networks:\n  Statistical Analysis and Modeling | Carolina Luque, Juan Sosa |   In this manuscript, we analyze the interaction network on Twitter among\nmembers of the 117th U.S. Congress to assess the visibility of political\nleaders and explore how systemic properties and node attributes influence the\nformation of legislative connections. We employ descriptive social network\nstatistical methods, the exponential random graph model (ERGM), and the\nstochastic block model (SBM) to evaluate the relative impact of network\nsystemic properties, as well as institutional and personal traits, on the\ngeneration of online relationships among legislators. Our findings reveal that\nlegislative networks on social media platforms like Twitter tend to reinforce\nthe leadership of dominant political actors rather than diminishing their\ninfluence. However, we identify that these leadership roles can manifest in\nvarious forms. Additionally, we highlight that online connections within\nlegislative networks are influenced by both the systemic properties of the\nnetwork and institutional characteristics.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10475v1) |\n| MacDiff: Unified Skeleton Modeling with Masked Conditional Diffusion | Lehong Wu, Lilang Lin, Jiahang Zhang, Yiyang Ma, Jiaying Liu |   Self-supervised learning has proved effective for skeleton-based human action\nunderstanding. However, previous works either rely on contrastive learning that\nsuffers false negative problems or are based on reconstruction that learns too\nmuch unessential low-level clues, leading to limited representations for\ndownstream tasks. Recently, great advances have been made in generative\nlearning, which is naturally a challenging yet meaningful pretext task to model\nthe general underlying data distributions. However, the representation learning\ncapacity of generative models is under-explored, especially for the skeletons\nwith spacial sparsity and temporal redundancy. To this end, we propose Masked\nConditional Diffusion (MacDiff) as a unified framework for human skeleton\nmodeling. For the first time, we leverage diffusion models as effective\nskeleton representation learners. Specifically, we train a diffusion decoder\nconditioned on the representations extracted by a semantic encoder. Random\nmasking is applied to encoder inputs to introduce a information bottleneck and\nremove redundancy of skeletons. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that\nour generative objective involves the contrastive learning objective which\naligns the masked and noisy views. Meanwhile, it also enforces the\nrepresentation to complement for the noisy view, leading to better\ngeneralization performance. MacDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nrepresentation learning benchmarks while maintaining the competence for\ngenerative tasks. Moreover, we leverage the diffusion model for data\naugmentation, significantly enhancing the fine-tuning performance in scenarios\nwith scarce labeled data.

Hassan |   The proliferation of open Pre-trained Language Models (PTLMs) on model\nregistry platforms like Hugging Face (HF) presents both opportunities and\nchallenges for companies building products around them. Similar to traditional\nsoftware dependencies, PTLMs continue to evolve after a release. However, the\ncurrent state of release practices of PTLMs on model registry platforms are\nplagued by a variety of inconsistencies, such as ambiguous naming conventions\nand inaccessible model training documentation. Given the knowledge gap on\ncurrent PTLM release practices, our empirical study uses a mixed-methods\napproach to analyze the releases of 52,227 PTLMs on the most well-known model\nregistry, HF. Our results reveal 148 different naming practices for PTLM\nreleases, with 40.87% of changes to model weight files not represented in the\nadopted name-based versioning practice or their documentation. In addition, we\nidentified that the 52,227 PTLMs are derived from only 299 different base\nmodels (the modified original models used to create 52,227 PTLMs), with\nFine-tuning and Quantization being the most prevalent modification methods\napplied to these base models. Significant gaps in release transparency, in\nterms of training dataset specifications and model card availability, still\nexist, highlighting the need for standardized documentation. While we\nidentified a model naming practice explicitly differentiating between major and\nminor PTLM releases, we did not find any significant difference in the types of\nchanges that went into either type of releases, suggesting that major/minor\nversion numbers for PTLMs often are chosen arbitrarily. Our findings provide\nvaluable insights to improve PTLM release practices, nudging the field towards\nmore formal semantic versioning practices.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10472v1) |\n| Real-Time Whole-Body Control of Legged Robots with Model-Predictive Path\n  Integral Control | Juan Alvarez-Padilla, John Z.

Motivated by\nrecent advancements in robot simulation, we leverage the efficient\nparallelization capabilities of the MuJoCo simulator to achieve fast sampling\nover the robot state and action trajectories. Our results show surprisingly\neffective real-world locomotion and manipulation capabilities with a very\nsimple control strategy. We demonstrate our approach on several hardware and\nsimulation experiments: robust locomotion over flat and uneven terrains,\nclimbing over a box whose height is comparable to the robot, and pushing a box\nto a goal position. To our knowledge, this is the first successful deployment\nof whole-body sampling-based MPC on real-world legged robot hardware.\nExperiment videos and code can be found at: https://whole-body-mppi.github.io/\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10469v1) |\n| Assortativity in sympatric speciation and species classification | Joao U. F. Lizarraga, Flavia M. D. Marquitti, Marcus A. M. de Aguiar |   We investigate the role of assortative mating in speciation using the\nsympatric model of Derrida and Higgs. The model explores the idea that genetic\ndifferences create incompatibilities between individuals, preventing mating if\nthe number of such differences is too large. Speciation, however, only happens\nin this mating system if the number of genes is large. Here we show that\nspeciation with small genome sizes can occur if assortative mating is\nintroduced. In our model individuals are represented by three chromosomes: one\nresponsible for reproductive compatibility, one for coding the trait on which\nassortativity will operate, and a neutral chromosome. Reproduction is possible\nif individuals are genetically similar with respect to the first chromosome,\nbut among these compatible mating partners, the one with the most similar trait\ncoded by the second chromosome is selected. We show that this type of\nassortativity facilitates speciation, which can happen with a small number of\ngenes in the first chromosome. Species, classified according to reproductive\nisolation, dictated by the first chromosome, can display different traits\nvalues, as measured by the second and the third chromosomes. Therefore, species\ncan also be identified based on similarity of the neutral trait, which works as\na proxy for reproductive isolation.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10466v1) |\n| A stabilized total pressure-formulation of the Biot's poroelasticity\n  equations in frequency domain: numerical analysis and applications | Cristian C\u00e1rcamo, Alfonso Caiazzo, Felipe Galarce, Joaqu\u00edn Mura |   This work focuses on the numerical solution of the dynamics of a poroelastic\nmaterial in the frequency domain. We provide a detailed stability analysis\nbased on the application of the Fredholm alternative in the continuous case,\nconsidering a total pressure formulation of the Biot's equations. In the\ndiscrete setting, we propose a stabilized equal order finite element method\ncomplemented by an additional pressure stabilization to enhance the robustness\nof the numerical scheme with respect to the fluid permeability. Utilizing the\nFredholm alternative, we extend the well-posedness results to the discrete\nsetting, obtaining theoretical optimal convergence for the case of linear\nfinite elements. We present different numerical experiments to validate the\nproposed method. First, we consider model problems with known analytic\nsolutions in two and three dimensions. As next, we show that the method is\nrobust for a wide range of permeabilities, including the case of discontinuous\ncoefficients. Lastly, we show the application for the simulation of brain\nelastography on a realistic brain geometry obtained from medical imaging.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10465v1) |\n| New Direct Sum Tests | Alek Westover, Edward Yu, Kai Zheng |   A function $f:[n]^{d} \\to \\mathbb{F}_2$ is a \\defn{direct sum} if there are\nfunctions $L_i:[n]\\to \\mathbb{F}_2$ such that ${f(x) = \\sum_{i}L_i(x_i)}$. In\nthis work we give multiple results related to the property testing of direct\nsums.\n  Our first result concerns a test proposed by Dinur and Golubev in 2019. We\ncall their test the Diamond test and show that it is indeed a direct sum\ntester. More specifically, we show that if a function $f$ is $\\epsilon$-far\nfrom being a direct sum function, then the Diamond test rejects $f$ with\nprobability at least $\\Omega_{n,\\epsilon}(1)$. Even in the case of $n = 2$, the\nDiamond test is, to the best of our knowledge, novel and yields a new tester\nfor the classic property of affinity.\n  Apart from the Diamond test, we also analyze a broad family of direct sum\ntests, which at a high level, run an arbitrary affinity test on the restriction\nof $f$ to a random hypercube inside of $[n]^d$. This family of tests includes\nthe direct sum test analyzed in \\cite{di19}, but does not include the Diamond\ntest. As an application of our result, we obtain a direct sum test which works\nin the online adversary model of \\cite{KRV}.\n  Finally, we also discuss a Fourier analytic interpretation of the diamond\ntester in the $n=2$ case, as well as prove local correction results for direct\nsum as conjectured by Dinur and Golubev.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10464v1) |\n| Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks in Low-Data Regimes: A Comparative Study with\n  Multilayer Perceptrons | Farhad Pourkamali-Anaraki |   Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) have long been a cornerstone in deep learning,\nknown for their capacity to model complex relationships. Recently,\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a compelling alternative,\nutilizing highly flexible learnable activation functions directly on network\nedges, a departure from the neuron-centric approach of MLPs. However, KANs\nsignificantly increase the number of learnable parameters, raising concerns\nabout their effectiveness in data-scarce environments. This paper presents a\ncomprehensive comparative study of MLPs and KANs from both algorithmic and\nexperimental perspectives, with a focus on low-data regimes. We introduce an\neffective technique for designing MLPs with unique, parameterized activation\nfunctions for each neuron, enabling a more balanced comparison with KANs. Using\nempirical evaluations on simulated data and two real-world data sets from\nmedicine and engineering, we explore the trade-offs between model complexity\nand accuracy, with particular attention to the role of network depth. Our\nfindings show that MLPs with individualized activation functions achieve\nsignificantly higher predictive accuracy with only a modest increase in\nparameters, especially when the sample size is limited to around one hundred.\nFor example, in a three-class classification problem within additive\nmanufacturing, MLPs achieve a median accuracy of 0.91, significantly\noutperforming KANs, which only reach a median accuracy of 0.53 with default\nhyperparameters. These results offer valuable insights into the impact of\nactivation function selection in neural networks.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10463v1) |\n| Effects of synapse location, delay and background stochastic activity on\n  synchronising hippocampal CA1 neurons | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore |   We study the synchronisation of neurons in a realistic model under the\nHodgkin-Huxley dynamics. To focus on the role of the different locations of the\nexcitatory synapses, we use two identical neurons where the set of input\nsignals is grouped at two different distances from the soma. The system is\nintended to represent a CA1 hippocampal neuron in which the synapses arriving\nfrom the CA3 neurons of the trisynaptic pathway appear to be localised in the\napical dendritic region and are, in principle, either proximal or distal to the\nsoma. Synchronisation is studied using a specifically defined spiking\ncorrelation function as a function of various parameters such as the distance\nfrom the soma of one of the synaptic groups, the inhibition weight and the\nassociated activation delay. We found that the neurons' spiking activity\ndepends nonmonotonically on the relative dendritic location of the synapses and\ntheir inhibitory weight, whereas the synchronisation measure always decreases\nwith inhibition, and strongly depends on its activation time delay. The\nbackground activity on the somas results essentially independent on the\nfluctuation intensity and strongly support the importance of the balance\nbetween inhibition and excitation for neuronal synchronization.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10460v1) |\n| Efficiently Crowdsourcing Visual Importance with Punch-Hole Annotation | Minsuk Chang, Soohyun Lee, Aeri Cho, Hyeon Jeon, Seokhyeon Park, Cindy Xiong Bearfield, Jinwook Seo |   We introduce a novel crowdsourcing method for identifying important areas in\ngraphical images through punch-hole labeling. Traditional methods, such as gaze\ntrackers and mouse-based annotations, which generate continuous data, can be\nimpractical in crowdsourcing scenarios. They require many participants, and the\noutcome data can be noisy. In contrast, our method first segments the graphical\nimage with a grid and drops a portion of the patches (punch holes). Then, we\niteratively ask the labeler to validate each annotation with holes, narrowing\ndown the annotation only having the most important area. This approach aims to\nreduce annotation noise in crowdsourcing by standardizing the annotations while\nenhancing labeling efficiency and reliability. Preliminary findings from\nfundamental charts demonstrate that punch-hole labeling can effectively\npinpoint critical regions. This also highlights its potential for broader\napplication in visualization research, particularly in studying large-scale\nusers' graphical perception. Our future work aims to enhance the algorithm to\nachieve faster labeling speed and prove its utility through large-scale\nexperiments.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10459v1) |\n| Full distribution of local observables in an exactly solvable current\n  carrying steady states of a driven XXZ chain | Sandipan Manna, G J Sreejith |   Current carrying steady states of interacting spins chains exhibit rich\nstructures generated through an interplay of current induced correlations and\nenergetic constraints from the Hamiltonian. The XXZ spin chain when coupled to\nmaximally polarizing Lindblad terms admits an exact solution in a matrix\nproduct state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations\nand distributions of simple local spin observables in the non equilibrium\nsteady state (NESS). We present exact expressions for spin correlators, entropy\nper site, cumulant generating functions for distributions of local observables\nin the XX limit (Ising anisotropy $\\Delta=0$). Further, we use the exact MPS\nsolution in systems with $\\Delta>0$, to numerically exactly calculate the\nentropy, correlations, as well as distributions of spin observables in blocks\nas large as $n\\sim 200$ sites allowing an estimation of the rate functions. The\n$z$ magnetization distribution is consistant with short range spin correlations\nin the $z$ direction while the $x$-magnetization shows a double peak structure\nat larger $\\Delta$ suggesting short range ferromagnetic ordering.

Its applications\ncontinue to expand as researchers delve deeper into understanding the complex\ndynamics of ageing and its implications for society. One common approach to\ndefining the ageing intensity function is through the hazard rate or failure\nrate function, extensively explored in scholarly literature. Equally\nsignificant to the hazard rate function is the mean residual life function,\nwhich plays a crucial role in analyzing the ageing patterns exhibited by units\nor components. This article introduces the mean residual life ageing intensity\n(MRLAI) function to delve into component ageing behaviours across various\ndistributions.

Bottke, Robert Jedicke, Shantanu Naidu, Steven R. Chesley, Davide Farnocchia, Paul W. Chodas |   This work is dedicated to debias the Near-Earth Objects (NEO) population\nbased on observations from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System\n(ATLAS) telescopes. We have applied similar methods used to develop the\nrecently released NEO model generator (NEOMOD), once debiasing the NEO\npopulation using data from Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) G96 telescope. ATLAS is\ncomposed of four different telescopes. We first analyzed observational data\nfrom each of all four telescopes separately and later combined them. Our\nresults highlight main differences between CSS and ATLAS, e.g., sky coverage\nand survey power at debiasing the NEO population. ATLAS has a much larger sky\ncoverage than CSS, allowing it to find bright NEOs that would be constantly\n\"hiding\" from CSS. Consequently, ATLAS is more powerful than CSS at debiasing\nthe NEO population for H $\\lesssim$ 19. With its intrinsically greater\nsensitivity and emphasis on observing near opposition, CSS excels in the\ndebiasing of smaller objects. ATLAS, as an all sky survey designed to find\nimminent hazardous objects, necessarily spends a significant fraction of time\nlooking at places on the sky where objects do not appear, reducing its power\nfor debiasing the population of small objects. We estimate a NEO population\ncompleteness of $\\approx$ 88%$^{+3\\%}_{-2\\%}$ for H $<$ 17.75 and $\\approx$\n36%$^{+1\\%}_{-1\\%}$ for H $<$ 22.25. Those numbers are similar to previous\nestimates (within error bars for H $<$ 17.75) from CSS, yet, around 3% and 8%\nsmaller at their face values, respectively. We also confirm previous finding\nthat the $\\nu_6$ secular resonance is the main source of small and faint NEOs\nat H = 28, whereas the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter dominates for\nlarger and brighter NEOs at H = 15.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10453v1) |\n| Signed Graph Autoencoder for Explainable and Polarization-Aware Network\n  Embeddings | Nikolaos Nakis, Chrysoula Kosma, Giannis Nikolentzos, Michalis Chatzianastasis, Iakovos Evdaimon, Michalis Vazirgiannis |   Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant\nattention in recent years for their ability to extract informative latent\nrepresentations, characterizing the structure of complex topologies, such as\ngraphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited\nfocus on developing and evaluating explainable neural-based graph generative\nmodels specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we\npropose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE\nextracts node-level representations that express node memberships over distinct\nextreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is\nachieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its\npolarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for\nanalyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with\nrelational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation\ndemonstrates the SGAAEs' capability to successfully infer node memberships over\nthe different underlying latent structures while extracting competing\ncommunities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the\nnetwork. Additionally, we introduce the 2-level network polarization problem\nand show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting.

In\nthis paper, we advocate that you should also apply OLS in empirical\napplications. On the one hand, we demonstrate that, with a small-sample\ncorrection, the OLS estimator is also unbiased. On the other hand, we show that\nthe MLE assigns significantly greater weight to smaller observations. This\nsuggests that the OLS estimator may outperform the MLE in cases where the\ndistribution is (i) strictly Pareto but only in the upper tail or (ii)\nregularly varying rather than strictly Pareto.

Law, Alberto Noriega-Crespo, Michael Regan |   The absolute flux calibration of the Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and\nCoronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first\n2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the\nflux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays,\nand different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining\nobserved aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions\nbased on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of\nthese observations were combined with model point-spread-functions to measure\nthe corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with\ntime, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time,\nrate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations\nwere with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately\nevery month revealed a modest time-dependent response loss seen mainly at the\nlongest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential\nwith a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the\nband-dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was\nfound to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different\nsubarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting\nfor the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors\nmeasured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band.

Yip |   Camera-to-robot calibration is crucial for vision-based robot control and\nrequires effort to make it accurate. Recent advancements in markerless pose\nestimation methods have eliminated the need for time-consuming physical setups\nfor camera-to-robot calibration. While the existing markerless pose estimation\nmethods have demonstrated impressive accuracy without the need for cumbersome\nsetups, they rely on the assumption that all the robot joints are visible\nwithin the camera's field of view. However, in practice, robots usually move in\nand out of view, and some portion of the robot may stay out-of-frame during the\nwhole manipulation task due to real-world constraints, leading to a lack of\nsufficient visual features and subsequent failure of these approaches. To\naddress this challenge and enhance the applicability to vision-based robot\ncontrol, we propose a novel framework capable of estimating the robot pose with\npartially visible robot manipulators. Our approach leverages the\nVision-Language Models for fine-grained robot components detection, and\nintegrates it into a keypoint-based pose estimation network, which enables more\nrobust performance in varied operational conditions. The framework is evaluated\non both public robot datasets and self-collected partial-view datasets to\ndemonstrate our robustness and generalizability.

The topological magnons, which are indicated\nby nonzero Chern number and thermal Hall conductivity, are proposed to\npartially explain thermal Hall measurements in real materials. Hitherto,\ntopological magnons have been extensively explored when the magnetic field is\nnormal to the honeycomb plane, but their topological characteristics are less\nstudied in the presence of in-plane magnetic field. Here, we study two distinct\nin-plane field induced spin-flop phases in the $\\Gamma$-$\\Gamma'$ model, both\nof which are off-diagonal couplings that have intimate relation to the Kitaev\ninteraction. The two spin-flop phases are distinguished by their out-of-plane\nspin components which can be either antiparallel or parallel, thus dubbing\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) spin-flop phases, respectively.\nWe map out topological phase diagrams for both phases, revealing a rich pattern\nof the Chern number over exchange parameters and magnetic field. We\nanalytically calculate the boundaries of topological phase transitions when the\nmagnetic field is along the $a$ and $b$ directions. We find that the thermal\nHall conductivity and its derivative display contrasting behaviors when\ncrossing different topological phase transitions. The striking difference of\nthe two phases lies in that when the magnetic field is along the $b$ direction,\ntopological magnons are totally absent in the AFM spin-flop phase, while they\ncan survive in the FM analogue in certain parameter regions.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10439v1) |\n| A functorial approach to $n$-abelian categories | Vitor Gulisz |   We develop a functorial approach to the study of $n$-abelian categories by\nreformulating their axioms in terms of their categories of finitely presented\nfunctors. Such an approach allows the use of classical homological algebra and\nrepresentation theory techniques to understand higher homological algebra. As\nan application, we present two possible generalizations of the axioms \"every\nmonomorphism is a kernel\" and \"every epimorphism is a cokernel\" of an abelian\ncategory to $n$-abelian categories. We also specialize our results to modules\nover rings, thereby describing when the category of finitely generated\nprojective modules over a ring is $n$-abelian. Moreover, we establish a\ncorrespondence for $n$-abelian categories with additive generators, which\nextends the higher Auslander correspondence.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10438v1) |\n| Color symmetry breaking in the Potts spin glass | Jean-Christophe Mourrat |   The Potts spin glass is an analogue of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model in\nwhich each spin can take one of $\\kappa$ possible values, which we interpret as\ncolors.

Whole genome sequence data augmented with demographic metadata\nprovides the best opportunity to do this.

Comparing periods in versus out of \"lockdown\"\nrestrictions, we show using genetic distance relationships that individuals\nfrom more deprived areas are more likely to get infected during lockdown but\nless likely to spread the infection further.

The vast majority of\nenergy-preserving reduced-order methods use symplectic Galerkin projection to\nconstruct reduced-order Hamiltonian models by projecting the full models onto a\nsymplectic subspace. However, symplectic projection requires the existence of\nfully discrete operators, and in many cases, such as black-box PDE solvers,\nthese operators are inaccessible. In this work, we propose an energy-preserving\nmachine learning method that can infer the dynamics of the given PDE using data\nonly, so that the proposed framework does not depend on the fully discrete\noperators. In this context, the proposed method is non-intrusive. The proposed\nmethod is grey box in the sense that it requires only some basic knowledge of\nthe multi-symplectic model at the partial differential equation level. We prove\nthat the proposed method satisfies spatially discrete local energy conservation\nand preserves the multi-symplectic conservation laws. We test our method on the\nlinear wave equation, the Korteweg-de Vries equation, and the\nZakharov-Kuznetsov equation. We test the generalization of our learned models\nby testing them far outside the training time interval.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10432v1) |\n| Hippocampal synchronization in a realistic CA1 neuron model | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore |   This work delves into studying the synchronization in two realistic neuron\nmodels using Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics. Unlike simplistic point-like models,\nexcitatory synapses are here randomly distributed along the dendrites,\nintroducing strong stochastic contributions into their signal propagation. To\nfocus on the role of different excitatory positions, we use two copies of the\nsame neuron whose synapses are located at different distances from the soma and\nare exposed to identical Poissonian distributed current pulses. The\nsynchronization is investigated through a specifically defined spiking\ncorrelation function, and its behavior is analyzed as a function of several\nparameters: inhibition weight, distance from the soma of one synaptic group,\nexcitatory inactivation delay, and weight of the excitatory synapses.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10431v1) |\n| Meta-Whisper: Speech-Based Meta-ICL for ASR on Low-Resource Languages | Ming-Hao Hsu, Kuan Po Huang, Hung-yi Lee |   This paper presents Meta-Whisper, a novel approach to improve automatic\nspeech recognition (ASR) for low-resource languages using the Whisper model. By\nleveraging Meta In-Context Learning (Meta-ICL) and a k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\nalgorithm for sample selection, Meta-Whisper enhances Whisper's ability to\nrecognize speech in unfamiliar languages without extensive fine-tuning.\nExperiments on the ML-SUPERB dataset show that Meta-Whisper significantly\nreduces the Character Error Rate (CER) for low-resource languages compared to\nthe original Whisper model.

This approach mitigates risks\nassociated with compromised or untrusted devices, common in traditional quantum\ncommunication.\n  In this paper, we propose the first of its kind DI-QSDC protocol with user\nidentity authentication. This ensures the authenticity of both the sender and\nreceiver prior to message exchange. We then discuss the security of the\nproposed protocol against common attacks, demonstrating that no eavesdropper\ngains any information from either the quantum or the classical channel. Next,\nwe implement the protocol on IBM's quantum hardware and evaluate its\nperformance in a realistic noisy environment. Additionally, by simulating\ncommon attack models, we showcase that the protocol is secure against any\neavesdropper in the channel. These findings highlight the protocol's robust\nsecurity and practical feasibility for real-world secure quantum communication.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10427v1) |\n| Role of kinematic constraints in the time reversal symmetry breaking of\n  a model active matter | Soumen Das, Shankar Ghosh, Tridib Sadhu, Juliane U Klamser |   Active-matter systems are inherently out-of-equilibrium and perform\nmechanical work by utilizing their internal energy sources. Breakdown of\ntime-reversal symmetry (BTRS) is a hallmark of such dissipative non-equilibrium\ndynamics. We introduce a robust, experimentally accessible, noninvasive,\nquantitative measure of BTRS in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in\ncollision events, demonstrated in our novel artificial active matter, comprised\nof battery-powered spherical rolling robots whose energetics in different modes\nof motion can be measured with high precision. Our dimensionless measure\ncharacterizes how dissipation and internal energetics are influenced by\nkinematic constraints from interactions with the environment. We propose this\nmeasure of BTRS as an empirical estimate of the distance from equilibrium. An\nenergetic insight into this departure of active matter from equilibrium comes\nfrom our demonstration of a non-trivial fluctuation symmetry, which reveals a\npotentially universal thermodynamic characteristic of active energetics. As a\nmany-body consequence of BTRS in our experimental active system, we demonstrate\nthe emergence of activity-induced herding, which has no equilibrium analogue.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10425v1) |\n| Unveiling V Modes: Enhancing CMB Sensitivity to BSM Physics with a\n  Non-Ideal Half-Wave Plate | N. Raffuzzi, M. Lembo, S. Giardiello, M. Gerbino, M. Lattanzi, P. Natoli, L. Pagano |   V-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background is expected to be\nvanishingly small in the $\\Lambda$CDM model and, hence, usually ignored.\nNonetheless, several astrophysical effects, as well as beyond standard model\nphysics could produce it at a detectable level. A realistic half-wave plate -\nan optical element commonly used in CMB experiments to modulate the polarized\nsignal - can provide sensitivity to V modes without significantly spoiling that\nto linear polarization. We assess this sensitivity for some new-generation CMB\nexperiments, such as the LiteBIRD satellite, the ground-based Simons\nObservatory and a CMB-S4-like experiment. We forecast the efficiency of these\nexperiments to constrain the phenomenology of certain classes of BSM models\ninducing mixing of linear polarization states and generation of V modes in the\nCMB. We find that new-generation experiments can improve current limits by\n1-to-3 orders of magnitude, depending on the data combination.

The space-time description in the\nBondi-like coordinates is then found as a series expansion in the vicinity of\nthe horizon. To graphically illustrate this construction, we also find a\nnumerical solution for a black hole deformed by a particular analytic model of\na thin accretion disk.

However,\nstate-of-the-art methods ignore a potentially valuable source of unsupervised\nsemantic information -- spatial registration transforms between image volumes.\nTo address this, we propose CCT-R, a contrastive cross-teaching framework\nincorporating registration information. To leverage the semantic information\navailable in registrations between volume pairs, CCT-R incorporates two\nproposed modules: Registration Supervision Loss (RSL) and Registration-Enhanced\nPositive Sampling (REPS). The RSL leverages segmentation knowledge derived from\ntransforms between labeled and unlabeled volume pairs, providing an additional\nsource of pseudo-labels. REPS enhances contrastive learning by identifying\nanatomically-corresponding positives across volumes using registration\ntransforms. Experimental results on two challenging medical segmentation\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CCT-R across\nvarious semi-supervised settings, with as few as one labeled case.

A number of recent methods have shown\nhow to perform high-dimensional, unbinned unfolding using machine learning.\nHowever, one of the assumptions in all of these methods is that the detector\nresponse is accurately modeled in the Monte Carlo simulation. In practice, the\ndetector response depends on a number of nuisance parameters that can be\nconstrained with data. We propose a new algorithm called Profile OmniFold\n(POF), which works in a similar iterative manner as the OmniFold (OF) algorithm\nwhile being able to simultaneously profile the nuisance parameters.

Given a text query, RGS\ndetermines a stable grasp pose to manipulate the referred object in the robot's\nworkspace. RGS comprises two steps: visual grounding and grasp pose estimation.\nRecent studies leverage powerful Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for visually\ngrounding free-flowing natural language in real-world robotic execution.\nHowever, comparisons in complex, cluttered environments with multiple instances\nof the same object are lacking. This paper introduces HiFi-CS, featuring\nhierarchical application of Featurewise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to fuse image\nand text embeddings, enhancing visual grounding for complex attribute rich text\nqueries encountered in robotic grasping. Visual grounding associates an object\nin 2D/3D space with natural language input and is studied in two scenarios:\nClosed and Open Vocabulary. HiFi-CS features a lightweight decoder combined\nwith a frozen VLM and outperforms competitive baselines in closed vocabulary\nsettings while being 100x smaller in size. Our model can effectively guide\nopen-set object detectors like GroundedSAM to enhance open-vocabulary\nperformance.

Papoutsis, I. E. Papadakis, C. Panagiotou, M. Dov\u010diak, E. Kammoun |   Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to be variable across all\nwavelengths. Significant observational efforts have been invested in the last\ndecade in studying their ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability. Long and\ndensely sampled, multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns of numerous Seyfert\ngalaxies have been conducted with the aim of determining the X-ray/UV/optical\ncontinuum time lags. Time-lag studies can be used to constrain theoretical\nmodels. The observed time lags can be explained by thermal reprocessing of the\nX-rays illuminating the accretion disc (known as the X-ray reverberation\nmodel). However, the observed light curves contain more information that can be\nused to further constrain physical models. Our primary objective is to\ninvestigate whether, in addition to time lags, the X-ray reverberation model\ncan also explain the UV/optical variability amplitude of nearby Seyferts. To do\nthis, we measured the excess variance of four sources (namely Mrk 509, NGC\n4151, NGC 2617, and Mrk 142) as a function of wavelength using data from\narchival long, multi-wavelength campaigns with Swift, and ground-based\ntelescopes. We also computed the model excess variance in the case of the X-ray\nreverberation model by determining the disc's transfer function and assuming a\nbending power law for the X-ray power spectrum. We tested the validity of the\nmodel by comparing the measured and model variances for a range of accretion\nrates and X-ray source heights. We conclude that the X-ray thermal\nreverberation model can fit both the continuum, UV/optical time lags, as well\nas the variance in these AGNs, for the same physical parameters. Our results\nsuggest that the accretion disc is constant and that all the observed\nUV/optical variations, on timescales of days and up to a few weeks, can be\nfully explained by the variable X-rays as they illuminate the accretion disc.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10417v1) |\n| Local central limit theorem for Mallows measure | Alexey Bufetov, Kailun Chen |   We study the statistics of the Mallows measure on permutations in the limit\npioneered by Starr (2009).

However, this convenience raises substantial concerns about\nunauthorized access to users' privacy-sensitive information, which could be\nfurther abused for illegitimate purposes like user tracking or monetization.\nOur study offers a targeted analysis of user privacy protection among Android\nthird-party SDKs, filling a critical gap in the Android software supply chain.\nIt focuses on two aspects of their privacy practices, including data\nexfiltration and behavior-policy compliance (or privacy compliance), utilizing\ntechniques of taint analysis and large language models. It covers 158\nwidely-used SDKs from two key SDK release platforms, the official one and a\nlarge alternative one. From them, we identified 338 instances of privacy data\nexfiltration. On the privacy compliance, our study reveals that more than 30%\nof the examined SDKs fail to provide a privacy policy to disclose their data\nhandling practices. Among those that provide privacy policies, 37% of them\nover-collect user data, and 88% falsely claim access to sensitive data. We\nrevisit the latest versions of the SDKs after 12 months.

The former characterizes\nspike trains related to a particular triggering event, while the latter filters\nout the signal and refines the selection of the underlying neuronal response.\nTransitioning from traditional time series analysis to point process theory,\nthe study explores spike-time distance metrics and point pattern prototypes to\ndescribe repeated observations. We assume that the analyzed neuron's firing\nevents, i.e. spike occurrences, are temporal point process events. In\nparticular, the study aims to categorize 47 point patterns by depth, assuming\nthe similarity of spike occurrences within specific depth categories.

Drawing parallels from the successful application\nof Gibrat's law of proportional growth in explaining city size and word\nfrequency distributions, we tested whether the same principle could account for\nthe log-normal distribution in Bitcoin balances. However, our calculations\nrevealed that the exponent parameters in both the drift and variance terms\ndeviate slightly from one. This suggests that Gibrat's proportional growth rule\nalone does not fully explain the log-normal distribution observed in Bitcoin\nusers' balances. During our exploration, we discovered an intriguing\nphenomenon: Bitcoin users tend to fall into two distinct categories based on\ntheir behavior, which we refer to as ``poor\" and ``wealthy\" users. Poor users,\nwho initially purchase only a small amount of Bitcoin, tend to buy more\nbitcoins first and then sell out all their holdings gradually over time. The\ncertainty of selling all their coins is higher and higher with time. In\ncontrast, wealthy users, who acquire a large amount of Bitcoin from the start,\ntend to sell off their holdings over time. The speed at which they sell their\nbitcoins is lower and lower over time and they will hold at least a small part\nof their initial holdings at last. Interestingly, the wealthier the user, the\nlarger the proportion of their balance and the higher the certainty they tend\nto sell.

In meiosis II mouse oocytes (developing egg cells) awaiting\nfertilisation, the spindle, which is the protein structure responsible for\ndividing genetic material in a cell, must maintain its position near the cell\ncortex (the thin actin network bound to the cell membrane) for many hours.\nHowever, the cytoplasmic streaming that accompanies this stable positioning\nwould intuitively appear to destabilise the spindle position. Here, through a\ncombination of numerical and analytical modelling, we reveal a new,\nhydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning beneath the cortical cap.\nWe show that this stability depends critically on the spindle size and the\nactive driving from the cortex, and demonstrate that stable spindle positioning\ncan result purely from a hydrodynamic suction force exerted on the spindle by\nthe cytoplasmic flow. Our findings show that local fluid dynamic forces can be\nsufficient to stabilise the spindle, explaining robustness against\nperturbations not only perpendicular but also parallel to the cortex. Our\nresults shed light on the importance of cytoplasmic streaming in mammalian\nmeiosis.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10401v1) |\n| Sherpa: An Open Source Python Fitting Package | Aneta Siemiginowska, Douglas Burke, Hans Moritz G\u00fcnther, Nicholas P.

Dejrah |   We focus on the inflationary predictions of $\\beta$-exponential potential\nmodels, in which the inflaton is a representation of the field delineating the\nsize of extra-dimension. Since it offers a well-motivated starting point for\nthe study of physics at very high energies, we incorporate an $R^2$ term in the\nPalatini gravity. In addition, afterward the inflation, the inflaton oscillates\nabout the minimum of the inflation potential, and reheats the universe. This\noccurs during the reheating phase, at which the inflaton decays into the\nstandard model particles, which fill the universe. We extend our examination by\nconsidering the reheating effects on inflationary observables by employing the\ndifferent scenarios of the reheat temperature. Supposing the standard thermal\nhistory after inflation, we display the inflationary predictions, $n_s, r,\n\\mathrm{d}n_s/\\mathrm{d}\\ln k$ of $\\beta$-exponential potential with minimal\ncoupling in Palatini $R^2$ gravity. Also, different kinds of constraints from a\nvariety of observations, such as BICEP/Keck, Planck 2018, as well as future\npossible detectable sensitivities that might be reached by CMB experiments:\nCMB-S4 and LiteBIRD are taken into account in this work. We indicate that our\nresults are consistent with both the latest data and the future sensitivity\nforecasts of LiteBIRD/Planck and CMB-S4. Finally, the results in this study\nhighlight the viability of our model even in the case of the existence of more\nstringent constraints expected from future achievable confidence level limits.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10398v1) |\n| Quantifying Observational Projection Effects with a Simulation-based hot\n  CGM model | Soumya Shreeram, Johan Comparat, Andrea Merloni, Yi Zhang, Gabriele Ponti, Kirpal Nandra, John ZuHone, Ilaria Marini, Stephan Vladutescu-Zopp, Paola Popesso, Ruediger Pakmor, Riccardo Seppi, Celine Peroux, Daniele Sorini |   The hot phase of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) allows us to probe the\ninflow and outflow of gas within a galaxy, which is responsible for dictating\nthe evolution of the galaxy. Studying the hot CGM sheds light on a better\nunderstanding of gas physics, which is crucial to inform and constrain\nsimulation models. With the recent advances in observational measurements\nprobing the hot CGM in X-rays and tSZ, we have a new avenue for widening our\nknowledge of gas physics and feedback by exploiting the information from\ncurrent/future observations. In this paper, we use the TNG300 hydrodynamical\nsimulations to build a fully self-consistent forward model for the hot CGM. We\nconstruct a lightcone and generate mock X-ray observations. We quantify the\nprojection effects, namely the locally correlated large-scale structure in\nX-rays and the effect due to satellite galaxies misclassified as centrals which\naffects the measured hot CGM galactocentric profiles in stacking experiments.\nWe present an analytical model that describes the intrinsic X-ray surface\nbrightness profile across the stellar and halo mass bins. The increasing\nstellar mass bins result in decreasing values of $\\beta$, the exponent\nquantifying the slope of the intrinsic galactocentric profiles. We carry\nforward the current state-of-the-art by also showing the impact of the locally\ncorrelated environment on the measured X-ray surface brightness profiles.

To mitigate this issue, downstream\ntask-oriented reconstruction optimization has been proposed for a single\ndownstream task. Expanding this optimization to multi-task scenarios is not\nstraightforward. In this work, we extended this optimization to sequentially\nintroduced multiple downstream tasks and demonstrated that a single MR\nreconstruction network can be optimized for multiple downstream tasks by\ndeploying continual learning (MOST). MOST integrated techniques from\nreplay-based continual learning and image-guided loss to overcome catastrophic\nforgetting. Comparative experiments demonstrated that MOST outperformed a\nreconstruction network without finetuning, a reconstruction network with\nna\\\"ive finetuning, and conventional continual learning methods. This\nadvancement empowers the application of a single MR reconstruction network for\nmultiple downstream tasks.

In particular, we analyse the task of\n\\textit{multicopy state teleportation}, where Alice has $k$ identical copies of\nan arbitrary unknown $d$-dimensional qudit state $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ to teleport\na single copy of $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ to Bob using a maximally entangled\ntwo-qudit state shared between Alice and Bob without Bob's correction. Alice\nmay perform a joint measurement on her half of the entangled state and the $k$\ncopies of $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$. We prove that the maximal probability of success\nfor teleporting the exact state $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ to Bob is\n$p(d,k)=\\frac{k}{d(k-1+d)}$ and present an explicit protocol to attain this\nperformance. Then, by utilising $k$ copies of an arbitrary target state\n$\\vert\\psi\\rangle$, we show how the multicopy state teleportation protocol can\nbe employed to enhance the success probability of storage and retrieval of\nquantum programs, which aims to universally retrieve the action of an arbitrary\nquantum channel that is stored in a state.

The majority of work that has been\ndone is focused on Deep Learning (DL) based approaches. However, with the\nemergence of new algorithms such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm, there\nis growing interest in exploring alternative approaches that may offer unique\nadvantages in certain domains or applications. One of these domains is\nFederated Learning (FL), in which users privacy is of utmost importance. Due to\nits novelty, FL has seen a surge in the incorporation of personalization\ntechniques to enhance model accuracy while maintaining user privacy under\npersonalized conditions. In this work, we propose a novel approach dubbed TPFL:\nTsetlin-Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into\nclusters based on their confidence towards a specific class. In this way,\nclustering can benefit from two key advantages. Firstly, clients share only\nwhat they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight\naggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been\nenough during the training. This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are\nnon-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID). Secondly, by sharing\nonly weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially\nreduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication\ncost. The results of TPFL demonstrated the highest accuracy on three different\ndatasets; namely MNIST, FashionMNIST and FEMNIST.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10392v1) |\n| Prompt-and-Transfer: Dynamic Class-aware Enhancement for Few-shot\n  Segmentation | Hanbo Bi, Yingchao Feng, Wenhui Diao, Peijin Wang, Yongqiang Mao, Kun Fu, Hongqi Wang, Xian Sun |   For more efficient generalization to unseen domains (classes), most Few-shot\nSegmentation (FSS) would directly exploit pre-trained encoders and only\nfine-tune the decoder, especially in the current era of large models. However,\nsuch fixed feature encoders tend to be class-agnostic, inevitably activating\nobjects that are irrelevant to the target class. In contrast, humans can\neffortlessly focus on specific objects in the line of sight. This paper mimics\nthe visual perception pattern of human beings and proposes a novel and powerful\nprompt-driven scheme, called ``Prompt and Transfer\" (PAT), which constructs a\ndynamic class-aware prompting paradigm to tune the encoder for focusing on the\ninterested object (target class) in the current task. Three key points are\nelaborated to enhance the prompting: 1) Cross-modal linguistic information is\nintroduced to initialize prompts for each task. 2) Semantic Prompt Transfer\n(SPT) that precisely transfers the class-specific semantics within the images\nto prompts. 3) Part Mask Generator (PMG) that works in conjunction with SPT to\nadaptively generate different but complementary part prompts for different\nindividuals. Surprisingly, PAT achieves competitive performance on 4 different\ntasks including standard FSS, Cross-domain FSS (e.g., CV, medical, and remote\nsensing domains), Weak-label FSS, and Zero-shot Segmentation, setting new\nstate-of-the-arts on 11 benchmarks.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10389v1) |\n| Revising the Structure of Recurrent Neural Networks to Eliminate\n  Numerical Derivatives in Forming Physics Informed Loss Terms with Respect to\n  Time | Mahyar Jahani-nasab, Mohamad Ali Bijarchi |   Solving unsteady partial differential equations (PDEs) using recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs) typically requires numerical derivatives between each block of\nthe RNN to form the physics informed loss function. However, this introduces\nthe complexities of numerical derivatives into the training process of these\nmodels. In this study, we propose modifying the structure of the traditional\nRNN to enable the prediction of each block over a time interval, making it\npossible to calculate the derivative of the output with respect to time using\nthe backpropagation algorithm. To achieve this, the time intervals of these\nblocks are overlapped, defining a mutual loss function between them.\nAdditionally, the employment of conditional hidden states enables us to achieve\na unique solution for each block. The forget factor is utilized to control the\ninfluence of the conditional hidden state on the prediction of the subsequent\nblock. This new model, termed the Mutual Interval RNN (MI-RNN), is applied to\nsolve three different benchmarks: the Burgers equation, unsteady heat\nconduction in an irregular domain, and the Green vortex problem. Our results\ndemonstrate that MI-RNN can find the exact solution more accurately compared to\nexisting RNN models. For instance, in the second problem, MI-RNN achieved one\norder of magnitude less relative error compared to the RNN model with numerical\nderivatives.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10388v1) |\n| Sharp decay rate for eigenfunctions of perturbed periodic Schr\u00f6dinger\n  operators | Wencai Liu, Rodrigo Matos, John N.

Most of the state-of-the-art architectures\nuse transformers or diffusion-based models to perform this task, despite the\nheavy computational burden that they require. In particular, transformers use\nself- and cross-attention layers which have large memory footprint, while\ndiffusion models require high inference time. To overcome the above, this paper\nexplores a novel design of Mamba, an emergent State-Space Model (SSM), called\nMamba-ST, to perform style transfer. To do so, we adapt Mamba linear equation\nto simulate the behavior of cross-attention layers, which are able to combine\ntwo separate embeddings into a single output, but drastically reducing memory\nusage and time complexity. We modified the Mamba's inner equations so to accept\ninputs from, and combine, two separate data streams. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt the equations of SSMs to a vision\ntask like style transfer without requiring any other module like\ncross-attention or custom normalization layers. An extensive set of experiments\ndemonstrates the superiority and efficiency of our method in performing style\ntransfer compared to transformers and diffusion models.

Maiti |   We present a comprehensive study on enhancing the thermoelectric (TE)\nperformance of bilayer graphene (BLG) through irradiation with arbitrarily\npolarized light, focusing on $AA$- and $AB$-stacked configurations with zigzag\nedges. Utilizing a combination of tight-binding theory and density functional\ntheory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on\nelectronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the\nelectronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function,\nwhich significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the\noverall {\\it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT\ncalculations reveal that $AB$-stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal\nconductivity compared to $AA$-stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic\nscattering and phonon group velocity. The combined analysis shows that FOM\nexceeds unity in both stacking types, with notable improvements near the\nirradiation-induced gap. Additionally, we explore the dependence of FOM on the\nsystem dimensions and temperature, demonstrating that light-irradiated BLG\nholds great promise for efficient thermoelectric energy conversion and waste\nheat recovery. Our results show favorable responses over a wide range of\nirradiation parameters.

This study introduces\na novel statistical approach, TAR4C, to dissect causal interactions in\nmultichannel EEG recordings. TAR4C uses the threshold autoregressive model to\ndescribe the causal interaction between nodes or clusters of nodes in a brain\nnetwork. The perspective involves testing whether one node, which may represent\na brain region, can control the dynamics of the other. The node that has such\nan impact on the other is called a threshold variable and can be classified as\na causative because its functionality is the leading source operating as an\ninstantaneous switching mechanism that regulates the time-varying\nautoregressive structure of the other. This statistical concept is commonly\nreferred to as threshold non-linearity. Once threshold non-linearity has been\nverified between a pair of nodes, the subsequent essential facet of TAR\nmodeling is to assess the predictive ability of the causal node for the current\nactivity on the other and represent causal interactions in autoregressive\nterms. This predictive ability is what underlies Granger causality. The TAR4C\napproach can discover non-linear and time-dependent causal interactions without\nnegating the G-causality perspective. The efficacy of the proposed approach is\nexemplified by analyzing the EEG signals recorded during the motor\nmovement/imagery experiment. The similarities and differences between the\ncausal interactions manifesting during the execution and the imagery of a given\nmotor movement are demonstrated by analyzing EEG recordings from multiple\nsubjects.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10374v1) |\n| Instigating Cooperation among LLM Agents Using Adaptive Information\n  Modulation | Qiliang Chen,  Alireza,  Ilami, Nunzio Lore, Babak Heydari |   This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for\nhuman strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these\nagents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments.

To meet\nperformance constraints, state-of-the-art control methods such as Incremental\nNonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) or other adaptive control techniques require\nhigh control gains to mitigate the effects of uncertainty entering the system.\nWhile achieving good tracking performance, IDNI requires excessive control\neffort, results in high actuator strain, and reduced flight smoothness due to\nconstant and aggressive corrective actions commanded by the controller.

EF4INCA provides\nhigh-resolution forecasts over Austria, accurately predicting the location and\nshape of precipitation fields with a spatial resolution of 1 kilometre and a\ntemporal resolution of 5 minutes, up to 90 minutes ahead. Our evaluation shows\nthat EF4INCA outperforms conventional nowcasting models, including the\noperational model of Austria, particularly in scenarios with complex temporal\nfeatures such as convective initiation and rapid weather changes. EF4INCA\nmaintains higher accuracy in location forecasting but generates smoother fields\nat later prediction times compared to traditional models.

Integral-field\nobservations with a high spectral resolution allow us to robustly determine\ntheir low velocity dispersions ($\\sim25$ km s$^{-1}$) and higher-order\nkinematic moments out to the half-light radius. We find the dEs exhibit a\ndiversity in ages with the younger dEs being less enhanced than the older,\nsuggesting a complex star formation history for those dEs that recently entered\nVirgo while others have been quenched shortly after reionization.\nOrbit-superposition modeling allowed us to recover viewing angles, stellar\nmass-to-light ratios (with gradients), as well as the intrinsic orbit\nstructure. We find that the angular momentum of the dEs is strongly suppressed\ncompared to ordinary early-type galaxies and correlates with the environment.\nFlattened dEs are so because of a suppressed kinetic energy perpendicular to\ntheir equatorial plane. Combining population and dynamical modeling results, we\nfind an age-dependent stellar initial mass function (IMF) or, alternatively,\nevidence for a more extended star formation history for those galaxies that\nhave had higher initial mass and/or inhabited lower density environments. dEs\nappear to have a spatially homogeneous stellar structure but the state they\nwere `frozen' in as they stopped forming stars varies dramatically according to\ntheir initial conditions.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10518v1) |\n| RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Vector\n  Retrieval | Di Liu, Meng Chen, Baotong Lu, Huiqiang Jiang, Zhenhua Han, Qianxi Zhang, Qi Chen, Chengruidong Zhang, Bailu Ding, Kai Zhang, Chen Chen, Fan Yang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu |   Transformer-based large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly important\nin various domains. However, the quadratic time complexity of attention\noperation poses a significant challenge for scaling to longer contexts due to\nthe extremely high inference latency and GPU memory consumption for caching\nkey-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free\napproach to accelerate attention computation. To leverage the dynamic sparse\nproperty of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor\nsearch (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most\nrelevant ones via vector search during generation. Due to the\nout-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors, off-the-shelf\nANNS indexes still need to scan O(N) (usually 30% of all keys) data for\naccurate retrieval, which fails to exploit the high sparsity.\nRetrievalAttention first identifies the OOD challenge of ANNS-based attention,\nand addresses it via an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt\nto queries and only access 1--3% of data, thus achieving a sub-linear time\ncomplexity. RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of\nlong-context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the\nmodel accuracy. Especially, RetrievalAttention only needs 16GB GPU memory for\nserving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating\none token in 0.188 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB).\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516v1) |\n| An Efficient Self-Learning Framework For Interactive Spoken Dialog\n  Systems | Hitesh Tulsiani, David M. Chan, Shalini Ghosh, Garima Lalwani, Prabhat Pandey, Ankish Bansal, Sri Garimella, Ariya Rastrow, Bj\u00f6rn Hoffmeister |   Dialog systems, such as voice assistants, are expected to engage with users\nin complex, evolving conversations. Unfortunately, traditional automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) systems deployed in such applications are usually trained to\nrecognize each turn independently and lack the ability to adapt to the\nconversational context or incorporate user feedback. In this work, we introduce\na general framework for ASR in dialog systems that can go beyond learning from\nsingle-turn utterances and learn over time how to adapt to both explicit\nsupervision and implicit user feedback present in multi-turn conversations. We\naccomplish that by leveraging advances in student-teacher learning and\ncontext-aware dialog processing, and designing contrastive self-supervision\napproaches with Ohm, a new online hard-negative mining approach. We show that\nleveraging our new framework compared to traditional training leads to relative\nWER reductions of close to 10% in real-world dialog systems, and up to 26% on\npublic synthetic data.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10515v1) |\n| Constraints on axions from patchy screening of the cosmic microwave\n  background | Samuel Goldstein, Fiona McCarthy, Cristina Mondino, J.

Originally, weak superimposed codes\nwere introduced in the context of multimedia content protection against illegal\ndistribution of copies under the assumption that a coalition of malicious users\nmay employ the averaging attack with adversarial noise. As in many other kinds\nof codes in information theory, it is of interest and importance in the study\nof weak superimposed codes to find the highest achievable rate in the\nasymptotic regime and give an efficient construction that produces an infinite\nsequence of codes that achieve it. Here, we prove a tighter lower bound than\nthe sharpest known one on the rate of optimal weak superimposed codes and give\na polynomial-time randomized construction algorithm for codes that\nasymptotically attain our improved bound with high probability.

We propose an LLM-based translation\nscheme that improves the success rate of translating large-scale C code into\ncompilable Rust code. Our approach involves three key techniques: (1)\npre-processing the C code to better align its structure and expressions with\nRust, (2) segmenting the code into optimally sized translation units to avoid\nexceeding the LLM's context window limits, and (3) iteratively compiling and\nrepairing errors while maintaining consistency between translation units using\ncontext-supplementing prompts. Compilation success is an essential first step\nin achieving functional equivalence, as only compilable code can be further\ntested. In experiments with 20 benchmark C programs, including those exceeding\n4 kilo lines of code, we successfully translated all programs into compilable\nRust code without losing corresponding parts of the original code.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10506v1) |\n| Machine Learning Optimization of non-Kasha Behavior and of Transient\n  Dynamics in Model Retinal Isomerization | Davinder Singh, Chern Chuang, Paul Brumer |   Designing a model of retinal isomerization in Rhodopsin, the first step in\nvision, that accounts for both experimental transient and stationary state\nobservables is challenging. Here, multi-objective Bayesian optimization is\nemployed to refine the parameters of a minimal two-state-two-mode (TM) model\ndescribing the photoisomerization of retinal in Rhodopsin. With an appropriate\nselection of objectives, the optimized retinal model predicts excitation\nwavelength-dependent fluorescence spectra that closely align with\nexperimentally observed non-Kasha behavior in the non-equilibrium steady state.\nFurther, adjustments to the potential energy surface within the TM model reduce\nthe discrepancies across the time domain.

Existing works often rely\non local interpretability methods, failing to provide comprehensive\nexplanations of the overall mechanism behind each label prediction within a\nmultilabel set. We propose a mechanistic interpretability module called\nDIctionary Label Attention (\\method) that disentangles uninterpretable dense\nembeddings into a sparse embedding space, where each nonzero element (a\ndictionary feature) represents a globally learned medical concept. Through\nhuman evaluations, we show that our sparse embeddings are more human\nunderstandable than its dense counterparts by at least 50 percent. Our\nautomated dictionary feature identification pipeline, leveraging large language\nmodels (LLMs), uncovers thousands of learned medical concepts by examining and\nsummarizing the highest activating tokens for each dictionary feature. We\nrepresent the relationships between dictionary features and medical codes\nthrough a sparse interpretable matrix, enhancing the mechanistic and global\nunderstanding of the model's predictions while maintaining competitive\nperformance and scalability without extensive human annotation.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10504v1) |\n| Causal Language Modeling Can Elicit Search and Reasoning Capabilities on\n  Logic Puzzles | Kulin Shah, Nishanth Dikkala, Xin Wang, Rina Panigrahy |   Causal language modeling using the Transformer architecture has yielded\nremarkable capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) over the last few\nyears. However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning\ncapabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this\nwork, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as\nsolving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to\nsearch over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then\napply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the\napplication of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in\na cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases,\nmultiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We\nobserve that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn\nto solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21\\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly)\nwhen trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that\ntraining Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and\nwithout such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis\nto Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves\n$92.04 \\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal\nrepresentations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear\nprobing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any\ngiven cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine\nimplicit in the Transformer weights.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10502v1) |\n| Alignment with nonlinear velocity couplings: collision-avoidance and\n  micro-to-macro mean-field limits | Young-Pil Choi, Micha\u0142 Fabisiak, Jan Peszek |   We investigate the pressureless fractional Euler-alignment system with\nnonlinear velocity couplings, referred to as the $p$-Euler-alignment system.\nThis model features a nonlinear velocity alignment force, interpreted as a\ndensity-weighted fractional $p$-Laplacian when the singularity parameter\n$\\alpha$ exceeds the spatial dimension $d$. Our primary goal is to establish\nthe existence of solutions for strongly singular interactions ($\\alpha \\ge d$)\nand compactly supported initial conditions. We construct solutions as\nmean-field limits of empirical measures from a kinetic variant of the\n$p$-Euler-alignment system. Specifically, we show that a sequence of empirical\nmeasures converges to a finite Radon measure, whose local density and velocity\nsatisfy the $p$-Euler-alignment system. Our results are the first to prove the\nexistence of solutions to this system in multi-dimensional settings without\nsignificant initial data restrictions, covering both nonlinear ($p>2$) and\nlinear ($p=2$) cases. Additionally, we establish global existence, uniqueness,\nand collision avoidance for the corresponding particle ODE system under\nnon-collisional initial conditions, extending previous results for $1 \\le p \\le\n\\alpha + 2$. This analysis supports our mean-field limit argument and\ncontributes to understanding alignment models with singular communication.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10501v1) |\n| Focus diverse phase retrieval test results on broadband continuous\n  wavefront sensing in space telescope applications | Hyukmo Kang, Kyle Van Gorkom, Meghdoot Biswas, Daewook Kim, Ewan S. Douglas |   Continuous wavefront sensing benefits space observatories in on-orbit optical\nperformance maintenance. To measure the phase of a wavefront, phase retrieval\nis an attractive technique as it uses multiple point spread function (PSF)\nimages that are acquired by the telescope itself without extra metrology\nsystems nor complicated calibration. The focus diverse phase retrieval utilizes\nPSFs from predetermined defocused positions to enhance the dynamic range of the\nalgorithm. We describe an updated visible light active optics testbed with the\naddition of a linear motorized focus stage. The performance of the phase\nretrieval algorithm in broadband is tested under various cases. While broadband\npass filters have advantages in higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the\nperformance of phase retrieval can be restricted due to blurred image caused by\ndiffraction and increased computing cost. We used multiple bandpass filters (10\nnm, 88 nm, and 150 nm) and investigated effects of bandwidth on the accuracy\nand required image acquisition conditions such as SNR, reaching accuracies\nbelow 20 nm RMS wavefront error at the widest bandwidth. We also investigated\nthe dynamic range of the phase retrieval algorithm depending on the bandwidth\nand required amount of defocus to expand dynamic range. Finally, we simulated\nthe continuous wavefront sensing and correction loop with a range of\nstatistically generated representative telescope disturbance time series to\ntest for edge cases.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10500v1) |\n| The role of higher-order terms in trapped-ion quantum computing with\n  magnetic gradient induced coupling | Sebastian Nagies, Kevin T. Geier, Javed Akram, Junichi Okamoto, Dimitris Badounas, Christof Wunderlich, Michael Johanning, Philipp Hauke |   Trapped-ion hardware based on the Magnetic Gradient Induced Coupling (MAGIC)\nscheme is emerging as a promising platform for quantum computing. Nevertheless,\nin this (as in any other) quantum-computing platform, many technical questions\nstill have to be resolved before large-scale and error-tolerant applications\nare possible. In this work, we present a thorough discussion of the\ncontribution of higher-order terms to the MAGIC setup, which can occur due to\nanharmonicities in the external potential of the ion crystal (e.g., through\nCoulomb repulsion) or through curvature of the applied magnetic field. These\nterms take the form of three-spin couplings as well as diverse terms that\ncouple spins to phonons. We find that most of these are negligible in realistic\nsituations, with only two contributions that need careful attention. First,\nthere are parasitic longitudinal fields whose strength increases with chain\nlength, but which can easily be compensated by a microwave detuning. Second,\nanharmonicities of the Coulomb interaction can lead to well-known two-to-one\nconversions of phonon excitations, which can be avoided if the phonons are\nground-state cooled. Our detailed analysis constitutes an important\ncontribution on the way of making magnetic-gradient trapped-ion quantum\ntechnology fit for large-scale applications, and it may inspire new ways to\npurposefully design interaction terms.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10498v1) |\n| MusicLIME: Explainable Multimodal Music Understanding | Theodoros Sotirou, Vassilis Lyberatos, Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Stamou |   Multimodal models are critical for music understanding tasks, as they capture\nthe complex interplay between audio and lyrics. However, as these models become\nmore prevalent, the need for explainability grows-understanding how these\nsystems make decisions is vital for ensuring fairness, reducing bias, and\nfostering trust. In this paper, we introduce MusicLIME, a model-agnostic\nfeature importance explanation method designed for multimodal music models.\nUnlike traditional unimodal methods, which analyze each modality separately\nwithout considering the interaction between them, often leading to incomplete\nor misleading explanations, MusicLIME reveals how audio and lyrical features\ninteract and contribute to predictions, providing a holistic view of the\nmodel's decision-making. Additionally, we enhance local explanations by\naggregating them into global explanations, giving users a broader perspective\nof model behavior. Through this work, we contribute to improving the\ninterpretability of multimodal music models, empowering users to make informed\nchoices, and fostering more equitable, fair, and transparent music\nunderstanding systems.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10496v1) |\n| Incorporating Classifier-Free Guidance in Diffusion Model-Based\n  Recommendation | Noah Buchanan, Susan Gauch, Quan Mai |   This paper presents a diffusion-based recommender system that incorporates\nclassifier-free guidance. Most current recommender systems provide\nrecommendations using conventional methods such as collaborative or\ncontent-based filtering. Diffusion is a new approach to generative AI that\nimproves on previous generative AI approaches such as Variational Autoencoders\n(VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We incorporate diffusion in\na recommender system that mirrors the sequence users take when browsing and\nrating items. Although a few current recommender systems incorporate diffusion,\nthey do not incorporate classifier-free guidance, a new innovation in diffusion\nmodels as a whole. In this paper, we present a diffusion recommender system\nthat augments the underlying recommender system model for improved performance\nand also incorporates classifier-free guidance. Our findings show improvements\nover state-of-the-art recommender systems for most metrics for several\nrecommendation tasks on a variety of datasets.

We study the\nrenormalizability of this theory in the framework of the Batalin-Vilkovisky\nformalism, which allows for a gauge invariant renormalization. Using the\nbackground field method, we discuss the gauge invariance of the background\neffective action and analyze the Ward identities which reflect the symmetries\nof the EC theory.

This paper investigates the effectiveness of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) in identifying vulnerabilities within codebases, with a focus on\nthe latest advancements in LLM technology. Through a comparative analysis, we\nassess the performance of emerging LLMs, specifically Llama, CodeLlama, Gemma,\nand CodeGemma, alongside established state-of-the-art models such as BERT,\nRoBERTa, and GPT-3. Our study aims to shed light on the capabilities of LLMs in\nvulnerability detection, contributing to the enhancement of software security\npractices across diverse open-source repositories.

Our paper aims to investigate if VLMs\npre-trained on web-scale data learn to encode object states, which can be\nextracted with zero-shot text prompts. We curate an object state recognition\ndataset ChangeIt-Frames, and evaluate nine open-source VLMs, including models\ntrained with contrastive and generative objectives. We observe that while these\nstate-of-the-art vision-language models can reliably perform object\nrecognition, they consistently fail to accurately distinguish the objects'\nphysical states. Through extensive experiments, we identify three areas for\nimprovements for VLMs to better encode object states, namely the quality of\nobject localization, the architecture to bind concepts to objects, and the\nobjective to learn discriminative visual and language encoders on object\nstates.

Ruan, Michael Eracleous, Daryl Haggard, Jessie C. Runnoe |   The physical processes that produce X-ray Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs)\nrecently discovered from the nuclei of several low-redshift galaxies are\nmysterious. Several pieces of observational evidence strongly suggest a link\nbetween QPEs and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE). Previous studies also reveal\nthat the morphologies of TDE host galaxies are highly concentrated, with high\nSersic indicies, bulge-to-total light (B/T) ratios, and stellar surface mass\ndensities relative to the broader galaxy population. We use these distinctive\nproperties to test the link between QPEs and TDEs, by comparing these\nparameters of QPE host galaxies to TDE host galaxies. We employ archival Legacy\nSurvey images of a sample of 9 QPE host galaxies and a sample of 13 TDE host\ngalaxies, and model their surface brightness profiles. We show that QPE host\ngalaxies have high Sersic indices of ~3, high B/T ratios of ~0.5, and high\nsurface mass densities of ~10^10 Msun kpc^-2. These properties are similar to\nTDE host galaxies, but are in strong contrast to a mass- and redshift-matched\ncontrol sample of galaxies. We also find tentative evidence that the central\nblack holes in both QPE and TDE host galaxies are undermassive relative to\ntheir stellar mass. The morphological similarities between QPE and TDE host\ngalaxies at the population level add to the mounting evidence of a physical\nlink between these phenomena, and favor QPE models that also invoke TDEs.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10486v1) |\n| Tuning the Rate of Tightly Packed Systems To Produce Planet Occurrence\n  Trends with Galactic Height | Sarah Ballard |   The formation of planetary systems has historically been considered in\nisolation, decoupled from processes on galactic scales. Recent findings\nemploying data from ESA's Gaia mission challenge this narrative, identifying\ntrends in planet occurrence with galactic kinematics and stellar age. The\nfindings indicate changes in planet occurrence over and above the predicted\nchanges from metallicity variation within the Milky Way, so that changes to\nstellar metallicity alone (long understood to be deterministic in planet\noutcomes) cannot explain the trends entirely. The scope of potential factors\ninfluencing planet formation has grown progressively wider, with accompanying\ntheoretical support for galactic-scale influences upon planet formation. In\nthis manuscript, we investigate specifically how changes to the rate of Systems\nof Tightly-packed Inner Planets (STIPs) could manifest as a trend in planet\noccurrence with galactic height. We focus our study upon M dwarf planetary\nsystems for two reasons: first, they host STIPs at high rates, and secondly,\ntheir longevity makes them useful probes for kinematic trends over Gyr. We\nconsider two models for a varying STIP rate: one in which STIP likelihood is\ndetermined by stellar age alone, irrespective of galactic time, and another in\nwhich the STIP likelihood suddenly increased in recent galactic history. Both\nmodels, which impose a higher STIP likelihood among younger stars, produce a\nnegative gradient in planet occurrence with increasing height from the galactic\nmidplane. We find that a step function model in which STIP likelihood increased\nby a factor of several ~a few Gyr ago resembles an observed trend among FGK\ndwarfs. We consider plausible physical mechanisms that could mimic the\nhypothesized model, given known links between STIP occurrence and other stellar\nand planetary properties.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10485v1) |\n| XLM for Autonomous Driving Systems: A Comprehensive Review | Sonda Fourati, Wael Jaafar, Noura Baccar, Safwan Alfattani |   Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable proficiency in various\ninformation-processing tasks. These tasks span from extracting data and\nsummarizing literature to generating content, predictive modeling,\ndecision-making, and system controls. Moreover, Vision Large Models (VLMs) and\nMultimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which represent the next generation of language\nmodels, a.k.a., XLMs, can combine and integrate many data modalities with the\nstrength of language understanding, thus advancing several information-based\nsystems, such as Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). Indeed, by combining\nlanguage communication with multimodal sensory inputs, e.g., panoramic images\nand LiDAR or radar data, accurate driving actions can be taken. In this\ncontext, we provide in this survey paper a comprehensive overview of the\npotential of XLMs towards achieving autonomous driving. Specifically, we review\nthe relevant literature on ADS and XLMs, including their architectures, tools,\nand frameworks. Then, we detail the proposed approaches to deploy XLMs for\nautonomous driving solutions. Finally, we provide the related challenges to XLM\ndeployment for ADS and point to future research directions aiming to enable XLM\nadoption in future ADS frameworks.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10484v1) |\n| Efficient polarizable QM/MM using the direct reaction field Hamiltonian\n  with electrostatic potential fitted multipole operators | Thomas P. Fay, Nicolas Ferr\u00e9, Miquel Huix-Rotllant |   Electronic polarization and dispersion are decisive actors in determining\ninteraction energies between molecules. These interactions have a particularly\nprofound effect on excitation energies of molecules in complex environments,\nespecially when the excitation involves a significant degree of charge\nreorganisation. The direct reaction field (DRF) approach, which has seen a\nrecent revival of interest, provides a powerful framework for describing these\ninteractions in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models of\nsystems, where a small subsystem of interest is described using quantum\nchemical methods and the remainder is treated with a simple MM force field. In\nthis paper we show how the DRF approach can be combined with the electrostatic\npotential fitted (ESPF) multipole operator description of the QM region charge\ndensity, which reduces the scaling $\\mathcal{O}(N_\\mathrm{MM}^3)$ of the method\nwith MM system to $\\mathcal{O}(N_\\mathrm{MM}^2)$. We also show how the DRF\napproach can be combined with fluctuating charge descriptions of the\npolarizable environment, as well as previously used atom-centred\ndipole-polarizability based models. We further show that the ESPF-DRF method\nprovides an accurate description of molecular interactions in both ground and\nexcited electronic states of the QM system and apply it to predict the gas to\naqueous solution solvatochromic shifts in the UV/visible absorption spectrum of\nacrolein.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10483v1) |\n| Schrodinger's Memory: Large Language Models | Wei Wang, Qing Li |   Memory is the foundation of LLMs' functionality, yet past research has lacked\nan in-depth exploration of their memory capabilities and underlying theory.

These assumptions limit their use\nwhen acquisition conditions, such as the subject's distance from the camera or\nthe camera's characteristics, are different than expected, as typically happens\nin video surveillance. Additionally, 3DFR algorithms follow various strategies\nto address the reconstruction of a 3D shape from 2D data, such as statistical\nmodel fitting, photometric stereo, or deep learning. In the present study, we\nexplore the application of three 3DFR algorithms representative of the SOTA,\nemploying each one as the template set generator for a face verification\nsystem. The scores provided by each system are combined by score-level fusion.\nWe show that the complementarity induced by different 3DFR algorithms improves\nperformance when tests are conducted at never-seen-before distances from the\ncamera and camera characteristics (cross-distance and cross-camera settings),\nthus encouraging further investigations on multiple 3DFR-based approaches.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10481v1) |\n| Addressing misspecification in contextual optimization | Omar Bennouna, Jiawei Zhang, Saurabh Amin, Asuman Ozdaglar |   We study a linear contextual optimization problem where a decision maker has\naccess to historical data and contextual features to learn a cost prediction\nmodel aimed at minimizing decision error. We adopt the predict-then-optimize\nframework for this analysis. Given that perfect model alignment with reality is\noften unrealistic in practice, we focus on scenarios where the chosen\nhypothesis set is misspecified. In this context, it remains unclear whether\ncurrent contextual optimization approaches can effectively address such model\nmisspecification. In this paper, we present a novel integrated learning and\noptimization approach designed to tackle model misspecification in contextual\noptimization. This approach offers theoretical generalizability, tractability,\nand optimality guarantees, along with strong practical performance. Our method\ninvolves minimizing a tractable surrogate loss that aligns with the performance\nvalue from cost vector predictions, regardless of whether the model\nmisspecified or not, and can be optimized in reasonable time.

One of the classical and popular approaches is Local\nStochastic Gradient Descent (Local SGD), characterized by multiple local\nupdates before averaging, which is particularly useful in distributed\nenvironments to reduce communication bottlenecks and improve scalability. A\ntypical feature of this method is the dependence on the frequency of\ncommunications. But in the case of a quadratic target function with homogeneous\ndata distribution over all devices, the influence of frequency of\ncommunications vanishes. As a natural consequence, subsequent studies include\nthe assumption of a Lipschitz Hessian, as this indicates the similarity of the\noptimized function to a quadratic one to some extent. However, in order to\nextend the completeness of the Local SGD theory and unlock its potential, in\nthis paper we abandon the Lipschitz Hessian assumption by introducing a new\nconcept of $\\textit{approximate quadraticity}$. This assumption gives a new\nperspective on problems that have near quadratic properties. In addition,\nexisting theoretical analyses of Local SGD often assume bounded variance. We,\nin turn, consider the unbounded noise condition, which allows us to broaden the\nclass of studied problems.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10478v1) |\n| SimInversion: A Simple Framework for Inversion-Based Text-to-Image\n  Editing | Qi Qian, Haiyang Xu, Ming Yan, Juhua Hu |   Diffusion models demonstrate impressive image generation performance with\ntext guidance. Inspired by the learning process of diffusion, existing images\ncan be edited according to text by DDIM inversion. However, the vanilla DDIM\ninversion is not optimized for classifier-free guidance and the accumulated\nerror will result in the undesired performance. While many algorithms are\ndeveloped to improve the framework of DDIM inversion for editing, in this work,\nwe investigate the approximation error in DDIM inversion and propose to\ndisentangle the guidance scale for the source and target branches to reduce the\nerror while keeping the original framework. Moreover, a better guidance scale\n(i.e., 0.5) than default settings can be derived theoretically.

However, previous works either rely on contrastive learning that\nsuffers false negative problems or are based on reconstruction that learns too\nmuch unessential low-level clues, leading to limited representations for\ndownstream tasks. Recently, great advances have been made in generative\nlearning, which is naturally a challenging yet meaningful pretext task to model\nthe general underlying data distributions. However, the representation learning\ncapacity of generative models is under-explored, especially for the skeletons\nwith spacial sparsity and temporal redundancy. To this end, we propose Masked\nConditional Diffusion (MacDiff) as a unified framework for human skeleton\nmodeling. For the first time, we leverage diffusion models as effective\nskeleton representation learners. Specifically, we train a diffusion decoder\nconditioned on the representations extracted by a semantic encoder. Random\nmasking is applied to encoder inputs to introduce a information bottleneck and\nremove redundancy of skeletons. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that\nour generative objective involves the contrastive learning objective which\naligns the masked and noisy views. Meanwhile, it also enforces the\nrepresentation to complement for the noisy view, leading to better\ngeneralization performance. MacDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nrepresentation learning benchmarks while maintaining the competence for\ngenerative tasks. Moreover, we leverage the diffusion model for data\naugmentation, significantly enhancing the fine-tuning performance in scenarios\nwith scarce labeled data.

Hassan |   The proliferation of open Pre-trained Language Models (PTLMs) on model\nregistry platforms like Hugging Face (HF) presents both opportunities and\nchallenges for companies building products around them. Similar to traditional\nsoftware dependencies, PTLMs continue to evolve after a release. However, the\ncurrent state of release practices of PTLMs on model registry platforms are\nplagued by a variety of inconsistencies, such as ambiguous naming conventions\nand inaccessible model training documentation. Given the knowledge gap on\ncurrent PTLM release practices, our empirical study uses a mixed-methods\napproach to analyze the releases of 52,227 PTLMs on the most well-known model\nregistry, HF. Our results reveal 148 different naming practices for PTLM\nreleases, with 40.87% of changes to model weight files not represented in the\nadopted name-based versioning practice or their documentation. In addition, we\nidentified that the 52,227 PTLMs are derived from only 299 different base\nmodels (the modified original models used to create 52,227 PTLMs), with\nFine-tuning and Quantization being the most prevalent modification methods\napplied to these base models. Significant gaps in release transparency, in\nterms of training dataset specifications and model card availability, still\nexist, highlighting the need for standardized documentation. While we\nidentified a model naming practice explicitly differentiating between major and\nminor PTLM releases, we did not find any significant difference in the types of\nchanges that went into either type of releases, suggesting that major/minor\nversion numbers for PTLMs often are chosen arbitrarily. Our findings provide\nvaluable insights to improve PTLM release practices, nudging the field towards\nmore formal semantic versioning practices.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10472v1) |\n| Real-Time Whole-Body Control of Legged Robots with Model-Predictive Path\n  Integral Control | Juan Alvarez-Padilla, John Z.

F. Lizarraga, Flavia M. D. Marquitti, Marcus A. M. de Aguiar |   We investigate the role of assortative mating in speciation using the\nsympatric model of Derrida and Higgs. The model explores the idea that genetic\ndifferences create incompatibilities between individuals, preventing mating if\nthe number of such differences is too large. Speciation, however, only happens\nin this mating system if the number of genes is large. Here we show that\nspeciation with small genome sizes can occur if assortative mating is\nintroduced. In our model individuals are represented by three chromosomes: one\nresponsible for reproductive compatibility, one for coding the trait on which\nassortativity will operate, and a neutral chromosome. Reproduction is possible\nif individuals are genetically similar with respect to the first chromosome,\nbut among these compatible mating partners, the one with the most similar trait\ncoded by the second chromosome is selected. We show that this type of\nassortativity facilitates speciation, which can happen with a small number of\ngenes in the first chromosome. Species, classified according to reproductive\nisolation, dictated by the first chromosome, can display different traits\nvalues, as measured by the second and the third chromosomes. Therefore, species\ncan also be identified based on similarity of the neutral trait, which works as\na proxy for reproductive isolation.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10466v1) |\n| A stabilized total pressure-formulation of the Biot's poroelasticity\n  equations in frequency domain: numerical analysis and applications | Cristian C\u00e1rcamo, Alfonso Caiazzo, Felipe Galarce, Joaqu\u00edn Mura |   This work focuses on the numerical solution of the dynamics of a poroelastic\nmaterial in the frequency domain.

Utilizing the\nFredholm alternative, we extend the well-posedness results to the discrete\nsetting, obtaining theoretical optimal convergence for the case of linear\nfinite elements. We present different numerical experiments to validate the\nproposed method. First, we consider model problems with known analytic\nsolutions in two and three dimensions. As next, we show that the method is\nrobust for a wide range of permeabilities, including the case of discontinuous\ncoefficients. Lastly, we show the application for the simulation of brain\nelastography on a realistic brain geometry obtained from medical imaging.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10465v1) |\n| New Direct Sum Tests | Alek Westover, Edward Yu, Kai Zheng |   A function $f:[n]^{d} \\to \\mathbb{F}_2$ is a \\defn{direct sum} if there are\nfunctions $L_i:[n]\\to \\mathbb{F}_2$ such that ${f(x) = \\sum_{i}L_i(x_i)}$. In\nthis work we give multiple results related to the property testing of direct\nsums.\n  Our first result concerns a test proposed by Dinur and Golubev in 2019. We\ncall their test the Diamond test and show that it is indeed a direct sum\ntester. More specifically, we show that if a function $f$ is $\\epsilon$-far\nfrom being a direct sum function, then the Diamond test rejects $f$ with\nprobability at least $\\Omega_{n,\\epsilon}(1)$. Even in the case of $n = 2$, the\nDiamond test is, to the best of our knowledge, novel and yields a new tester\nfor the classic property of affinity.\n  Apart from the Diamond test, we also analyze a broad family of direct sum\ntests, which at a high level, run an arbitrary affinity test on the restriction\nof $f$ to a random hypercube inside of $[n]^d$. This family of tests includes\nthe direct sum test analyzed in \\cite{di19}, but does not include the Diamond\ntest. As an application of our result, we obtain a direct sum test which works\nin the online adversary model of \\cite{KRV}.\n  Finally, we also discuss a Fourier analytic interpretation of the diamond\ntester in the $n=2$ case, as well as prove local correction results for direct\nsum as conjectured by Dinur and Golubev.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10464v1) |\n| Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks in Low-Data Regimes: A Comparative Study with\n  Multilayer Perceptrons | Farhad Pourkamali-Anaraki |   Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) have long been a cornerstone in deep learning,\nknown for their capacity to model complex relationships. Recently,\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a compelling alternative,\nutilizing highly flexible learnable activation functions directly on network\nedges, a departure from the neuron-centric approach of MLPs. However, KANs\nsignificantly increase the number of learnable parameters, raising concerns\nabout their effectiveness in data-scarce environments. This paper presents a\ncomprehensive comparative study of MLPs and KANs from both algorithmic and\nexperimental perspectives, with a focus on low-data regimes. We introduce an\neffective technique for designing MLPs with unique, parameterized activation\nfunctions for each neuron, enabling a more balanced comparison with KANs. Using\nempirical evaluations on simulated data and two real-world data sets from\nmedicine and engineering, we explore the trade-offs between model complexity\nand accuracy, with particular attention to the role of network depth. Our\nfindings show that MLPs with individualized activation functions achieve\nsignificantly higher predictive accuracy with only a modest increase in\nparameters, especially when the sample size is limited to around one hundred.\nFor example, in a three-class classification problem within additive\nmanufacturing, MLPs achieve a median accuracy of 0.91, significantly\noutperforming KANs, which only reach a median accuracy of 0.53 with default\nhyperparameters. These results offer valuable insights into the impact of\nactivation function selection in neural networks.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10463v1) |\n| Effects of synapse location, delay and background stochastic activity on\n  synchronising hippocampal CA1 neurons | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore |   We study the synchronisation of neurons in a realistic model under the\nHodgkin-Huxley dynamics. To focus on the role of the different locations of the\nexcitatory synapses, we use two identical neurons where the set of input\nsignals is grouped at two different distances from the soma. The system is\nintended to represent a CA1 hippocampal neuron in which the synapses arriving\nfrom the CA3 neurons of the trisynaptic pathway appear to be localised in the\napical dendritic region and are, in principle, either proximal or distal to the\nsoma. Synchronisation is studied using a specifically defined spiking\ncorrelation function as a function of various parameters such as the distance\nfrom the soma of one of the synaptic groups, the inhibition weight and the\nassociated activation delay. We found that the neurons' spiking activity\ndepends nonmonotonically on the relative dendritic location of the synapses and\ntheir inhibitory weight, whereas the synchronisation measure always decreases\nwith inhibition, and strongly depends on its activation time delay. The\nbackground activity on the somas results essentially independent on the\nfluctuation intensity and strongly support the importance of the balance\nbetween inhibition and excitation for neuronal synchronization.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10460v1) |\n| Efficiently Crowdsourcing Visual Importance with Punch-Hole Annotation | Minsuk Chang, Soohyun Lee, Aeri Cho, Hyeon Jeon, Seokhyeon Park, Cindy Xiong Bearfield, Jinwook Seo |   We introduce a novel crowdsourcing method for identifying important areas in\ngraphical images through punch-hole labeling. Traditional methods, such as gaze\ntrackers and mouse-based annotations, which generate continuous data, can be\nimpractical in crowdsourcing scenarios. They require many participants, and the\noutcome data can be noisy. In contrast, our method first segments the graphical\nimage with a grid and drops a portion of the patches (punch holes). Then, we\niteratively ask the labeler to validate each annotation with holes, narrowing\ndown the annotation only having the most important area. This approach aims to\nreduce annotation noise in crowdsourcing by standardizing the annotations while\nenhancing labeling efficiency and reliability. Preliminary findings from\nfundamental charts demonstrate that punch-hole labeling can effectively\npinpoint critical regions. This also highlights its potential for broader\napplication in visualization research, particularly in studying large-scale\nusers' graphical perception. Our future work aims to enhance the algorithm to\nachieve faster labeling speed and prove its utility through large-scale\nexperiments.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10459v1) |\n| Full distribution of local observables in an exactly solvable current\n  carrying steady states of a driven XXZ chain | Sandipan Manna, G J Sreejith |   Current carrying steady states of interacting spins chains exhibit rich\nstructures generated through an interplay of current induced correlations and\nenergetic constraints from the Hamiltonian. The XXZ spin chain when coupled to\nmaximally polarizing Lindblad terms admits an exact solution in a matrix\nproduct state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations\nand distributions of simple local spin observables in the non equilibrium\nsteady state (NESS). We present exact expressions for spin correlators, entropy\nper site, cumulant generating functions for distributions of local observables\nin the XX limit (Ising anisotropy $\\Delta=0$). Further, we use the exact MPS\nsolution in systems with $\\Delta>0$, to numerically exactly calculate the\nentropy, correlations, as well as distributions of spin observables in blocks\nas large as $n\\sim 200$ sites allowing an estimation of the rate functions. The\n$z$ magnetization distribution is consistant with short range spin correlations\nin the $z$ direction while the $x$-magnetization shows a double peak structure\nat larger $\\Delta$ suggesting short range ferromagnetic ordering. We find that\nthe distribution of $z$-magnetization sharpens for parameters where the current\nis maximized.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10458v1) |\n| Mean Residual Life Ageing Intensity Function | Ashutosh Singh, Ishapathik Das, Asok Kumar Nanda, Sumen Sen |   The ageing intensity function is a powerful analytical tool that provides\nvaluable insights into the ageing process across diverse domains such as\nreliability engineering, actuarial science, and healthcare. Its applications\ncontinue to expand as researchers delve deeper into understanding the complex\ndynamics of ageing and its implications for society. One common approach to\ndefining the ageing intensity function is through the hazard rate or failure\nrate function, extensively explored in scholarly literature. Equally\nsignificant to the hazard rate function is the mean residual life function,\nwhich plays a crucial role in analyzing the ageing patterns exhibited by units\nor components. This article introduces the mean residual life ageing intensity\n(MRLAI) function to delve into component ageing behaviours across various\ndistributions. Additionally, we scrutinize the closure properties of the MRLAI\nfunction across different reliability operations. Furthermore, a new order\ntermed the mean residual life ageing intensity order is defined to analyze the\nageing behaviour of a system, and the closure property of this order under\nvarious reliability operations is discussed.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10456v1) |\n| Quantile Fourier regressions for decision making under uncertainty | Arash Khojaste, Geoffrey Pritchard, Golbon Zakeri |   Weconsider Markov decision processes arising from a Markov model of an\nunderlying natural phenomenon. Such phenomena are usually periodic (e.g.\nannual) in time, and so the Markov processes modelling them must be\ntime-inhomogeneous, with cyclostationary rather than stationary behaviour. We\ndescribe a technique for constructing such processes that allows for periodic\nvariations both in the values taken by the process and in the serial dependence\nstructure. We include two illustrative numerical examples: a hydropower\nscheduling problem and a model of offshore wind power integration.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10455v1) |\n| The Debiased Near-Earth Object Population from ATLAS Telescopes | Rogerio Deienno, Larry Denneau, David Nesvorn\u00fd, David Vokrouhlick\u00fd, William F. Bottke, Robert Jedicke, Shantanu Naidu, Steven R. Chesley, Davide Farnocchia, Paul W. Chodas |   This work is dedicated to debias the Near-Earth Objects (NEO) population\nbased on observations from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System\n(ATLAS) telescopes. We have applied similar methods used to develop the\nrecently released NEO model generator (NEOMOD), once debiasing the NEO\npopulation using data from Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) G96 telescope. ATLAS is\ncomposed of four different telescopes. We first analyzed observational data\nfrom each of all four telescopes separately and later combined them. Our\nresults highlight main differences between CSS and ATLAS, e.g., sky coverage\nand survey power at debiasing the NEO population. ATLAS has a much larger sky\ncoverage than CSS, allowing it to find bright NEOs that would be constantly\n\"hiding\" from CSS. Consequently, ATLAS is more powerful than CSS at debiasing\nthe NEO population for H $\\lesssim$ 19. With its intrinsically greater\nsensitivity and emphasis on observing near opposition, CSS excels in the\ndebiasing of smaller objects. ATLAS, as an all sky survey designed to find\nimminent hazardous objects, necessarily spends a significant fraction of time\nlooking at places on the sky where objects do not appear, reducing its power\nfor debiasing the population of small objects. We estimate a NEO population\ncompleteness of $\\approx$ 88%$^{+3\\%}_{-2\\%}$ for H $<$ 17.75 and $\\approx$\n36%$^{+1\\%}_{-1\\%}$ for H $<$ 22.25. Those numbers are similar to previous\nestimates (within error bars for H $<$ 17.75) from CSS, yet, around 3% and 8%\nsmaller at their face values, respectively. We also confirm previous finding\nthat the $\\nu_6$ secular resonance is the main source of small and faint NEOs\nat H = 28, whereas the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter dominates for\nlarger and brighter NEOs at H = 15.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10453v1) |\n| Signed Graph Autoencoder for Explainable and Polarization-Aware Network\n  Embeddings | Nikolaos Nakis, Chrysoula Kosma, Giannis Nikolentzos, Michalis Chatzianastasis, Iakovos Evdaimon, Michalis Vazirgiannis |   Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant\nattention in recent years for their ability to extract informative latent\nrepresentations, characterizing the structure of complex topologies, such as\ngraphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited\nfocus on developing and evaluating explainable neural-based graph generative\nmodels specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we\npropose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE\nextracts node-level representations that express node memberships over distinct\nextreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is\nachieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its\npolarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for\nanalyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with\nrelational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation\ndemonstrates the SGAAEs' capability to successfully infer node memberships over\nthe different underlying latent structures while extracting competing\ncommunities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the\nnetwork. Additionally, we introduce the 2-level network polarization problem\nand show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model\nachieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across\nfour real-world datasets, outperforming several baseline models.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10452v1) |\n| Why you should also use OLS estimation of tail exponents | Thiago Trafane Oliveira Santos, Daniel Oliveira Cajueiro |   Even though practitioners often estimate Pareto exponents running OLS\nrank-size regressions, the usual recommendation is to use the Hill MLE with a\nsmall-sample correction instead, due to its unbiasedness and efficiency. In\nthis paper, we advocate that you should also apply OLS in empirical\napplications. On the one hand, we demonstrate that, with a small-sample\ncorrection, the OLS estimator is also unbiased. On the other hand, we show that\nthe MLE assigns significantly greater weight to smaller observations. This\nsuggests that the OLS estimator may outperform the MLE in cases where the\ndistribution is (i) strictly Pareto but only in the upper tail or (ii)\nregularly varying rather than strictly Pareto. We substantiate our theoretical\nfindings with Monte Carlo simulations and real-world applications,\ndemonstrating the practical relevance of the OLS method in estimating tail\nexponents.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10448v1) |\n| Hydrodynamic hovering of swimming bacteria above surfaces | Pyae Hein Htet, Debasish Das, Eric Lauga |   Flagellated bacteria are hydrodynamically attracted to rigid walls, yet past\nwork shows a 'hovering' state where they swim stably at a finite height above\nsurfaces. We use numerics and theory to reveal the physical origin of hovering.\nSimulations first show that hovering requires an elongated cell body and\nresults from a tilt away from the wall. Theoretical models then identify two\nessential asymmetries: the response of width-asymmetric cells to active flows\ncreated by length-asymmetric cells.

To address this\nchallenge, we present KoroT-3E, an AI-based system that creates personalized\nmusical mnemonics to enhance both memory retention and understanding of\nconcepts in CS. KoroT-3E enables users to transform complex concepts into\nmemorable lyrics and compose melodies that suit their musical preferences. We\nconducted semi-structured interviews (n=12) to investigate why novice learners\nfind it challenging to memorize and understand CS concepts. The findings,\ncombined with constructivist learning theory, established our initial design,\nwhich was then refined following consultations with CS education experts. An\nempirical experiment(n=36) showed that those using KoroT-3E (n=18)\nsignificantly outperformed the control group (n=18), with improved memory\nefficiency, increased motivation, and a positive learning experience.

It is\na challenging problem due to the intricate characteristics of insects. In this\npaper, we present DeWi, novel learning assistance for insect pest\nclassification. With a one-stage and alternating training strategy, DeWi\nsimultaneously improves several Convolutional Neural Networks in two\nperspectives: discrimination (by optimizing a triplet margin loss in a\nsupervised training manner) and generalization (via data augmentation). From\nthat, DeWi can learn discriminative and in-depth features of insect pests\n(deep) yet still generalize well to a large number of insect categories (wide).\nExperimental results show that DeWi achieves the highest performances on two\ninsect pest classification benchmarks (76.44\\% accuracy on the IP102 dataset\nand 99.79\\% accuracy on the D0 dataset, respectively).

Behavior trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robot\ntask planning for their modularity and flexibility, but manually designing them\ncan be effort-intensive. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been\napplied in robotic task planning for generating action sequences, but their\nability to generate BTs has not been fully investigated. To this end, We\npropose LLM as BT-planner, a novel framework to leverage LLMs for BT generation\nin robotic assembly task planning and execution. Four in-context learning\nmethods are introduced to utilize the natural language processing and inference\ncapabilities of LLMs to produce task plans in BT format, reducing manual effort\nand ensuring robustness and comprehensibility. We also evaluate the performance\nof fine-tuned, fewer-parameter LLMs on the same tasks.

Aguilar, Ralph Bohlin, Misty Cracraft, Marjorie Decleir, Andras Gaspar, David R. Law, Alberto Noriega-Crespo, Michael Regan |   The absolute flux calibration of the Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and\nCoronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first\n2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the\nflux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays,\nand different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining\nobserved aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions\nbased on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of\nthese observations were combined with model point-spread-functions to measure\nthe corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with\ntime, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time,\nrate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations\nwere with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately\nevery month revealed a modest time-dependent response loss seen mainly at the\nlongest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential\nwith a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the\nband-dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was\nfound to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different\nsubarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting\nfor the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors\nmeasured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The\nformal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are\n0.3 to 1.0%, with longer-wavelength bands generally having larger\nuncertainties.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10443v1) |\n| CtRNet-X: Camera-to-Robot Pose Estimation in Real-world Conditions Using\n  a Single Camera | Jingpei Lu, Zekai Liang, Tristin Xie, Florian Ritcher, Shan Lin, Sainan Liu, Michael C. Yip |   Camera-to-robot calibration is crucial for vision-based robot control and\nrequires effort to make it accurate. Recent advancements in markerless pose\nestimation methods have eliminated the need for time-consuming physical setups\nfor camera-to-robot calibration. While the existing markerless pose estimation\nmethods have demonstrated impressive accuracy without the need for cumbersome\nsetups, they rely on the assumption that all the robot joints are visible\nwithin the camera's field of view. However, in practice, robots usually move in\nand out of view, and some portion of the robot may stay out-of-frame during the\nwhole manipulation task due to real-world constraints, leading to a lack of\nsufficient visual features and subsequent failure of these approaches. To\naddress this challenge and enhance the applicability to vision-based robot\ncontrol, we propose a novel framework capable of estimating the robot pose with\npartially visible robot manipulators. Our approach leverages the\nVision-Language Models for fine-grained robot components detection, and\nintegrates it into a keypoint-based pose estimation network, which enables more\nrobust performance in varied operational conditions. The framework is evaluated\non both public robot datasets and self-collected partial-view datasets to\ndemonstrate our robustness and generalizability. As a result, this method is\neffective for robot pose estimation in a wider range of real-world manipulation\nscenarios.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10441v1) |\n| Successive topological phase transitions in two distinct spin-flop\n  phases on the honeycomb lattice | Xudong Li, Jize Zhao, Jinbin Li, Qiang Luo |   The Kitaev magnets with bond-dependent interactions have garnered\nconsiderable attention in recent years for their ability to harbor exotic\nphases and nontrivial excitations. The topological magnons, which are indicated\nby nonzero Chern number and thermal Hall conductivity, are proposed to\npartially explain thermal Hall measurements in real materials. Hitherto,\ntopological magnons have been extensively explored when the magnetic field is\nnormal to the honeycomb plane, but their topological characteristics are less\nstudied in the presence of in-plane magnetic field. Here, we study two distinct\nin-plane field induced spin-flop phases in the $\\Gamma$-$\\Gamma'$ model, both\nof which are off-diagonal couplings that have intimate relation to the Kitaev\ninteraction. The two spin-flop phases are distinguished by their out-of-plane\nspin components which can be either antiparallel or parallel, thus dubbing\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) spin-flop phases, respectively.\nWe map out topological phase diagrams for both phases, revealing a rich pattern\nof the Chern number over exchange parameters and magnetic field. We\nanalytically calculate the boundaries of topological phase transitions when the\nmagnetic field is along the $a$ and $b$ directions. We find that the thermal\nHall conductivity and its derivative display contrasting behaviors when\ncrossing different topological phase transitions. The striking difference of\nthe two phases lies in that when the magnetic field is along the $b$ direction,\ntopological magnons are totally absent in the AFM spin-flop phase, while they\ncan survive in the FM analogue in certain parameter regions.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10439v1) |\n| A functorial approach to $n$-abelian categories | Vitor Gulisz |   We develop a functorial approach to the study of $n$-abelian categories by\nreformulating their axioms in terms of their categories of finitely presented\nfunctors.

The vast majority of\nenergy-preserving reduced-order methods use symplectic Galerkin projection to\nconstruct reduced-order Hamiltonian models by projecting the full models onto a\nsymplectic subspace. However, symplectic projection requires the existence of\nfully discrete operators, and in many cases, such as black-box PDE solvers,\nthese operators are inaccessible. In this work, we propose an energy-preserving\nmachine learning method that can infer the dynamics of the given PDE using data\nonly, so that the proposed framework does not depend on the fully discrete\noperators. In this context, the proposed method is non-intrusive. The proposed\nmethod is grey box in the sense that it requires only some basic knowledge of\nthe multi-symplectic model at the partial differential equation level. We prove\nthat the proposed method satisfies spatially discrete local energy conservation\nand preserves the multi-symplectic conservation laws. We test our method on the\nlinear wave equation, the Korteweg-de Vries equation, and the\nZakharov-Kuznetsov equation.

The\nsynchronization is investigated through a specifically defined spiking\ncorrelation function, and its behavior is analyzed as a function of several\nparameters: inhibition weight, distance from the soma of one synaptic group,\nexcitatory inactivation delay, and weight of the excitatory synapses.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10431v1) |\n| Meta-Whisper: Speech-Based Meta-ICL for ASR on Low-Resource Languages | Ming-Hao Hsu, Kuan Po Huang, Hung-yi Lee |   This paper presents Meta-Whisper, a novel approach to improve automatic\nspeech recognition (ASR) for low-resource languages using the Whisper model. By\nleveraging Meta In-Context Learning (Meta-ICL) and a k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\nalgorithm for sample selection, Meta-Whisper enhances Whisper's ability to\nrecognize speech in unfamiliar languages without extensive fine-tuning.\nExperiments on the ML-SUPERB dataset show that Meta-Whisper significantly\nreduces the Character Error Rate (CER) for low-resource languages compared to\nthe original Whisper model.

Rao |   Device-Independent Quantum Secure Direct Communication (DI-QSDC) enhances\nquantum cryptography by enabling secure message transmission without relying on\nthe trustworthiness of the devices involved. This approach mitigates risks\nassociated with compromised or untrusted devices, common in traditional quantum\ncommunication.\n  In this paper, we propose the first of its kind DI-QSDC protocol with user\nidentity authentication. This ensures the authenticity of both the sender and\nreceiver prior to message exchange. We then discuss the security of the\nproposed protocol against common attacks, demonstrating that no eavesdropper\ngains any information from either the quantum or the classical channel. Next,\nwe implement the protocol on IBM's quantum hardware and evaluate its\nperformance in a realistic noisy environment. Additionally, by simulating\ncommon attack models, we showcase that the protocol is secure against any\neavesdropper in the channel. These findings highlight the protocol's robust\nsecurity and practical feasibility for real-world secure quantum communication.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10427v1) |\n| Role of kinematic constraints in the time reversal symmetry breaking of\n  a model active matter | Soumen Das, Shankar Ghosh, Tridib Sadhu, Juliane U Klamser |   Active-matter systems are inherently out-of-equilibrium and perform\nmechanical work by utilizing their internal energy sources. Breakdown of\ntime-reversal symmetry (BTRS) is a hallmark of such dissipative non-equilibrium\ndynamics. We introduce a robust, experimentally accessible, noninvasive,\nquantitative measure of BTRS in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in\ncollision events, demonstrated in our novel artificial active matter, comprised\nof battery-powered spherical rolling robots whose energetics in different modes\nof motion can be measured with high precision. Our dimensionless measure\ncharacterizes how dissipation and internal energetics are influenced by\nkinematic constraints from interactions with the environment. We propose this\nmeasure of BTRS as an empirical estimate of the distance from equilibrium. An\nenergetic insight into this departure of active matter from equilibrium comes\nfrom our demonstration of a non-trivial fluctuation symmetry, which reveals a\npotentially universal thermodynamic characteristic of active energetics. As a\nmany-body consequence of BTRS in our experimental active system, we demonstrate\nthe emergence of activity-induced herding, which has no equilibrium analogue.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10425v1) |\n| Unveiling V Modes: Enhancing CMB Sensitivity to BSM Physics with a\n  Non-Ideal Half-Wave Plate | N. Raffuzzi, M. Lembo, S. Giardiello, M. Gerbino, M. Lattanzi, P. Natoli, L. Pagano |   V-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background is expected to be\nvanishingly small in the $\\Lambda$CDM model and, hence, usually ignored.\nNonetheless, several astrophysical effects, as well as beyond standard model\nphysics could produce it at a detectable level. A realistic half-wave plate -\nan optical element commonly used in CMB experiments to modulate the polarized\nsignal - can provide sensitivity to V modes without significantly spoiling that\nto linear polarization. We assess this sensitivity for some new-generation CMB\nexperiments, such as the LiteBIRD satellite, the ground-based Simons\nObservatory and a CMB-S4-like experiment. We forecast the efficiency of these\nexperiments to constrain the phenomenology of certain classes of BSM models\ninducing mixing of linear polarization states and generation of V modes in the\nCMB. We find that new-generation experiments can improve current limits by\n1-to-3 orders of magnitude, depending on the data combination. The inclusion of\nV-mode information dramatically boosts the sensitivity to these BSM models.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10424v1) |\n| Initial data for a deformed isolated horizon | Ale\u0161 Flandera, David Kofro\u0148, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Ledvinka |   Within the isolated horizon formalism, we investigate a static axisymmetric\nspace-time of a black hole influenced by matter in its neighborhood. To\nillustrate the role of ingredients and assumptions in this formalism, we first\nshow how, in spherical symmetry, the field equations and gauge conditions imply\nthe isolated horizon initial data leading to the Schwarzschild space-time.\nThen, we construct the initial data for a static axisymmetric isolated horizon\nrepresenting a deformed black hole. The space-time description in the\nBondi-like coordinates is then found as a series expansion in the vicinity of\nthe horizon. To graphically illustrate this construction, we also find a\nnumerical solution for a black hole deformed by a particular analytic model of\na thin accretion disk. We also discuss how an accretion disk affects the\nanalytical properties of the horizon geometry.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10423v1) |\n| Learning Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation from Spatial\n  Registration | Qianying Liu, Paul Henderson, Xiao Gu, Hang Dai, Fani Deligianni |   Semi-supervised medical image segmentation has shown promise in training\nmodels with limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. However,\nstate-of-the-art methods ignore a potentially valuable source of unsupervised\nsemantic information -- spatial registration transforms between image volumes.\nTo address this, we propose CCT-R, a contrastive cross-teaching framework\nincorporating registration information. To leverage the semantic information\navailable in registrations between volume pairs, CCT-R incorporates two\nproposed modules: Registration Supervision Loss (RSL) and Registration-Enhanced\nPositive Sampling (REPS). The RSL leverages segmentation knowledge derived from\ntransforms between labeled and unlabeled volume pairs, providing an additional\nsource of pseudo-labels. REPS enhances contrastive learning by identifying\nanatomically-corresponding positives across volumes using registration\ntransforms. Experimental results on two challenging medical segmentation\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CCT-R across\nvarious semi-supervised settings, with as few as one labeled case.

A number of recent methods have shown\nhow to perform high-dimensional, unbinned unfolding using machine learning.\nHowever, one of the assumptions in all of these methods is that the detector\nresponse is accurately modeled in the Monte Carlo simulation. In practice, the\ndetector response depends on a number of nuisance parameters that can be\nconstrained with data. We propose a new algorithm called Profile OmniFold\n(POF), which works in a similar iterative manner as the OmniFold (OF) algorithm\nwhile being able to simultaneously profile the nuisance parameters. We\nillustrate the method with a Gaussian example as a proof of concept\nhighlighting its promising capabilities.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10421v1) |\n| HiFi-CS: Towards Open Vocabulary Visual Grounding For Robotic Grasping\n  Using Vision-Language Models | Vineet Bhat, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Ramesh Karri, Farshad Khorrami |   Robots interacting with humans through natural language can unlock numerous\napplications such as Referring Grasp Synthesis (RGS). Given a text query, RGS\ndetermines a stable grasp pose to manipulate the referred object in the robot's\nworkspace. RGS comprises two steps: visual grounding and grasp pose estimation.\nRecent studies leverage powerful Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for visually\ngrounding free-flowing natural language in real-world robotic execution.\nHowever, comparisons in complex, cluttered environments with multiple instances\nof the same object are lacking. This paper introduces HiFi-CS, featuring\nhierarchical application of Featurewise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to fuse image\nand text embeddings, enhancing visual grounding for complex attribute rich text\nqueries encountered in robotic grasping. Visual grounding associates an object\nin 2D/3D space with natural language input and is studied in two scenarios:\nClosed and Open Vocabulary. HiFi-CS features a lightweight decoder combined\nwith a frozen VLM and outperforms competitive baselines in closed vocabulary\nsettings while being 100x smaller in size. Our model can effectively guide\nopen-set object detectors like GroundedSAM to enhance open-vocabulary\nperformance. We validate our approach through real-world RGS experiments using\na 7-DOF robotic arm, achieving 90.33\\% visual grounding accuracy in 15 tabletop\nscenes.

Papoutsis, I. E. Papadakis, C. Panagiotou, M. Dov\u010diak, E. Kammoun |   Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to be variable across all\nwavelengths. Significant observational efforts have been invested in the last\ndecade in studying their ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability. Long and\ndensely sampled, multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns of numerous Seyfert\ngalaxies have been conducted with the aim of determining the X-ray/UV/optical\ncontinuum time lags. Time-lag studies can be used to constrain theoretical\nmodels. The observed time lags can be explained by thermal reprocessing of the\nX-rays illuminating the accretion disc (known as the X-ray reverberation\nmodel). However, the observed light curves contain more information that can be\nused to further constrain physical models. Our primary objective is to\ninvestigate whether, in addition to time lags, the X-ray reverberation model\ncan also explain the UV/optical variability amplitude of nearby Seyferts. To do\nthis, we measured the excess variance of four sources (namely Mrk 509, NGC\n4151, NGC 2617, and Mrk 142) as a function of wavelength using data from\narchival long, multi-wavelength campaigns with Swift, and ground-based\ntelescopes. We also computed the model excess variance in the case of the X-ray\nreverberation model by determining the disc's transfer function and assuming a\nbending power law for the X-ray power spectrum. We tested the validity of the\nmodel by comparing the measured and model variances for a range of accretion\nrates and X-ray source heights. We conclude that the X-ray thermal\nreverberation model can fit both the continuum, UV/optical time lags, as well\nas the variance in these AGNs, for the same physical parameters. Our results\nsuggest that the accretion disc is constant and that all the observed\nUV/optical variations, on timescales of days and up to a few weeks, can be\nfully explained by the variable X-rays as they illuminate the accretion disc.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10417v1) |\n| Local central limit theorem for Mallows measure | Alexey Bufetov, Kailun Chen |   We study the statistics of the Mallows measure on permutations in the limit\npioneered by Starr (2009).

Such walks, inspired by Ising-like models and\nopinions dynamics models, are usually considered in one-dimensional virtual\nspaces. Here, the mapping is done in such a way that the walk is directed along\nthe $y$ axis while it can move either way along the $x$ axis. We explore the\nproperties of such walks as the parameter representing the noise in the opinion\ndynamics model, responsible for a continuous phase transition, is varied. The\nwalk features show marked differences as the system crosses the critical point.\nThe bivariate distribution of the displacements below the critical point is a\nmodified biased Gaussian function of x and y which is symmetric about the X\naxis.\n  The marginal probability distributions can be extracted and the scaling forms\nof different quantities, showing power law behaviour, are obtained. The\ndirected nature of the walk is reflected in the marginal distributions as well\nas in the exponents.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10413v1) |\n| A Large-Scale Privacy Assessment of Android Third-Party SDKs | Mark Huasong Meng, Chuan Yan, Yun Hao, Qing Zhang, Zeyu Wang, Kailong Wang, Sin Gee Teo, Guangdong Bai, Jin Song Dong |   Third-party Software Development Kits (SDKs) are widely adopted in Android\napp development, to effortlessly accelerate development pipelines and enhance\napp functionality. However, this convenience raises substantial concerns about\nunauthorized access to users' privacy-sensitive information, which could be\nfurther abused for illegitimate purposes like user tracking or monetization.\nOur study offers a targeted analysis of user privacy protection among Android\nthird-party SDKs, filling a critical gap in the Android software supply chain.\nIt focuses on two aspects of their privacy practices, including data\nexfiltration and behavior-policy compliance (or privacy compliance), utilizing\ntechniques of taint analysis and large language models. It covers 158\nwidely-used SDKs from two key SDK release platforms, the official one and a\nlarge alternative one. From them, we identified 338 instances of privacy data\nexfiltration. On the privacy compliance, our study reveals that more than 30%\nof the examined SDKs fail to provide a privacy policy to disclose their data\nhandling practices. Among those that provide privacy policies, 37% of them\nover-collect user data, and 88% falsely claim access to sensitive data. We\nrevisit the latest versions of the SDKs after 12 months. Our analysis\ndemonstrates a persistent lack of improvement in these concerning trends. Based\non our findings, we propose three actionable recommendations to mitigate the\nprivacy leakage risks and enhance privacy protection for Android users.

As raw traces obscure the true temporal structure of neuron's\nactivity, we performed a tuned filtering of the calcium concentration using two\nmethods: a biophysical model and a kernel mapping. The former characterizes\nspike trains related to a particular triggering event, while the latter filters\nout the signal and refines the selection of the underlying neuronal response.\nTransitioning from traditional time series analysis to point process theory,\nthe study explores spike-time distance metrics and point pattern prototypes to\ndescribe repeated observations. We assume that the analyzed neuron's firing\nevents, i.e. spike occurrences, are temporal point process events. In\nparticular, the study aims to categorize 47 point patterns by depth, assuming\nthe similarity of spike occurrences within specific depth categories. The\nresults highlight the pivotal roles of depth and stimuli in discerning diverse\ntemporal structures of neuron firing events, confirming the point process\napproach based on prototype analysis is largely useful in the classification of\nspike traces.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10409v1) |\n| Variational closures for composite homogenised fluid flows | Theo Diamantakis, Ruiao Hu |   The Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport is a variational formulation of\nstochastic fluid dynamics introduced to model the effects of unresolved scales,\nwhilst preserving the geometric structure of ideal fluid flows. In this work,\nwe show that the SALT equations can arise from the decomposition of the fluid\nflow map into its mean and fluctuating components. The fluctuating component is\nrealised as a prescribed stochastic diffeomorphism that introduces stochastic\ntransport into the system and we construct it using homogenisation theory. The\ndynamics of the mean component are derived from a variational principle\nutilising particular forms of variations that preserve the composite structure\nof the flow. Using a new variational principle, we show that SALT equations can\narise from random Lagrangians and are equivalent to random coefficient PDEs.

Drawing parallels from the successful application\nof Gibrat's law of proportional growth in explaining city size and word\nfrequency distributions, we tested whether the same principle could account for\nthe log-normal distribution in Bitcoin balances. However, our calculations\nrevealed that the exponent parameters in both the drift and variance terms\ndeviate slightly from one. This suggests that Gibrat's proportional growth rule\nalone does not fully explain the log-normal distribution observed in Bitcoin\nusers' balances. During our exploration, we discovered an intriguing\nphenomenon: Bitcoin users tend to fall into two distinct categories based on\ntheir behavior, which we refer to as ``poor\" and ``wealthy\" users. Poor users,\nwho initially purchase only a small amount of Bitcoin, tend to buy more\nbitcoins first and then sell out all their holdings gradually over time. The\ncertainty of selling all their coins is higher and higher with time. In\ncontrast, wealthy users, who acquire a large amount of Bitcoin from the start,\ntend to sell off their holdings over time. The speed at which they sell their\nbitcoins is lower and lower over time and they will hold at least a small part\nof their initial holdings at last. Interestingly, the wealthier the user, the\nlarger the proportion of their balance and the higher the certainty they tend\nto sell.

In meiosis II mouse oocytes (developing egg cells) awaiting\nfertilisation, the spindle, which is the protein structure responsible for\ndividing genetic material in a cell, must maintain its position near the cell\ncortex (the thin actin network bound to the cell membrane) for many hours.\nHowever, the cytoplasmic streaming that accompanies this stable positioning\nwould intuitively appear to destabilise the spindle position. Here, through a\ncombination of numerical and analytical modelling, we reveal a new,\nhydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning beneath the cortical cap.\nWe show that this stability depends critically on the spindle size and the\nactive driving from the cortex, and demonstrate that stable spindle positioning\ncan result purely from a hydrodynamic suction force exerted on the spindle by\nthe cytoplasmic flow. Our findings show that local fluid dynamic forces can be\nsufficient to stabilise the spindle, explaining robustness against\nperturbations not only perpendicular but also parallel to the cortex.

Since it offers a well-motivated starting point for\nthe study of physics at very high energies, we incorporate an $R^2$ term in the\nPalatini gravity. In addition, afterward the inflation, the inflaton oscillates\nabout the minimum of the inflation potential, and reheats the universe. This\noccurs during the reheating phase, at which the inflaton decays into the\nstandard model particles, which fill the universe. We extend our examination by\nconsidering the reheating effects on inflationary observables by employing the\ndifferent scenarios of the reheat temperature. Supposing the standard thermal\nhistory after inflation, we display the inflationary predictions, $n_s, r,\n\\mathrm{d}n_s/\\mathrm{d}\\ln k$ of $\\beta$-exponential potential with minimal\ncoupling in Palatini $R^2$ gravity.

To mitigate this issue, downstream\ntask-oriented reconstruction optimization has been proposed for a single\ndownstream task. Expanding this optimization to multi-task scenarios is not\nstraightforward. In this work, we extended this optimization to sequentially\nintroduced multiple downstream tasks and demonstrated that a single MR\nreconstruction network can be optimized for multiple downstream tasks by\ndeploying continual learning (MOST). MOST integrated techniques from\nreplay-based continual learning and image-guided loss to overcome catastrophic\nforgetting.

The majority of work that has been\ndone is focused on Deep Learning (DL) based approaches. However, with the\nemergence of new algorithms such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm, there\nis growing interest in exploring alternative approaches that may offer unique\nadvantages in certain domains or applications. One of these domains is\nFederated Learning (FL), in which users privacy is of utmost importance. Due to\nits novelty, FL has seen a surge in the incorporation of personalization\ntechniques to enhance model accuracy while maintaining user privacy under\npersonalized conditions. In this work, we propose a novel approach dubbed TPFL:\nTsetlin-Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into\nclusters based on their confidence towards a specific class. In this way,\nclustering can benefit from two key advantages. Firstly, clients share only\nwhat they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight\naggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been\nenough during the training. This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are\nnon-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID). Secondly, by sharing\nonly weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially\nreduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication\ncost. The results of TPFL demonstrated the highest accuracy on three different\ndatasets; namely MNIST, FashionMNIST and FEMNIST.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10392v1) |\n| Prompt-and-Transfer: Dynamic Class-aware Enhancement for Few-shot\n  Segmentation | Hanbo Bi, Yingchao Feng, Wenhui Diao, Peijin Wang, Yongqiang Mao, Kun Fu, Hongqi Wang, Xian Sun |   For more efficient generalization to unseen domains (classes), most Few-shot\nSegmentation (FSS) would directly exploit pre-trained encoders and only\nfine-tune the decoder, especially in the current era of large models. However,\nsuch fixed feature encoders tend to be class-agnostic, inevitably activating\nobjects that are irrelevant to the target class. In contrast, humans can\neffortlessly focus on specific objects in the line of sight. This paper mimics\nthe visual perception pattern of human beings and proposes a novel and powerful\nprompt-driven scheme, called ``Prompt and Transfer\" (PAT), which constructs a\ndynamic class-aware prompting paradigm to tune the encoder for focusing on the\ninterested object (target class) in the current task. Three key points are\nelaborated to enhance the prompting: 1) Cross-modal linguistic information is\nintroduced to initialize prompts for each task. 2) Semantic Prompt Transfer\n(SPT) that precisely transfers the class-specific semantics within the images\nto prompts. 3) Part Mask Generator (PMG) that works in conjunction with SPT to\nadaptively generate different but complementary part prompts for different\nindividuals. Surprisingly, PAT achieves competitive performance on 4 different\ntasks including standard FSS, Cross-domain FSS (e.g., CV, medical, and remote\nsensing domains), Weak-label FSS, and Zero-shot Segmentation, setting new\nstate-of-the-arts on 11 benchmarks.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10389v1) |\n| Revising the Structure of Recurrent Neural Networks to Eliminate\n  Numerical Derivatives in Forming Physics Informed Loss Terms with Respect to\n  Time | Mahyar Jahani-nasab, Mohamad Ali Bijarchi |   Solving unsteady partial differential equations (PDEs) using recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs) typically requires numerical derivatives between each block of\nthe RNN to form the physics informed loss function. However, this introduces\nthe complexities of numerical derivatives into the training process of these\nmodels. In this study, we propose modifying the structure of the traditional\nRNN to enable the prediction of each block over a time interval, making it\npossible to calculate the derivative of the output with respect to time using\nthe backpropagation algorithm. To achieve this, the time intervals of these\nblocks are overlapped, defining a mutual loss function between them.\nAdditionally, the employment of conditional hidden states enables us to achieve\na unique solution for each block. The forget factor is utilized to control the\ninfluence of the conditional hidden state on the prediction of the subsequent\nblock. This new model, termed the Mutual Interval RNN (MI-RNN), is applied to\nsolve three different benchmarks: the Burgers equation, unsteady heat\nconduction in an irregular domain, and the Green vortex problem. Our results\ndemonstrate that MI-RNN can find the exact solution more accurately compared to\nexisting RNN models. For instance, in the second problem, MI-RNN achieved one\norder of magnitude less relative error compared to the RNN model with numerical\nderivatives.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10388v1) |\n| Sharp decay rate for eigenfunctions of perturbed periodic Schr\u00f6dinger\n  operators | Wencai Liu, Rodrigo Matos, John N. Treuer |   This paper investigates uniqueness results for perturbed periodic\nSchr\\\"odinger operators on $\\mathbb{Z}^d$. Specifically, we consider operators\nof the form $H = -\\Delta + V + v$, where $\\Delta$ is the discrete Laplacian,\n$V: \\mathbb{Z}^d \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a periodic potential, and $v:\n\\mathbb{Z}^d \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ represents a decaying impurity. We\nestablish quantitative conditions under which the equation $-\\Delta u + V u + v\nu = \\lambda u$, for $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}$, admits only the trivial solution\n$u \\equiv 0$. Key applications include the absence of embedded eigenvalues for\noperators with impurities decaying faster than any exponential function and the\ndetermination of sharp decay rates for eigenfunctions. Our findings extend\nprevious works by providing precise decay conditions for impurities and\nanalyzing different spectral regimes of $\\lambda$.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10387v1) |\n| Mamba-ST: State Space Model for Efficient Style Transfer | Filippo Botti, Alex Ergasti, Leonardo Rossi, Tomaso Fontanini, Claudio Ferrari, Massimo Bertozzi, Andrea Prati |   The goal of style transfer is, given a content image and a style source,\ngenerating a new image preserving the content but with the artistic\nrepresentation of the style source. Most of the state-of-the-art architectures\nuse transformers or diffusion-based models to perform this task, despite the\nheavy computational burden that they require. In particular, transformers use\nself- and cross-attention layers which have large memory footprint, while\ndiffusion models require high inference time. To overcome the above, this paper\nexplores a novel design of Mamba, an emergent State-Space Model (SSM), called\nMamba-ST, to perform style transfer. To do so, we adapt Mamba linear equation\nto simulate the behavior of cross-attention layers, which are able to combine\ntwo separate embeddings into a single output, but drastically reducing memory\nusage and time complexity. We modified the Mamba's inner equations so to accept\ninputs from, and combine, two separate data streams. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt the equations of SSMs to a vision\ntask like style transfer without requiring any other module like\ncross-attention or custom normalization layers. An extensive set of experiments\ndemonstrates the superiority and efficiency of our method in performing style\ntransfer compared to transformers and diffusion models. Results show improved\nquality in terms of both ArtFID and FID metrics.

This module employs the Z4c formulation to solve the Einstein\nequations. We demonstrate its accuracy through a series of standard numerical\nrelativity tests, including convergence of the gravitational waveform from\nbinary black hole coalescence. Furthermore, we conduct scaling tests on OLCF\nFrontier and NERSC Perlmutter, where AthenaK exhibits excellent weak scaling\nefficiency of 80% on up to 65,536 AMD MI250X GPUs on Frontier (relative to 4\nGPUs) and strong scaling efficiencies of 84% and 77% on AMD MI250X and NVIDIA\nA100 GPUs on Frontier and Perlmutter respectively. Additionally, we observe a\nsignificant performance boost, with two orders of magnitude speedup ($\\gtrsim\n200\\times$) on a GPU compared to a single CPU core, affirming that AthenaK is\nwell-suited for exascale computing, thereby expanding the potential for\nbreakthroughs in numerical relativity research.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10383v1) |\n| J-UBIK: The JAX-accelerated Universal Bayesian Imaging Kit | Vincent Eberle, Matteo Guardiani, Margret Westerkamp, Philipp Frank, Julian R\u00fcstig, Julia Stadler, Torsten A. En\u00dflin |   Many advances in astronomy and astrophysics originate from accurate images of\nthe sky emission across multiple wavelengths. This often requires\nreconstructing spatially and spectrally correlated signals detected from\nmultiple instruments. To facilitate the high-fidelity imaging of these signals,\nwe introduce the universal Bayesian imaging kit (UBIK). Specifically, we\npresent J-UBIK, a flexible and modular implementation leveraging the\nJAX-accelerated NIFTy.re software as its backend. J-UBIK streamlines the\nimplementation of the key Bayesian inference components, providing for all the\nnecessary steps of Bayesian imaging pipelines. First, it provides adaptable\nprior models for different sky realizations. Second, it includes likelihood\nmodels tailored to specific instruments. So far, the package includes three\ninstruments: Chandra and eROSITA for X-ray observations, and the James Webb\nSpace Telescope (JWST) for the near- and mid-infrared. The aim is to expand\nthis set in the future. Third, these models can be integrated with various\ninference and optimization schemes, such as maximum a posteriori estimation and\nvariational inference. Explicit demos show how to integrate the individual\nmodules into a full analysis pipeline. Overall, J-UBIK enables efficient\ngeneration of high-fidelity images via Bayesian pipelines that can be tailored\nto specific research objectives.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10381v1) |\n| Thermolectricity in irradiated bilayer graphene flakes | Cynthia Ihuoma Osuala, Tanu Choudhary, Raju K. Biswas, Sudin Ganguly, Chunlei Qu, Santanu K. Maiti |   We present a comprehensive study on enhancing the thermoelectric (TE)\nperformance of bilayer graphene (BLG) through irradiation with arbitrarily\npolarized light, focusing on $AA$- and $AB$-stacked configurations with zigzag\nedges. Utilizing a combination of tight-binding theory and density functional\ntheory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on\nelectronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the\nelectronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function,\nwhich significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the\noverall {\\it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT\ncalculations reveal that $AB$-stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal\nconductivity compared to $AA$-stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic\nscattering and phonon group velocity. The combined analysis shows that FOM\nexceeds unity in both stacking types, with notable improvements near the\nirradiation-induced gap. Additionally, we explore the dependence of FOM on the\nsystem dimensions and temperature, demonstrating that light-irradiated BLG\nholds great promise for efficient thermoelectric energy conversion and waste\nheat recovery. Our results show favorable responses over a wide range of\nirradiation parameters. These findings provide crucial insights into optimizing\nBLG for advanced TE applications through light-induced modifications.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10380v1) |\n| Leveraging Joint Spectral and Spatial Learning with MAMBA for\n  Multichannel Speech Enhancement | Wenze Ren, Haibin Wu, Yi-Cheng Lin, Xuanjun Chen, Rong Chao, Kuo-Hsuan Hung, You-Jin Li, Wen-Yuan Ting, Hsin-Min Wang, Yu Tsao |   In multichannel speech enhancement, effectively capturing spatial and\nspectral information across different microphones is crucial for noise\nreduction. Traditional methods, such as CNN or LSTM, attempt to model the\ntemporal dynamics of full-band and sub-band spectral and spatial features.\nHowever, these approaches face limitations in fully modeling complex temporal\ndependencies, especially in dynamic acoustic environments.

Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that MCMamba significantly improves the\nmodeling of spatial and spectral features in multichannel speech enhancement,\noutperforming McNet and achieving state-of-the-art performance on the CHiME-3\ndataset. Additionally, we find that Mamba performs exceptionally well in\nmodeling spectral information.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10376v1) |\n| Nonlinear Causality in Brain Networks: With Application to Motor Imagery\n  vs Execution | Sipan Aslan, Hernando Ombao |   One fundamental challenge of data-driven analysis in neuroscience is modeling\ncausal interactions and exploring the connectivity of nodes in a brain network.\nVarious statistical methods, relying on various perspectives and employing\ndifferent data modalities, are being developed to examine and comprehend the\nunderlying causal structures inherent to brain dynamics. This study introduces\na novel statistical approach, TAR4C, to dissect causal interactions in\nmultichannel EEG recordings. TAR4C uses the threshold autoregressive model to\ndescribe the causal interaction between nodes or clusters of nodes in a brain\nnetwork. The perspective involves testing whether one node, which may represent\na brain region, can control the dynamics of the other. The node that has such\nan impact on the other is called a threshold variable and can be classified as\na causative because its functionality is the leading source operating as an\ninstantaneous switching mechanism that regulates the time-varying\nautoregressive structure of the other. This statistical concept is commonly\nreferred to as threshold non-linearity. Once threshold non-linearity has been\nverified between a pair of nodes, the subsequent essential facet of TAR\nmodeling is to assess the predictive ability of the causal node for the current\nactivity on the other and represent causal interactions in autoregressive\nterms. This predictive ability is what underlies Granger causality. The TAR4C\napproach can discover non-linear and time-dependent causal interactions without\nnegating the G-causality perspective. The efficacy of the proposed approach is\nexemplified by analyzing the EEG signals recorded during the motor\nmovement/imagery experiment. The similarities and differences between the\ncausal interactions manifesting during the execution and the imagery of a given\nmotor movement are demonstrated by analyzing EEG recordings from multiple\nsubjects.\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10374v1) |\n| Instigating Cooperation among LLM Agents Using Adaptive Information\n  Modulation | Qiliang Chen,  Alireza,  Ilami, Nunzio Lore, Babak Heydari |   This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for\nhuman strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these\nagents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments.

Their widespread\nindustrial use and resistance to degradation have led to global environmental\ncontamination and significant health concerns. While a minority of PFAS have\nbeen extensively studied, the toxicity of many PFAS remains poorly understood\ndue to limited direct toxicological data. This study advances the predictive\nmodeling of PFAS toxicity by combining semi-supervised graph convolutional\nnetworks (GCNs) with molecular descriptors and fingerprints. We propose a novel\napproach to enhance the prediction of PFAS binding affinities by isolating\nmolecular fingerprints to construct graphs where then descriptors are set as\nthe node features. This approach specifically captures the structural,\nphysicochemical, and topological features of PFAS without overfitting due to an\nabundance of features. Unsupervised clustering then identifies representative\ncompounds for detailed binding studies.

To meet\nperformance constraints, state-of-the-art control methods such as Incremental\nNonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) or other adaptive control techniques require\nhigh control gains to mitigate the effects of uncertainty entering the system.\nWhile achieving good tracking performance, IDNI requires excessive control\neffort, results in high actuator strain, and reduced flight smoothness due to\nconstant and aggressive corrective actions commanded by the controller.

Conventional models\npredominantly relying on radar data have limited performance in predicting\ncases with complex temporal features such as convection initiation,\nhighlighting the need to integrate data from other sources for more\ncomprehensive nowcasting. Unlike physics-based models, machine learning\n(ML)-based models offer promising solutions for efficiently integrating large\nvolumes of diverse data. We present EF4INCA, a spatiotemporal Transformer model\nfor precipitation nowcasting that integrates satellite- and ground-based\nobservations with numerical weather prediction outputs. EF4INCA provides\nhigh-resolution forecasts over Austria, accurately predicting the location and\nshape of precipitation fields with a spatial resolution of 1 kilometre and a\ntemporal resolution of 5 minutes, up to 90 minutes ahead. Our evaluation shows\nthat EF4INCA outperforms conventional nowcasting models, including the\noperational model of Austria, particularly in scenarios with complex temporal\nfeatures such as convective initiation and rapid weather changes. EF4INCA\nmaintains higher accuracy in location forecasting but generates smoother fields\nat later prediction times compared to traditional models. Interpretation of our\nmodel showed that precipitation products and SEVIRI infrared channels CH7 and\nCH9 are the most important data streams.

RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of\\nlong-context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the\\nmodel accuracy. Especially, RetrievalAttention only needs 16GB GPU memory for\\nserving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating\\none token in 0.188 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB).\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516v1) |\\n| An Efficient Self-Learning Framework For Interactive Spoken Dialog\\n  Systems | Hitesh Tulsiani, David M.

Unfortunately, traditional automatic speech\\nrecognition (ASR) systems deployed in such applications are usually trained to\\nrecognize each turn independently and lack the ability to adapt to the\\nconversational context or incorporate user feedback. In this work, we introduce\\na general framework for ASR in dialog systems that can go beyond learning from\\nsingle-turn utterances and learn over time how to adapt to both explicit\\nsupervision and implicit user feedback present in multi-turn conversations. We\\naccomplish that by leveraging advances in student-teacher learning and\\ncontext-aware dialog processing, and designing contrastive self-supervision\\napproaches with Ohm, a new online hard-negative mining approach. We show that\\nleveraging our new framework compared to traditional training leads to relative\\nWER reductions of close to 10% in real-world dialog systems, and up to 26% on\\npublic synthetic data.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10515v1) |\\n| Constraints on axions from patchy screening of the cosmic microwave\\n  background | Samuel Goldstein, Fiona McCarthy, Cristina Mondino, J.

We propose an LLM-based translation\\nscheme that improves the success rate of translating large-scale C code into\\ncompilable Rust code. Our approach involves three key techniques: (1)\\npre-processing the C code to better align its structure and expressions with\\nRust, (2) segmenting the code into optimally sized translation units to avoid\\nexceeding the LLM's context window limits, and (3) iteratively compiling and\\nrepairing errors while maintaining consistency between translation units using\\ncontext-supplementing prompts. Compilation success is an essential first step\\nin achieving functional equivalence, as only compilable code can be further\\ntested. In experiments with 20 benchmark C programs, including those exceeding\\n4 kilo lines of code, we successfully translated all programs into compilable\\nRust code without losing corresponding parts of the original code.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10506v1) |\\n| Machine Learning Optimization of non-Kasha Behavior and of Transient\\n  Dynamics in Model Retinal Isomerization | Davinder Singh, Chern Chuang, Paul Brumer |   Designing a model of retinal isomerization in Rhodopsin, the first step in\\nvision, that accounts for both experimental transient and stationary state\\nobservables is challenging.

However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning\\ncapabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this\\nwork, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as\\nsolving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to\\nsearch over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then\\napply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the\\napplication of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in\\na cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases,\\nmultiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We\\nobserve that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn\\nto solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21\\\\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly)\\nwhen trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that\\ntraining Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and\\nwithout such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis\\nto Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves\\n$92.04 \\\\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal\\nrepresentations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear\\nprobing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any\\ngiven cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine\\nimplicit in the Transformer weights.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10502v1) |\\n| Alignment with nonlinear velocity couplings: collision-avoidance and\\n  micro-to-macro mean-field limits | Young-Pil Choi, Micha\\u0142 Fabisiak, Jan Peszek |   We investigate the pressureless fractional Euler-alignment system with\\nnonlinear velocity couplings, referred to as the $p$-Euler-alignment system.\\nThis model features a nonlinear velocity alignment force, interpreted as a\\ndensity-weighted fractional $p$-Laplacian when the singularity parameter\\n$\\\\alpha$ exceeds the spatial dimension $d$. Our primary goal is to establish\\nthe existence of solutions for strongly singular interactions ($\\\\alpha \\\\ge d$)\\nand compactly supported initial conditions.

Nevertheless,\\nin this (as in any other) quantum-computing platform, many technical questions\\nstill have to be resolved before large-scale and error-tolerant applications\\nare possible. In this work, we present a thorough discussion of the\\ncontribution of higher-order terms to the MAGIC setup, which can occur due to\\nanharmonicities in the external potential of the ion crystal (e.g., through\\nCoulomb repulsion) or through curvature of the applied magnetic field. These\\nterms take the form of three-spin couplings as well as diverse terms that\\ncouple spins to phonons. We find that most of these are negligible in realistic\\nsituations, with only two contributions that need careful attention. First,\\nthere are parasitic longitudinal fields whose strength increases with chain\\nlength, but which can easily be compensated by a microwave detuning. Second,\\nanharmonicities of the Coulomb interaction can lead to well-known two-to-one\\nconversions of phonon excitations, which can be avoided if the phonons are\\nground-state cooled.

Ruan, Michael Eracleous, Daryl Haggard, Jessie C. Runnoe |   The physical processes that produce X-ray Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs)\\nrecently discovered from the nuclei of several low-redshift galaxies are\\nmysterious. Several pieces of observational evidence strongly suggest a link\\nbetween QPEs and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE). Previous studies also reveal\\nthat the morphologies of TDE host galaxies are highly concentrated, with high\\nSersic indicies, bulge-to-total light (B/T) ratios, and stellar surface mass\\ndensities relative to the broader galaxy population. We use these distinctive\\nproperties to test the link between QPEs and TDEs, by comparing these\\nparameters of QPE host galaxies to TDE host galaxies. We employ archival Legacy\\nSurvey images of a sample of 9 QPE host galaxies and a sample of 13 TDE host\\ngalaxies, and model their surface brightness profiles. We show that QPE host\\ngalaxies have high Sersic indices of ~3, high B/T ratios of ~0.5, and high\\nsurface mass densities of ~10^10 Msun kpc^-2. These properties are similar to\\nTDE host galaxies, but are in strong contrast to a mass- and redshift-matched\\ncontrol sample of galaxies. We also find tentative evidence that the central\\nblack holes in both QPE and TDE host galaxies are undermassive relative to\\ntheir stellar mass. The morphological similarities between QPE and TDE host\\ngalaxies at the population level add to the mounting evidence of a physical\\nlink between these phenomena, and favor QPE models that also invoke TDEs.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10486v1) |\\n| Tuning the Rate of Tightly Packed Systems To Produce Planet Occurrence\\n  Trends with Galactic Height | Sarah Ballard |   The formation of planetary systems has historically been considered in\\nisolation, decoupled from processes on galactic scales. Recent findings\\nemploying data from ESA's Gaia mission challenge this narrative, identifying\\ntrends in planet occurrence with galactic kinematics and stellar age. The\\nfindings indicate changes in planet occurrence over and above the predicted\\nchanges from metallicity variation within the Milky Way, so that changes to\\nstellar metallicity alone (long understood to be deterministic in planet\\noutcomes) cannot explain the trends entirely. The scope of potential factors\\ninfluencing planet formation has grown progressively wider, with accompanying\\ntheoretical support for galactic-scale influences upon planet formation. In\\nthis manuscript, we investigate specifically how changes to the rate of Systems\\nof Tightly-packed Inner Planets (STIPs) could manifest as a trend in planet\\noccurrence with galactic height. We focus our study upon M dwarf planetary\\nsystems for two reasons: first, they host STIPs at high rates, and secondly,\\ntheir longevity makes them useful probes for kinematic trends over Gyr. We\\nconsider two models for a varying STIP rate: one in which STIP likelihood is\\ndetermined by stellar age alone, irrespective of galactic time, and another in\\nwhich the STIP likelihood suddenly increased in recent galactic history. Both\\nmodels, which impose a higher STIP likelihood among younger stars, produce a\\nnegative gradient in planet occurrence with increasing height from the galactic\\nmidplane. We find that a step function model in which STIP likelihood increased\\nby a factor of several ~a few Gyr ago resembles an observed trend among FGK\\ndwarfs. We consider plausible physical mechanisms that could mimic the\\nhypothesized model, given known links between STIP occurrence and other stellar\\nand planetary properties.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10485v1) |\\n| XLM for Autonomous Driving Systems: A Comprehensive Review | Sonda Fourati, Wael Jaafar, Noura Baccar, Safwan Alfattani |   Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable proficiency in various\\ninformation-processing tasks.

These interactions have a particularly\\nprofound effect on excitation energies of molecules in complex environments,\\nespecially when the excitation involves a significant degree of charge\\nreorganisation. The direct reaction field (DRF) approach, which has seen a\\nrecent revival of interest, provides a powerful framework for describing these\\ninteractions in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models of\\nsystems, where a small subsystem of interest is described using quantum\\nchemical methods and the remainder is treated with a simple MM force field.

These assumptions limit their use\\nwhen acquisition conditions, such as the subject's distance from the camera or\\nthe camera's characteristics, are different than expected, as typically happens\\nin video surveillance.

Given that perfect model alignment with reality is\\noften unrealistic in practice, we focus on scenarios where the chosen\\nhypothesis set is misspecified. In this context, it remains unclear whether\\ncurrent contextual optimization approaches can effectively address such model\\nmisspecification. In this paper, we present a novel integrated learning and\\noptimization approach designed to tackle model misspecification in contextual\\noptimization. This approach offers theoretical generalizability, tractability,\\nand optimality guarantees, along with strong practical performance. Our method\\ninvolves minimizing a tractable surrogate loss that aligns with the performance\\nvalue from cost vector predictions, regardless of whether the model\\nmisspecified or not, and can be optimized in reasonable time. To our knowledge,\\nno previous work has provided an approach with such guarantees in the context\\nof model misspecification.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10479v1) |\\n| Local SGD for Near-Quadratic Problems: Improving Convergence under\\n  Unconstrained Noise Conditions | Andrey Sadchikov, Savelii Chezhegov, Aleksandr Beznosikov, Alexander Gasnikov |   Distributed optimization plays an important role in modern large-scale\\nmachine learning and data processing systems by optimizing the utilization of\\ncomputational resources. One of the classical and popular approaches is Local\\nStochastic Gradient Descent (Local SGD), characterized by multiple local\\nupdates before averaging, which is particularly useful in distributed\\nenvironments to reduce communication bottlenecks and improve scalability. A\\ntypical feature of this method is the dependence on the frequency of\\ncommunications. But in the case of a quadratic target function with homogeneous\\ndata distribution over all devices, the influence of frequency of\\ncommunications vanishes. As a natural consequence, subsequent studies include\\nthe assumption of a Lipschitz Hessian, as this indicates the similarity of the\\noptimized function to a quadratic one to some extent. However, in order to\\nextend the completeness of the Local SGD theory and unlock its potential, in\\nthis paper we abandon the Lipschitz Hessian assumption by introducing a new\\nconcept of $\\\\textit{approximate quadraticity}$. This assumption gives a new\\nperspective on problems that have near quadratic properties. In addition,\\nexisting theoretical analyses of Local SGD often assume bounded variance. We,\\nin turn, consider the unbounded noise condition, which allows us to broaden the\\nclass of studied problems.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10478v1) |\\n| SimInversion: A Simple Framework for Inversion-Based Text-to-Image\\n  Editing | Qi Qian, Haiyang Xu, Ming Yan, Juhua Hu |   Diffusion models demonstrate impressive image generation performance with\\ntext guidance. Inspired by the learning process of diffusion, existing images\\ncan be edited according to text by DDIM inversion. However, the vanilla DDIM\\ninversion is not optimized for classifier-free guidance and the accumulated\\nerror will result in the undesired performance. While many algorithms are\\ndeveloped to improve the framework of DDIM inversion for editing, in this work,\\nwe investigate the approximation error in DDIM inversion and propose to\\ndisentangle the guidance scale for the source and target branches to reduce the\\nerror while keeping the original framework. Moreover, a better guidance scale\\n(i.e., 0.5) than default settings can be derived theoretically. Experiments on\\nPIE-Bench show that our proposal can improve the performance of DDIM inversion\\ndramatically without sacrificing efficiency.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10476v1) |\\n| Leadership and Engagement Dynamics in Legislative Twitter Networks:\\n  Statistical Analysis and Modeling | Carolina Luque, Juan Sosa |   In this manuscript, we analyze the interaction network on Twitter among\\nmembers of the 117th U.S. Congress to assess the visibility of political\\nleaders and explore how systemic properties and node attributes influence the\\nformation of legislative connections. We employ descriptive social network\\nstatistical methods, the exponential random graph model (ERGM), and the\\nstochastic block model (SBM) to evaluate the relative impact of network\\nsystemic properties, as well as institutional and personal traits, on the\\ngeneration of online relationships among legislators. Our findings reveal that\\nlegislative networks on social media platforms like Twitter tend to reinforce\\nthe leadership of dominant political actors rather than diminishing their\\ninfluence.

However, previous works either rely on contrastive learning that\\nsuffers false negative problems or are based on reconstruction that learns too\\nmuch unessential low-level clues, leading to limited representations for\\ndownstream tasks. Recently, great advances have been made in generative\\nlearning, which is naturally a challenging yet meaningful pretext task to model\\nthe general underlying data distributions. However, the representation learning\\ncapacity of generative models is under-explored, especially for the skeletons\\nwith spacial sparsity and temporal redundancy. To this end, we propose Masked\\nConditional Diffusion (MacDiff) as a unified framework for human skeleton\\nmodeling. For the first time, we leverage diffusion models as effective\\nskeleton representation learners. Specifically, we train a diffusion decoder\\nconditioned on the representations extracted by a semantic encoder. Random\\nmasking is applied to encoder inputs to introduce a information bottleneck and\\nremove redundancy of skeletons. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that\\nour generative objective involves the contrastive learning objective which\\naligns the masked and noisy views. Meanwhile, it also enforces the\\nrepresentation to complement for the noisy view, leading to better\\ngeneralization performance. MacDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on\\nrepresentation learning benchmarks while maintaining the competence for\\ngenerative tasks. Moreover, we leverage the diffusion model for data\\naugmentation, significantly enhancing the fine-tuning performance in scenarios\\nwith scarce labeled data.

Hassan |   The proliferation of open Pre-trained Language Models (PTLMs) on model\\nregistry platforms like Hugging Face (HF) presents both opportunities and\\nchallenges for companies building products around them. Similar to traditional\\nsoftware dependencies, PTLMs continue to evolve after a release. However, the\\ncurrent state of release practices of PTLMs on model registry platforms are\\nplagued by a variety of inconsistencies, such as ambiguous naming conventions\\nand inaccessible model training documentation. Given the knowledge gap on\\ncurrent PTLM release practices, our empirical study uses a mixed-methods\\napproach to analyze the releases of 52,227 PTLMs on the most well-known model\\nregistry, HF. Our results reveal 148 different naming practices for PTLM\\nreleases, with 40.87% of changes to model weight files not represented in the\\nadopted name-based versioning practice or their documentation. In addition, we\\nidentified that the 52,227 PTLMs are derived from only 299 different base\\nmodels (the modified original models used to create 52,227 PTLMs), with\\nFine-tuning and Quantization being the most prevalent modification methods\\napplied to these base models. Significant gaps in release transparency, in\\nterms of training dataset specifications and model card availability, still\\nexist, highlighting the need for standardized documentation. While we\\nidentified a model naming practice explicitly differentiating between major and\\nminor PTLM releases, we did not find any significant difference in the types of\\nchanges that went into either type of releases, suggesting that major/minor\\nversion numbers for PTLMs often are chosen arbitrarily. Our findings provide\\nvaluable insights to improve PTLM release practices, nudging the field towards\\nmore formal semantic versioning practices.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10472v1) |\\n| Real-Time Whole-Body Control of Legged Robots with Model-Predictive Path\\n  Integral Control | Juan Alvarez-Padilla, John Z.

F. Lizarraga, Flavia M. D. Marquitti, Marcus A. M. de Aguiar |   We investigate the role of assortative mating in speciation using the\\nsympatric model of Derrida and Higgs. The model explores the idea that genetic\\ndifferences create incompatibilities between individuals, preventing mating if\\nthe number of such differences is too large. Speciation, however, only happens\\nin this mating system if the number of genes is large. Here we show that\\nspeciation with small genome sizes can occur if assortative mating is\\nintroduced. In our model individuals are represented by three chromosomes: one\\nresponsible for reproductive compatibility, one for coding the trait on which\\nassortativity will operate, and a neutral chromosome. Reproduction is possible\\nif individuals are genetically similar with respect to the first chromosome,\\nbut among these compatible mating partners, the one with the most similar trait\\ncoded by the second chromosome is selected. We show that this type of\\nassortativity facilitates speciation, which can happen with a small number of\\ngenes in the first chromosome. Species, classified according to reproductive\\nisolation, dictated by the first chromosome, can display different traits\\nvalues, as measured by the second and the third chromosomes. Therefore, species\\ncan also be identified based on similarity of the neutral trait, which works as\\na proxy for reproductive isolation.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10466v1) |\\n| A stabilized total pressure-formulation of the Biot's poroelasticity\\n  equations in frequency domain: numerical analysis and applications | Cristian C\\u00e1rcamo, Alfonso Caiazzo, Felipe Galarce, Joaqu\\u00edn Mura |   This work focuses on the numerical solution of the dynamics of a poroelastic\\nmaterial in the frequency domain.

In\\nthis work we give multiple results related to the property testing of direct\\nsums.\\n  Our first result concerns a test proposed by Dinur and Golubev in 2019. We\\ncall their test the Diamond test and show that it is indeed a direct sum\\ntester.

Even in the case of $n = 2$, the\\nDiamond test is, to the best of our knowledge, novel and yields a new tester\\nfor the classic property of affinity.\\n  Apart from the Diamond test, we also analyze a broad family of direct sum\\ntests, which at a high level, run an arbitrary affinity test on the restriction\\nof $f$ to a random hypercube inside of $[n]^d$.

As an application of our result, we obtain a direct sum test which works\\nin the online adversary model of \\\\cite{KRV}.\\n  Finally, we also discuss a Fourier analytic interpretation of the diamond\\ntester in the $n=2$ case, as well as prove local correction results for direct\\nsum as conjectured by Dinur and Golubev.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10464v1) |\\n| Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks in Low-Data Regimes: A Comparative Study with\\n  Multilayer Perceptrons | Farhad Pourkamali-Anaraki |   Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) have long been a cornerstone in deep learning,\\nknown for their capacity to model complex relationships. Recently,\\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a compelling alternative,\\nutilizing highly flexible learnable activation functions directly on network\\nedges, a departure from the neuron-centric approach of MLPs. However, KANs\\nsignificantly increase the number of learnable parameters, raising concerns\\nabout their effectiveness in data-scarce environments. This paper presents a\\ncomprehensive comparative study of MLPs and KANs from both algorithmic and\\nexperimental perspectives, with a focus on low-data regimes. We introduce an\\neffective technique for designing MLPs with unique, parameterized activation\\nfunctions for each neuron, enabling a more balanced comparison with KANs. Using\\nempirical evaluations on simulated data and two real-world data sets from\\nmedicine and engineering, we explore the trade-offs between model complexity\\nand accuracy, with particular attention to the role of network depth. Our\\nfindings show that MLPs with individualized activation functions achieve\\nsignificantly higher predictive accuracy with only a modest increase in\\nparameters, especially when the sample size is limited to around one hundred.\\nFor example, in a three-class classification problem within additive\\nmanufacturing, MLPs achieve a median accuracy of 0.91, significantly\\noutperforming KANs, which only reach a median accuracy of 0.53 with default\\nhyperparameters. These results offer valuable insights into the impact of\\nactivation function selection in neural networks.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10463v1) |\\n| Effects of synapse location, delay and background stochastic activity on\\n  synchronising hippocampal CA1 neurons | Alessandro Fiasconaro, Michele Migliore |   We study the synchronisation of neurons in a realistic model under the\\nHodgkin-Huxley dynamics. To focus on the role of the different locations of the\\nexcitatory synapses, we use two identical neurons where the set of input\\nsignals is grouped at two different distances from the soma. The system is\\nintended to represent a CA1 hippocampal neuron in which the synapses arriving\\nfrom the CA3 neurons of the trisynaptic pathway appear to be localised in the\\napical dendritic region and are, in principle, either proximal or distal to the\\nsoma. Synchronisation is studied using a specifically defined spiking\\ncorrelation function as a function of various parameters such as the distance\\nfrom the soma of one of the synaptic groups, the inhibition weight and the\\nassociated activation delay. We found that the neurons' spiking activity\\ndepends nonmonotonically on the relative dendritic location of the synapses and\\ntheir inhibitory weight, whereas the synchronisation measure always decreases\\nwith inhibition, and strongly depends on its activation time delay. The\\nbackground activity on the somas results essentially independent on the\\nfluctuation intensity and strongly support the importance of the balance\\nbetween inhibition and excitation for neuronal synchronization.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10460v1) |\\n| Efficiently Crowdsourcing Visual Importance with Punch-Hole Annotation | Minsuk Chang, Soohyun Lee, Aeri Cho, Hyeon Jeon, Seokhyeon Park, Cindy Xiong Bearfield, Jinwook Seo |   We introduce a novel crowdsourcing method for identifying important areas in\\ngraphical images through punch-hole labeling. Traditional methods, such as gaze\\ntrackers and mouse-based annotations, which generate continuous data, can be\\nimpractical in crowdsourcing scenarios. They require many participants, and the\\noutcome data can be noisy. In contrast, our method first segments the graphical\\nimage with a grid and drops a portion of the patches (punch holes). Then, we\\niteratively ask the labeler to validate each annotation with holes, narrowing\\ndown the annotation only having the most important area. This approach aims to\\nreduce annotation noise in crowdsourcing by standardizing the annotations while\\nenhancing labeling efficiency and reliability. Preliminary findings from\\nfundamental charts demonstrate that punch-hole labeling can effectively\\npinpoint critical regions. This also highlights its potential for broader\\napplication in visualization research, particularly in studying large-scale\\nusers' graphical perception.

Chodas |   This work is dedicated to debias the Near-Earth Objects (NEO) population\\nbased on observations from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System\\n(ATLAS) telescopes. We have applied similar methods used to develop the\\nrecently released NEO model generator (NEOMOD), once debiasing the NEO\\npopulation using data from Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) G96 telescope. ATLAS is\\ncomposed of four different telescopes. We first analyzed observational data\\nfrom each of all four telescopes separately and later combined them. Our\\nresults highlight main differences between CSS and ATLAS, e.g., sky coverage\\nand survey power at debiasing the NEO population. ATLAS has a much larger sky\\ncoverage than CSS, allowing it to find bright NEOs that would be constantly\\n\\\"hiding\\\" from CSS. Consequently, ATLAS is more powerful than CSS at debiasing\\nthe NEO population for H $\\\\lesssim$ 19. With its intrinsically greater\\nsensitivity and emphasis on observing near opposition, CSS excels in the\\ndebiasing of smaller objects. ATLAS, as an all sky survey designed to find\\nimminent hazardous objects, necessarily spends a significant fraction of time\\nlooking at places on the sky where objects do not appear, reducing its power\\nfor debiasing the population of small objects.

Behavior trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robot\\ntask planning for their modularity and flexibility, but manually designing them\\ncan be effort-intensive. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been\\napplied in robotic task planning for generating action sequences, but their\\nability to generate BTs has not been fully investigated. To this end, We\\npropose LLM as BT-planner, a novel framework to leverage LLMs for BT generation\\nin robotic assembly task planning and execution. Four in-context learning\\nmethods are introduced to utilize the natural language processing and inference\\ncapabilities of LLMs to produce task plans in BT format, reducing manual effort\\nand ensuring robustness and comprehensibility. We also evaluate the performance\\nof fine-tuned, fewer-parameter LLMs on the same tasks. Experiments in simulated\\nand real-world settings show that our framework enhances LLMs' performance in\\nBT generation, improving success rates in BT generation through in-context\\nlearning and supervised fine-tuning.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10444v1) |\\n| The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration.

Aguilar, Ralph Bohlin, Misty Cracraft, Marjorie Decleir, Andras Gaspar, David R. Law, Alberto Noriega-Crespo, Michael Regan |   The absolute flux calibration of the Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and\\nCoronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first\\n2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the\\nflux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays,\\nand different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining\\nobserved aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions\\nbased on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of\\nthese observations were combined with model point-spread-functions to measure\\nthe corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with\\ntime, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time,\\nrate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations\\nwere with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately\\nevery month revealed a modest time-dependent response loss seen mainly at the\\nlongest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential\\nwith a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the\\nband-dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was\\nfound to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different\\nsubarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting\\nfor the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors\\nmeasured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The\\nformal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are\\n0.3 to 1.0%, with longer-wavelength bands generally having larger\\nuncertainties.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10443v1) |\\n| CtRNet-X: Camera-to-Robot Pose Estimation in Real-world Conditions Using\\n  a Single Camera | Jingpei Lu, Zekai Liang, Tristin Xie, Florian Ritcher, Shan Lin, Sainan Liu, Michael C. Yip |   Camera-to-robot calibration is crucial for vision-based robot control and\\nrequires effort to make it accurate. Recent advancements in markerless pose\\nestimation methods have eliminated the need for time-consuming physical setups\\nfor camera-to-robot calibration. While the existing markerless pose estimation\\nmethods have demonstrated impressive accuracy without the need for cumbersome\\nsetups, they rely on the assumption that all the robot joints are visible\\nwithin the camera's field of view. However, in practice, robots usually move in\\nand out of view, and some portion of the robot may stay out-of-frame during the\\nwhole manipulation task due to real-world constraints, leading to a lack of\\nsufficient visual features and subsequent failure of these approaches. To\\naddress this challenge and enhance the applicability to vision-based robot\\ncontrol, we propose a novel framework capable of estimating the robot pose with\\npartially visible robot manipulators. Our approach leverages the\\nVision-Language Models for fine-grained robot components detection, and\\nintegrates it into a keypoint-based pose estimation network, which enables more\\nrobust performance in varied operational conditions. The framework is evaluated\\non both public robot datasets and self-collected partial-view datasets to\\ndemonstrate our robustness and generalizability. As a result, this method is\\neffective for robot pose estimation in a wider range of real-world manipulation\\nscenarios.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10441v1) |\\n| Successive topological phase transitions in two distinct spin-flop\\n  phases on the honeycomb lattice | Xudong Li, Jize Zhao, Jinbin Li, Qiang Luo |   The Kitaev magnets with bond-dependent interactions have garnered\\nconsiderable attention in recent years for their ability to harbor exotic\\nphases and nontrivial excitations. The topological magnons, which are indicated\\nby nonzero Chern number and thermal Hall conductivity, are proposed to\\npartially explain thermal Hall measurements in real materials. Hitherto,\\ntopological magnons have been extensively explored when the magnetic field is\\nnormal to the honeycomb plane, but their topological characteristics are less\\nstudied in the presence of in-plane magnetic field. Here, we study two distinct\\nin-plane field induced spin-flop phases in the $\\\\Gamma$-$\\\\Gamma'$ model, both\\nof which are off-diagonal couplings that have intimate relation to the Kitaev\\ninteraction. The two spin-flop phases are distinguished by their out-of-plane\\nspin components which can be either antiparallel or parallel, thus dubbing\\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) spin-flop phases, respectively.\\nWe map out topological phase diagrams for both phases, revealing a rich pattern\\nof the Chern number over exchange parameters and magnetic field. We\\nanalytically calculate the boundaries of topological phase transitions when the\\nmagnetic field is along the $a$ and $b$ directions. We find that the thermal\\nHall conductivity and its derivative display contrasting behaviors when\\ncrossing different topological phase transitions. The striking difference of\\nthe two phases lies in that when the magnetic field is along the $b$ direction,\\ntopological magnons are totally absent in the AFM spin-flop phase, while they\\ncan survive in the FM analogue in certain parameter regions.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10439v1) |\\n| A functorial approach to $n$-abelian categories | Vitor Gulisz |   We develop a functorial approach to the study of $n$-abelian categories by\\nreformulating their axioms in terms of their categories of finitely presented\\nfunctors.

The vast majority of\\nenergy-preserving reduced-order methods use symplectic Galerkin projection to\\nconstruct reduced-order Hamiltonian models by projecting the full models onto a\\nsymplectic subspace. However, symplectic projection requires the existence of\\nfully discrete operators, and in many cases, such as black-box PDE solvers,\\nthese operators are inaccessible. In this work, we propose an energy-preserving\\nmachine learning method that can infer the dynamics of the given PDE using data\\nonly, so that the proposed framework does not depend on the fully discrete\\noperators. In this context, the proposed method is non-intrusive. The proposed\\nmethod is grey box in the sense that it requires only some basic knowledge of\\nthe multi-symplectic model at the partial differential equation level. We prove\\nthat the proposed method satisfies spatially discrete local energy conservation\\nand preserves the multi-symplectic conservation laws. We test our method on the\\nlinear wave equation, the Korteweg-de Vries equation, and the\\nZakharov-Kuznetsov equation.

Papoutsis, I. E. Papadakis, C. Panagiotou, M. Dov\\u010diak, E. Kammoun |   Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to be variable across all\\nwavelengths. Significant observational efforts have been invested in the last\\ndecade in studying their ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability. Long and\\ndensely sampled, multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns of numerous Seyfert\\ngalaxies have been conducted with the aim of determining the X-ray/UV/optical\\ncontinuum time lags. Time-lag studies can be used to constrain theoretical\\nmodels. The observed time lags can be explained by thermal reprocessing of the\\nX-rays illuminating the accretion disc (known as the X-ray reverberation\\nmodel). However, the observed light curves contain more information that can be\\nused to further constrain physical models. Our primary objective is to\\ninvestigate whether, in addition to time lags, the X-ray reverberation model\\ncan also explain the UV/optical variability amplitude of nearby Seyferts. To do\\nthis, we measured the excess variance of four sources (namely Mrk 509, NGC\\n4151, NGC 2617, and Mrk 142) as a function of wavelength using data from\\narchival long, multi-wavelength campaigns with Swift, and ground-based\\ntelescopes.

We tested the validity of the\\nmodel by comparing the measured and model variances for a range of accretion\\nrates and X-ray source heights. We conclude that the X-ray thermal\\nreverberation model can fit both the continuum, UV/optical time lags, as well\\nas the variance in these AGNs, for the same physical parameters. Our results\\nsuggest that the accretion disc is constant and that all the observed\\nUV/optical variations, on timescales of days and up to a few weeks, can be\\nfully explained by the variable X-rays as they illuminate the accretion disc.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10417v1) |\\n| Local central limit theorem for Mallows measure | Alexey Bufetov, Kailun Chen |   We study the statistics of the Mallows measure on permutations in the limit\\npioneered by Starr (2009).

Drawing parallels from the successful application\\nof Gibrat's law of proportional growth in explaining city size and word\\nfrequency distributions, we tested whether the same principle could account for\\nthe log-normal distribution in Bitcoin balances. However, our calculations\\nrevealed that the exponent parameters in both the drift and variance terms\\ndeviate slightly from one. This suggests that Gibrat's proportional growth rule\\nalone does not fully explain the log-normal distribution observed in Bitcoin\\nusers' balances. During our exploration, we discovered an intriguing\\nphenomenon: Bitcoin users tend to fall into two distinct categories based on\\ntheir behavior, which we refer to as ``poor\\\" and ``wealthy\\\" users. Poor users,\\nwho initially purchase only a small amount of Bitcoin, tend to buy more\\nbitcoins first and then sell out all their holdings gradually over time. The\\ncertainty of selling all their coins is higher and higher with time. In\\ncontrast, wealthy users, who acquire a large amount of Bitcoin from the start,\\ntend to sell off their holdings over time. The speed at which they sell their\\nbitcoins is lower and lower over time and they will hold at least a small part\\nof their initial holdings at last. Interestingly, the wealthier the user, the\\nlarger the proportion of their balance and the higher the certainty they tend\\nto sell. This research provided an interesting perspective to explore bitcoin\\nusers' behaviors which may apply to other finance markets.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10407v1) |\\n| Stochastic Data-Driven Predictive Control: Chance-Constraint\\n  Satisfaction with Identified Multi-step Predictors | Haldun Balim, Andrea Carron, Melanie N.

In meiosis II mouse oocytes (developing egg cells) awaiting\\nfertilisation, the spindle, which is the protein structure responsible for\\ndividing genetic material in a cell, must maintain its position near the cell\\ncortex (the thin actin network bound to the cell membrane) for many hours.\\nHowever, the cytoplasmic streaming that accompanies this stable positioning\\nwould intuitively appear to destabilise the spindle position. Here, through a\\ncombination of numerical and analytical modelling, we reveal a new,\\nhydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning beneath the cortical cap.\\nWe show that this stability depends critically on the spindle size and the\\nactive driving from the cortex, and demonstrate that stable spindle positioning\\ncan result purely from a hydrodynamic suction force exerted on the spindle by\\nthe cytoplasmic flow.

Since it offers a well-motivated starting point for\\nthe study of physics at very high energies, we incorporate an $R^2$ term in the\\nPalatini gravity. In addition, afterward the inflation, the inflaton oscillates\\nabout the minimum of the inflation potential, and reheats the universe. This\\noccurs during the reheating phase, at which the inflaton decays into the\\nstandard model particles, which fill the universe.

The majority of work that has been\\ndone is focused on Deep Learning (DL) based approaches. However, with the\\nemergence of new algorithms such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm, there\\nis growing interest in exploring alternative approaches that may offer unique\\nadvantages in certain domains or applications. One of these domains is\\nFederated Learning (FL), in which users privacy is of utmost importance. Due to\\nits novelty, FL has seen a surge in the incorporation of personalization\\ntechniques to enhance model accuracy while maintaining user privacy under\\npersonalized conditions. In this work, we propose a novel approach dubbed TPFL:\\nTsetlin-Personalized Federated Learning, in which models are grouped into\\nclusters based on their confidence towards a specific class. In this way,\\nclustering can benefit from two key advantages. Firstly, clients share only\\nwhat they are confident about, resulting in the elimination of wrongful weight\\naggregation among clients whose data for a specific class may have not been\\nenough during the training. This phenomenon is prevalent when the data are\\nnon-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID). Secondly, by sharing\\nonly weights towards a specific class, communication cost is substantially\\nreduced, making TPLF efficient in terms of both accuracy and communication\\ncost.

However,\\nsuch fixed feature encoders tend to be class-agnostic, inevitably activating\\nobjects that are irrelevant to the target class. In contrast, humans can\\neffortlessly focus on specific objects in the line of sight. This paper mimics\\nthe visual perception pattern of human beings and proposes a novel and powerful\\nprompt-driven scheme, called ``Prompt and Transfer\\\" (PAT), which constructs a\\ndynamic class-aware prompting paradigm to tune the encoder for focusing on the\\ninterested object (target class) in the current task. Three key points are\\nelaborated to enhance the prompting: 1) Cross-modal linguistic information is\\nintroduced to initialize prompts for each task. 2) Semantic Prompt Transfer\\n(SPT) that precisely transfers the class-specific semantics within the images\\nto prompts. 3) Part Mask Generator (PMG) that works in conjunction with SPT to\\nadaptively generate different but complementary part prompts for different\\nindividuals.

However, this introduces\\nthe complexities of numerical derivatives into the training process of these\\nmodels. In this study, we propose modifying the structure of the traditional\\nRNN to enable the prediction of each block over a time interval, making it\\npossible to calculate the derivative of the output with respect to time using\\nthe backpropagation algorithm.

Most of the state-of-the-art architectures\\nuse transformers or diffusion-based models to perform this task, despite the\\nheavy computational burden that they require.

To overcome the above, this paper\\nexplores a novel design of Mamba, an emergent State-Space Model (SSM), called\\nMamba-ST, to perform style transfer. To do so, we adapt Mamba linear equation\\nto simulate the behavior of cross-attention layers, which are able to combine\\ntwo separate embeddings into a single output, but drastically reducing memory\\nusage and time complexity.

Utilizing a combination of tight-binding theory and density functional\\ntheory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on\\nelectronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the\\nelectronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function,\\nwhich significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the\\noverall {\\\\it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT\\ncalculations reveal that $AB$-stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal\\nconductivity compared to $AA$-stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic\\nscattering and phonon group velocity.

This study introduces\\na novel statistical approach, TAR4C, to dissect causal interactions in\\nmultichannel EEG recordings. TAR4C uses the threshold autoregressive model to\\ndescribe the causal interaction between nodes or clusters of nodes in a brain\\nnetwork. The perspective involves testing whether one node, which may represent\\na brain region, can control the dynamics of the other. The node that has such\\nan impact on the other is called a threshold variable and can be classified as\\na causative because its functionality is the leading source operating as an\\ninstantaneous switching mechanism that regulates the time-varying\\nautoregressive structure of the other. This statistical concept is commonly\\nreferred to as threshold non-linearity. Once threshold non-linearity has been\\nverified between a pair of nodes, the subsequent essential facet of TAR\\nmodeling is to assess the predictive ability of the causal node for the current\\nactivity on the other and represent causal interactions in autoregressive\\nterms. This predictive ability is what underlies Granger causality. The TAR4C\\napproach can discover non-linear and time-dependent causal interactions without\\nnegating the G-causality perspective. The efficacy of the proposed approach is\\nexemplified by analyzing the EEG signals recorded during the motor\\nmovement/imagery experiment. The similarities and differences between the\\ncausal interactions manifesting during the execution and the imagery of a given\\nmotor movement are demonstrated by analyzing EEG recordings from multiple\\nsubjects.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10374v1) |\\n| Instigating Cooperation among LLM Agents Using Adaptive Information\\n  Modulation | Qiliang Chen,  Alireza,  Ilami, Nunzio Lore, Babak Heydari |   This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for\\nhuman strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these\\nagents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments.

The described prediction model and\\ngrasping strategy were validated in offline evaluations and online experiments,\\nand the accuracy and generalizability were demonstrated.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10371v1) |\\n| Uncovering the Mechanism of Hepatotoxiciy of PFAS Targeting L-FABP Using\\n  GCN and Computational Modeling | Lucas Jividen, Tibo Duran, Xi-Zhi Niu, Jun Bai |   Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental\\npollutants with known toxicity and bioaccumulation issues. Their widespread\\nindustrial use and resistance to degradation have led to global environmental\\ncontamination and significant health concerns. While a minority of PFAS have\\nbeen extensively studied, the toxicity of many PFAS remains poorly understood\\ndue to limited direct toxicological data. This study advances the predictive\\nmodeling of PFAS toxicity by combining semi-supervised graph convolutional\\nnetworks (GCNs) with molecular descriptors and fingerprints. We propose a novel\\napproach to enhance the prediction of PFAS binding affinities by isolating\\nmolecular fingerprints to construct graphs where then descriptors are set as\\nthe node features. This approach specifically captures the structural,\\nphysicochemical, and topological features of PFAS without overfitting due to an\\nabundance of features. Unsupervised clustering then identifies representative\\ncompounds for detailed binding studies. Our results provide a more accurate\\nability to estimate PFAS hepatotoxicity to provide guidance in chemical\\ndiscovery of new PFAS and the development of new safety regulations.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10370v1) |\\n| Stochastic Control of UAVs: An Optimal Tradeoff between Performance,\\n  Flight Smoothness and Control Effort | George Rapakoulias, Panagiotis Tsiotras |   Safe and accurate control of unmanned aerial vehicles in the presence of\\nwinds is a challenging control problem due to the hard-to-model and highly\\nstochastic nature of the disturbance forces acting upon the vehicle. To meet\\nperformance constraints, state-of-the-art control methods such as Incremental\\nNonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) or other adaptive control techniques require\\nhigh control gains to mitigate the effects of uncertainty entering the system.\\nWhile achieving good tracking performance, IDNI requires excessive control\\neffort, results in high actuator strain, and reduced flight smoothness due to\\nconstant and aggressive corrective actions commanded by the controller. In this\\npaper, we propose a novel control architecture that allows the user to\\nsystematically address the trade-off between high authority control and\\nperformance constraint satisfaction. Our approach consists of two parts. To\\ncancel out biases introduced by unmodelled aerodynamic effects we propose a\\nhybrid, model-based disturbance force estimator augmented with a neural\\nnetwork, that can adapt to external wind conditions using a Kalman Filter. We\\nthen utilize state-of-the-art results from Covariance Steering theory, which\\noffers a principled way of controlling the uncertainty of the tracking error\\ndynamics. We first analyze the properties of the combined system and then\\nprovide extensive experimental results to verify the advantages of the proposed\\napproach over existing methods\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10369v1) |\\n| Integrated nowcasting of convective precipitation with Transformer-based\\n  models using multi-source data | \\u00c7a\\u011flar K\\u00fc\\u00e7\\u00fck, Aitor Atencia, Markus Dabernig |   Precipitation nowcasting is crucial for mitigating the impacts of severe\\nweather events and supporting daily activities. Conventional models\\npredominantly relying on radar data have limited performance in predicting\\ncases with complex temporal features such as convection initiation,\\nhighlighting the need to integrate data from other sources for more\\ncomprehensive nowcasting. Unlike physics-based models, machine learning\\n(ML)-based models offer promising solutions for efficiently integrating large\\nvolumes of diverse data. We present EF4INCA, a spatiotemporal Transformer model\\nfor precipitation nowcasting that integrates satellite- and ground-based\\nobservations with numerical weather prediction outputs. EF4INCA provides\\nhigh-resolution forecasts over Austria, accurately predicting the location and\\nshape of precipitation fields with a spatial resolution of 1 kilometre and a\\ntemporal resolution of 5 minutes, up to 90 minutes ahead. Our evaluation shows\\nthat EF4INCA outperforms conventional nowcasting models, including the\\noperational model of Austria, particularly in scenarios with complex temporal\\nfeatures such as convective initiation and rapid weather changes. EF4INCA\\nmaintains higher accuracy in location forecasting but generates smoother fields\\nat later prediction times compared to traditional models. Interpretation of our\\nmodel showed that precipitation products and SEVIRI infrared channels CH7 and\\nCH9 are the most important data streams. These results underscore the\\nimportance of combining data from different domains, including physics-based\\nmodel products, with ML approaches. Our study highlights the robustness of\\nEF4INCA and its potential for improved precipitation nowcasting. We provide\\naccess to our code repository, model weights, and the dataset curated for\\nbenchmarking, facilitating further development and application.\\n | General | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10367v1) |\\n\\n\"}", "timestamp": "2024-09-17 06:18:20.255873", "thread_id": 139925298559872}
