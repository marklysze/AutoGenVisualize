**Objective:** To find recent papers on Large Language Model (LLM) applications from arXiv in the last week and create a markdown table categorizing them by different domains.

**Steps:**

1. **Search for Papers (Scientist)**
   - The scientist will use arXiv's search functionality to filter papers published in the last week that focus on LLM applications. This will involve using relevant keywords and possibly setting up alerts for new papers.

2. **Data Extraction (Scientist)**
   - The scientist will extract relevant information from the papers, such as title, authors, abstract, and domain of application (e.g., healthcare, education, finance, etc.).

3. **Data Organization (Engineer)**
   - The engineer will create a markdown table format to organize the extracted data. The table will include columns for the title, authors, abstract, and domain.

4. **Data Entry (Engineer)**
   - The engineer will input the extracted data into the markdown table, ensuring that it is well-formatted and easy to read.

5. **Review and Finalization (Scientist & Engineer)**
   - The scientist will review the markdown table for accuracy and completeness, while the engineer will ensure that the formatting is correct.

6. **Submission (Scientist)**
   - The scientist will submit the final markdown table to the admin for approval.

| Gender Representation and Bias in Indian Civil Service Mock Interviews | Somonnoy Banerjee, Sujan Dutta, Soumyajit Datta, Ashiqur R. KhudaBukhsh |   This paper makes three key contributions. First, via a substantial corpus of
51,278 interview questions sourced from 888 YouTube videos of mock interviews
of Indian civil service candidates, we demonstrate stark gender bias in the
broad nature of questions asked to male and female candidates. Second, our
experiments with large language models show a strong presence of gender bias in
explanations provided by the LLMs on the gender inference task. Finally, we
present a novel dataset of 51,278 interview questions that can inform future

| DynaMo: In-Domain Dynamics Pretraining for Visuo-Motor Control | Zichen Jeff Cui, Hengkai Pan, Aadhithya Iyer, Siddhant Haldar, Lerrel Pinto |   Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex
visuomotor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to
thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual
observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual
representations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or
trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present
DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual
representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a
latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of
image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without
augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.
Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet
datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real
environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly
improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised
learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo
hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,
and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and
measure its impact on downstream policy performance. Robot videos are best

models that redefines the conventional predetermined-resolution approach in
visual processing. Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,
which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions
into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to
generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning
with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary
Position Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional
information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for
processing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception
capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL
investigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By
scaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the
amount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive
performance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to
leading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal
benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models. Code is available at

| Bundle Adjustment in the Eager Mode | Zitong Zhan, Huan Xu, Zihang Fang, Xinpeng Wei, Yaoyu Hu, Chen Wang |   Bundle adjustment (BA) is a critical technique in various robotic
applications, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), augmented
reality (AR), and photogrammetry. BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses
and 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance
of deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to
integrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and
performance. However, widely-used C++-based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,
g$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries
like PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of
debugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we
introduce an eager-mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,
providing PyTorch-compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach
includes GPU-accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for
2nd-order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear
solvers. Our eager-mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency,
achieving an average speedup of 18.5$\times$, 22$\times$, and 23$\times$
compared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.

| Massively Multi-Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context | Felix B Mueller, Julian Tanke, Juergen Gall |   Forecasting long-term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of
human behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input
sequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby
people can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene-aware social
transformer model (SAST) to forecast long-term (10s) human motion motion.
Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely
varying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal
convolutional encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer-based bottleneck
that allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model
the conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We
benchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to
16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously. Our model
outperforms other approaches in terms of realism and diversity on different
metrics and in a user study. Code is available at
https://github.com/felixbmuller/SAST.

| SPECTER: An Instrument Concept for CMB Spectral Distortion Measurements
  with Enhanced Sensitivity | Alina Sabyr, Carlos Sierra, J. Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon |   Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a
perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from
fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\mu$-distortion) to late-time
baryonic feedback processes (y-distortion). While the y-distortion can be
detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude
smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a
serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\mu$
arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the
primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here,
we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly
detecting $\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but
with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we
optimize the instrument's configuration to target $\mu$ while robustly
marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike
Fourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their
individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing
significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion at $\approx 5\sigma$ (10$\sigma$)
assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission
duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized
configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular
resolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally
measure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic
correction at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total
thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.

| Exoplanet accretion monitoring spectroscopic survey (ENTROPY) I.
  Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary-mass
  object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C. Ringqvist, Dorian Demars, Markus Janson, Mickaël Bonnefoy, Yuhiko Aoyama, Gabriel-Dominique Marleau, Catherine Dougados, Judit Szulágyi, Thanawuth Thanathibodee |   Accretion among planets is a poorly understood phenomenon, due to lack of
both observational and theoretical studies. Detection of emission lines from
accreting gas giants facilitate detailed investigations into this process. This
work presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known
young, planetary-mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf
2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7-21 Mj and age 5-45 Myr, located at 45+-2
pc. We obtained the first high-resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target
with VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near-UV to visible wavelengths (3200-6800
AA). We report resolved H3-H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.
Based on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+-1
km/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR
excess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of
the parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+-63 K and radius to 1.5+-0.1
Rj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet-surface shock model
implies a pre-shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,-40) km/s and a pre-shock
density of log(n0/cm^-3)=14(+0,-5). Pre-shock velocity points to a mass of
6(+8,-4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary
Lline-Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of

Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B. As a code-specific model,
Qwen2.5-Coder is built upon the Qwen2.5 architecture and continues pretrained
on a vast corpus of over 5.5 trillion tokens. Through meticulous data cleaning,
scalable synthetic data generation, and balanced data mixing, Qwen2.5-Coder
demonstrates impressive code generation capabilities while retaining general
versatility. The model has been evaluated on a wide range of code-related
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across more than 10
benchmarks, including code generation, completion, reasoning, and repair,
consistently outperforming larger models of the same model size. We believe
that the release of the Qwen2.5-Coder series will not only push the boundaries
of research in code intelligence but also, through its permissive licensing,
encourage broader adoption by developers in real-world applications.

Santa-Maria, H. A. Smith, Y. Sofue, M. C. Sormani, V. Tolls, D. L. Walker, Q. D. Wang, G. M. Williams, F. -W. Xu |   The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our
local solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions
it exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong
dynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).
Consequently, it is likely that there are large-scale physical structures
within the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we
present new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a
multi-wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the
M0.8$-$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring-like morphology. We
estimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring to be 79\"
and 154\", respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre
distance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $> 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, a
mass of $\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\odot$, and an expansion speed of $\sim$ 20 km
s$^{-1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($> 10^{51}$ erg) and
momentum ($> 10^7$ M$_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$). We discuss several possible causes
for the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback
and large-scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the
M0.8$-$0.2 ring is a single high-energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain
the observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have
taken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which
we now see as the M0.8$-$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an
extreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.

| To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic
  reasoning | Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett |   Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of
tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted
a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own
evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives
strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with
much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the
answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the
question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic
operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of
CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing
against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic
execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our
results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance
while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond
prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation
across the whole range of LLM applications.

| DynaMo: In-Domain Dynamics Pretraining for Visuo-Motor Control | Zichen Jeff Cui, Hengkai Pan, Aadhithya Iyer, Siddhant Haldar, Lerrel Pinto |   Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex
visuomotor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to
thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual
observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual
representations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or
trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present
DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual
representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a
latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of
image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without
augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.
Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet
datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real
environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly
improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised
learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo
hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,
and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and
measure its impact on downstream policy performance. Robot videos are best

models that redefines the conventional predetermined-resolution approach in
visual processing. Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,
which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions
into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to
generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning
with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary
Position Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional
information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for
processing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception
capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL
investigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By
scaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the
amount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive
performance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to

| Bundle Adjustment in the Eager Mode | Zitong Zhan, Huan Xu, Zihang Fang, Xinpeng Wei, Yaoyu Hu, Chen Wang |   Bundle adjustment (BA) is a critical technique in various robotic
applications, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), augmented
reality (AR), and photogrammetry. BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses
and 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance
of deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to
integrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and
performance. However, widely-used C++-based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,
g$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries
like PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of
debugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we
introduce an eager-mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,
providing PyTorch-compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach
includes GPU-accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for
2nd-order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear
solvers. Our eager-mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency,
achieving an average speedup of 18.5$\times$, 22$\times$, and 23$\times$
compared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.

| Massively Multi-Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context | Felix B Mueller, Julian Tanke, Juergen Gall |   Forecasting long-term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of
human behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input
sequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby
people can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene-aware social
transformer model (SAST) to forecast long-term (10s) human motion motion.
Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely
varying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal
convolutional encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer-based bottleneck
that allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model
the conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We
benchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to
16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously. Our model
outperforms other approaches in terms of realism and diversity on different
metrics and in a user study. Code is available at

| SPECTER: An Instrument Concept for CMB Spectral Distortion Measurements
  with Enhanced Sensitivity | Alina Sabyr, Carlos Sierra, J. Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon |   Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a
perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from
fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\mu$-distortion) to late-time
baryonic feedback processes (y-distortion). While the y-distortion can be
detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude
smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a
serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\mu$
arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the
primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here,
we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly
detecting $\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but
with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we
optimize the instrument's configuration to target $\mu$ while robustly
marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike
Fourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their
individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing
significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion at $\approx 5\sigma$ (10$\sigma$)
assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission
duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized
configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular
resolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally
measure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic
correction at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total
thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.

Ringqvist, Dorian Demars, Markus Janson, Mickaël Bonnefoy, Yuhiko Aoyama, Gabriel-Dominique Marleau, Catherine Dougados, Judit Szulágyi, Thanawuth Thanathibodee |   Accretion among planets is a poorly understood phenomenon, due to lack of
both observational and theoretical studies. Detection of emission lines from
accreting gas giants facilitate detailed investigations into this process. This
work presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known
young, planetary-mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf
2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7-21 Mj and age 5-45 Myr, located at 45+-2
pc. We obtained the first high-resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target
with VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near-UV to visible wavelengths (3200-6800
AA). We report resolved H3-H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.
Based on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+-1
km/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR
excess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of
the parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+-63 K and radius to 1.5+-0.1
Rj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet-surface shock model
implies a pre-shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,-40) km/s and a pre-shock
density of log(n0/cm^-3)=14(+0,-5). Pre-shock velocity points to a mass of
6(+8,-4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary
Lline-Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of
1.4(+2.8,-0.9)x10^-8 Mj/yr.

  with Enhanced Sensitivity | Alina Sabyr, Carlos Sierra, J. Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon |   Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a
perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from
fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\mu$-distortion) to late-time
baryonic feedback processes (y-distortion). While the y-distortion can be
detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude
smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a
serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\mu$
arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the
primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here,
we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly
detecting $\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but
with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we
optimize the instrument's configuration to target $\mu$ while robustly
marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike
Fourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their
individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing
significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion at $\approx 5\sigma$ (10$\sigma$)
assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission
duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized
configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular
resolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally
measure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic
correction at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total
thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.

  Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary-mass
  object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C. Ringqvist, Dorian Demars, Markus Janson, Mickaël Bonnefoy, Yuhiko Aoyama, Gabriel-Dominique Marleau, Catherine Dougados, Judit Szulágyi, Thanawuth Thanathibodee |   Accretion among planets is a poorly understood phenomenon, due to lack of
both observational and theoretical studies. Detection of emission lines from
accreting gas giants facilitate detailed investigations into this process. This
work presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known
young, planetary-mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf
2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7-21 Mj and age 5-45 Myr, located at 45+-2
pc. We obtained the first high-resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target
with VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near-UV to visible wavelengths (3200-6800
AA). We report resolved H3-H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.
Based on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+-1
km/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR
excess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of
the parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+-63 K and radius to 1.5+-0.1
Rj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet-surface shock model
implies a pre-shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,-40) km/s and a pre-shock
density of log(n0/cm^-3)=14(+0,-5). Pre-shock velocity points to a mass of
6(+8,-4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary
Lline-Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of
1.4(+2.8,-0.9)x10^-8 Mj/yr.

from its predecessor, CodeQwen1.5. This series includes two models:
Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B. As a code-specific model,
Qwen2.5-Coder is built upon the Qwen2.5 architecture and continues pretrained
on a vast corpus of over 5.5 trillion tokens. Through meticulous data cleaning,
scalable synthetic data generation, and balanced data mixing, Qwen2.5-Coder
demonstrates impressive code generation capabilities while retaining general
versatility. The model has been evaluated on a wide range of code-related
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across more than 10
benchmarks, including code generation, completion, reasoning, and repair,
consistently outperforming larger models of the same model size. We believe
that the release of the Qwen2.5-Coder series will not only push the boundaries
of research in code intelligence but also, through its permissive licensing,
encourage broader adoption by developers in real-world applications.

Santa-Maria, H. A. Smith, Y. Sofue, M. C. Sormani, V. Tolls, D. L. Walker, Q. D. Wang, G. M. Williams, F. -W. Xu |   The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our
local solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions
it exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong
dynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).
Consequently, it is likely that there are large-scale physical structures
within the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we
present new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a
multi-wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the
M0.8$-$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring-like morphology. We
estimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring to be 79\"
and 154\", respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre
distance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $> 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, a
mass of $\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\odot$, and an expansion speed of $\sim$ 20 km
s$^{-1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($> 10^{51}$ erg) and
momentum ($> 10^7$ M$_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$). We discuss several possible causes
for the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback
and large-scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the
M0.8$-$0.2 ring is a single high-energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain
the observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have
taken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which
we now see as the M0.8$-$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an
extreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.

| To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic
  reasoning | Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett |   Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of
tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted
a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own
evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives
strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with
much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the
answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the
question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic
operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of
CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing
against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic
execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our
results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance
while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond
prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation
across the whole range of LLM applications.

| DynaMo: In-Domain Dynamics Pretraining for Visuo-Motor Control | Zichen Jeff Cui, Hengkai Pan, Aadhithya Iyer, Siddhant Haldar, Lerrel Pinto |   Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex
visuomotor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to
thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual
observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual
representations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or
trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present
DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual
representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a
latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of
image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without
augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.
Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet
datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real
environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly
improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised
learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo
hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,
and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and
measure its impact on downstream policy performance. Robot videos are best

models that redefines the conventional predetermined-resolution approach in
visual processing. Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,
which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions
into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to
generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning
with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary
Position Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional
information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for
processing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception
capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL
investigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By
scaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the
amount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive
performance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to
leading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal
benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models. Code is available at

| Bundle Adjustment in the Eager Mode | Zitong Zhan, Huan Xu, Zihang Fang, Xinpeng Wei, Yaoyu Hu, Chen Wang |   Bundle adjustment (BA) is a critical technique in various robotic
applications, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), augmented
reality (AR), and photogrammetry. BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses
and 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance
of deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to
integrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and
performance. However, widely-used C++-based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,
g$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries
like PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of
debugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we
introduce an eager-mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,
providing PyTorch-compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach
includes GPU-accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for
2nd-order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear
solvers. Our eager-mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency,
achieving an average speedup of 18.5$\times$, 22$\times$, and 23$\times$
compared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.

| Massively Multi-Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context | Felix B Mueller, Julian Tanke, Juergen Gall |   Forecasting long-term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of
human behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input
sequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby
people can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene-aware social
transformer model (SAST) to forecast long-term (10s) human motion motion.
Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely
varying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal
convolutional encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer-based bottleneck
that allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model
the conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We
benchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to
16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously. Our model
outperforms other approaches in terms of realism and diversity on different
metrics and in a user study. Code is available at

visual processing. Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,
which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions
into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to
generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning
with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary
Position Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional
information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for
processing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception
capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL
investigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By
scaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the
amount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive
performance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to
leading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal
benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models. Code is available at

| Bundle Adjustment in the Eager Mode | Zitong Zhan, Huan Xu, Zihang Fang, Xinpeng Wei, Yaoyu Hu, Chen Wang |   Bundle adjustment (BA) is a critical technique in various robotic
applications, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), augmented
reality (AR), and photogrammetry. BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses
and 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance
of deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to
integrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and
performance. However, widely-used C++-based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,
g$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries
like PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of
debugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we
introduce an eager-mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,
providing PyTorch-compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach
includes GPU-accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for
2nd-order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear
solvers. Our eager-mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency,
achieving an average speedup of 18.5$\times$, 22$\times$, and 23$\times$
compared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.

| Massively Multi-Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context | Felix B Mueller, Julian Tanke, Juergen Gall |   Forecasting long-term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of
human behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input
sequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby
people can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene-aware social
transformer model (SAST) to forecast long-term (10s) human motion motion.
Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely
varying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal
convolutional encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer-based bottleneck
that allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model
the conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We
benchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to
16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously. Our model
outperforms other approaches in terms of realism and diversity on different
metrics and in a user study. Code is available at

| SPECTER: An Instrument Concept for CMB Spectral Distortion Measurements
  with Enhanced Sensitivity | Alina Sabyr, Carlos Sierra, J. Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon |   Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a
perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from
fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\mu$-distortion) to late-time
baryonic feedback processes (y-distortion). While the y-distortion can be
detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude
smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a
serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\mu$
arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the
primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here,
we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly
detecting $\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but
with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we
optimize the instrument's configuration to target $\mu$ while robustly
marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike
Fourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their
individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing
significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion at $\approx 5\sigma$ (10$\sigma$)
assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission
duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized
configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular
resolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally
measure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic
correction at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total
thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.

  Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary-mass

Ringqvist, Dorian Demars, Markus Janson, Mickaël Bonnefoy, Yuhiko Aoyama, Gabriel-Dominique Marleau, Catherine Dougados, Judit Szulágyi, Thanawuth Thanathibodee |   Accretion among planets is a poorly understood phenomenon, due to lack of
both observational and theoretical studies. Detection of emission lines from
accreting gas giants facilitate detailed investigations into this process. This
work presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known
young, planetary-mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf
2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7-21 Mj and age 5-45 Myr, located at 45+-2
pc. We obtained the first high-resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target
with VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near-UV to visible wavelengths (3200-6800
AA). We report resolved H3-H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.
Based on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+-1
km/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR
excess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of
the parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+-63 K and radius to 1.5+-0.1
Rj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet-surface shock model
implies a pre-shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,-40) km/s and a pre-shock
density of log(n0/cm^-3)=14(+0,-5). Pre-shock velocity points to a mass of
6(+8,-4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary
Lline-Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of
1.4(+2.8,-0.9)x10^-8 Mj/yr.

from its predecessor, CodeQwen1.5. This series includes two models:
Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B. As a code-specific model,
Qwen2.5-Coder is built upon the Qwen2.5 architecture and continues pretrained
on a vast corpus of over 5.5 trillion tokens. Through meticulous data cleaning,
scalable synthetic data generation, and balanced data mixing, Qwen2.5-Coder
demonstrates impressive code generation capabilities while retaining general
versatility. The model has been evaluated on a wide range of code-related
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across more than 10
benchmarks, including code generation, completion, reasoning, and repair,
consistently outperforming larger models of the same model size. We believe
that the release of the Qwen2.5-Coder series will not only push the boundaries
of research in code intelligence but also, through its permissive licensing,
encourage broader adoption by developers in real-world applications.

Santa-Maria, H. A. Smith, Y. Sofue, M. C. Sormani, V. Tolls, D. L. Walker, Q. D. Wang, G. M. Williams, F. -W. Xu |   The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our
local solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions
it exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong
dynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).
Consequently, it is likely that there are large-scale physical structures
within the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we
present new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a
multi-wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the
M0.8$-$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring-like morphology. We
estimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring to be 79\"
and 154\", respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre
distance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $> 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, a
mass of $\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\odot$, and an expansion speed of $\sim$ 20 km
s$^{-1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($> 10^{51}$ erg) and
momentum ($> 10^7$ M$_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$). We discuss several possible causes
for the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback
and large-scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the
M0.8$-$0.2 ring is a single high-energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain
the observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have
taken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which
we now see as the M0.8$-$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an
extreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.

| To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic
  reasoning | Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett |   Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of
tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted
a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own
evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives
strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with
much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the
answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the
question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic
operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of
CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing
against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic
execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our
results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance
while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond
prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation
across the whole range of LLM applications.

| DynaMo: In-Domain Dynamics Pretraining for Visuo-Motor Control | Zichen Jeff Cui, Hengkai Pan, Aadhithya Iyer, Siddhant Haldar, Lerrel Pinto |   Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex
visuomotor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to
thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual
observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual
representations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or
trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present
DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual
representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a
latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of
image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without
augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.
Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet
datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real
environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly
improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised
learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo
hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,
and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and
measure its impact on downstream policy performance. Robot videos are best

prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation
across the whole range of LLM applications.

| Gender Representation and Bias in Indian Civil Service Mock Interviews | Somonnoy Banerjee, Sujan Dutta, Soumyajit Datta, Ashiqur R. KhudaBukhsh |   This paper makes three key contributions. First, via a substantial corpus of
51,278 interview questions sourced from 888 YouTube videos of mock interviews
of Indian civil service candidates, we demonstrate stark gender bias in the
broad nature of questions asked to male and female candidates. Second, our
experiments with large language models show a strong presence of gender bias in
explanations provided by the LLMs on the gender inference task. Finally, we
present a novel dataset of 51,278 interview questions that can inform future
social science studies.

| DynaMo: In-Domain Dynamics Pretraining for Visuo-Motor Control | Zichen Jeff Cui, Hengkai Pan, Aadhithya Iyer, Siddhant Haldar, Lerrel Pinto |   Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex
visuomotor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to
thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual
observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual
representations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or
trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present
DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual
representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a
latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of
image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without
augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.
Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet
datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real
environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly
improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised
learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo
hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,
and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and
measure its impact on downstream policy performance. Robot videos are best

| Qwen2-VL: Enhancing Vision-Language Model's Perception of the World at
  Any Resolution | Peng Wang, Shuai Bai, Sinan Tan, Shijie Wang, Zhihao Fan, Jinze Bai, Keqin Chen, Xuejing Liu, Jialin Wang, Wenbin Ge, Yang Fan, Kai Dang, Mengfei Du, Xuancheng Ren, Rui Men, Dayiheng Liu, Chang Zhou, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin |   We present the Qwen2-VL Series, an advanced upgrade of the previous Qwen-VL
models that redefines the conventional predetermined-resolution approach in
visual processing. Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,
which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions
into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to
generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning
with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary
Position Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional
information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for
processing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception
capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL
investigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By
scaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the
amount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive
performance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to
leading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal
benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models. Code is available at

| Bundle Adjustment in the Eager Mode | Zitong Zhan, Huan Xu, Zihang Fang, Xinpeng Wei, Yaoyu Hu, Chen Wang |   Bundle adjustment (BA) is a critical technique in various robotic
applications, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), augmented
reality (AR), and photogrammetry. BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses
and 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance
of deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to
integrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and
performance. However, widely-used C++-based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,
g$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries
like PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of
debugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we
introduce an eager-mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,
providing PyTorch-compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach
includes GPU-accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for
2nd-order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear
solvers. Our eager-mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency,
achieving an average speedup of 18.5$\times$, 22$\times$, and 23$\times$
compared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.

| Massively Multi-Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context | Felix B Mueller, Julian Tanke, Juergen Gall |   Forecasting long-term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of
human behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input
sequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby
people can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene-aware social
transformer model (SAST) to forecast long-term (10s) human motion motion.
Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely
varying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal
convolutional encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer-based bottleneck
that allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model
the conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We
benchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to
16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously. Our model
outperforms other approaches in terms of realism and diversity on different
metrics and in a user study. Code is available at
https://github.com/felixbmuller/SAST.

| SPECTER: An Instrument Concept for CMB Spectral Distortion Measurements
  with Enhanced Sensitivity | Alina Sabyr, Carlos Sierra, J. Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon |   Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a
perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from
fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\mu$-distortion) to late-time
baryonic feedback processes (y-distortion). While the y-distortion can be
detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude
smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a
serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\mu$
arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the
primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here,
we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly
detecting $\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but
with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we
optimize the instrument's configuration to target $\mu$ while robustly
marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike
Fourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their
individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing
significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion at $\approx 5\sigma$ (10$\sigma$)
assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission
duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized
configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular
resolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally
measure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic
correction at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total
thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.

| Exoplanet accretion monitoring spectroscopic survey (ENTROPY) I.
  Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary-mass
  object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C. Ringqvist, Dorian Demars, Markus Janson, Mickaël Bonnefoy, Yuhiko Aoyama, Gabriel-Dominique Marleau, Catherine Dougados, Judit Szulágyi, Thanawuth Thanathibodee |   Accretion among planets is a poorly understood phenomenon, due to lack of
both observational and theoretical studies. Detection of emission lines from
accreting gas giants facilitate detailed investigations into this process. This
work presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known
young, planetary-mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf
2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7-21 Mj and age 5-45 Myr, located at 45+-2
pc. We obtained the first high-resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target
with VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near-UV to visible wavelengths (3200-6800
AA). We report resolved H3-H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.
Based on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+-1
km/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR
excess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of
the parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+-63 K and radius to 1.5+-0.1
Rj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet-surface shock model
implies a pre-shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,-40) km/s and a pre-shock
density of log(n0/cm^-3)=14(+0,-5). Pre-shock velocity points to a mass of
6(+8,-4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary
Lline-Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of
1.4(+2.8,-0.9)x10^-8 Mj/yr.

| Qwen2.5-Coder Technical Report | Binyuan Hui, Jian Yang, Zeyu Cui, Jiaxi Yang, Dayiheng Liu, Lei Zhang, Tianyu Liu, Jiajun Zhang, Bowen Yu, Kai Dang, An Yang, Rui Men, Fei Huang, Xingzhang Ren, Xuancheng Ren, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin |   In this report, we introduce the Qwen2.5-Coder series, a significant upgrade
from its predecessor, CodeQwen1.5. This series includes two models:
Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B. As a code-specific model,
Qwen2.5-Coder is built upon the Qwen2.5 architecture and continues pretrained
on a vast corpus of over 5.5 trillion tokens. Through meticulous data cleaning,
scalable synthetic data generation, and balanced data mixing, Qwen2.5-Coder
demonstrates impressive code generation capabilities while retaining general
versatility. The model has been evaluated on a wide range of code-related
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across more than 10
benchmarks, including code generation, completion, reasoning, and repair,
consistently outperforming larger models of the same model size. We believe
that the release of the Qwen2.5-Coder series will not only push the boundaries
of research in code intelligence but also, through its permissive licensing,
encourage broader adoption by developers in real-world applications.

| Disruption of a massive molecular cloud by a supernova in the Galactic
  Centre: Initial results from the ACES project | M. Nonhebel, A. T. Barnes, K. Immer, J. Armijos-Abendaño, J. Bally, C. Battersby, M. G. Burton, N. Butterfield, L. Colzi, P. García, A. Ginsburg, J.

Santa-Maria, H. A. Smith, Y. Sofue, M. C. Sormani, V. Tolls, D. L. Walker, Q. D. Wang, G. M. Williams, F. -W. Xu |   The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our
local solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions
it exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong
dynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).
Consequently, it is likely that there are large-scale physical structures
within the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we
present new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a
multi-wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the
M0.8$-$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring-like morphology. We
estimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring to be 79\"
and 154\", respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre
distance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $> 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, a
mass of $\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\odot$, and an expansion speed of $\sim$ 20 km
s$^{-1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($> 10^{51}$ erg) and
momentum ($> 10^7$ M$_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$). We discuss several possible causes
for the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback
and large-scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the
M0.8$-$0.2 ring is a single high-energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain
the observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have
taken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which
we now see as the M0.8$-$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an
extreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.

| To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic
  reasoning | Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett |   Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of
tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted
a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own
evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives
strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with
much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the
answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the
question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic
operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of
CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing
against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic
execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our
results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance
while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond
prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation
across the whole range of LLM applications.
