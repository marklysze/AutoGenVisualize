**Objective:** To find recent papers on Large Language Model (LLM) applications from arXiv in the last week and create a markdown table categorizing them by different domains.

**Steps:**

1. **Search for Papers (Scientist)**
   - The scientist will use arXiv's search functionality to filter papers published in the last week that focus on LLM applications. This will involve using relevant keywords and possibly setting up alerts for new papers.

2. **Data Extraction (Scientist)**
   - The scientist will extract relevant information from the papers, such as title, authors, abstract, and domain of application (e.g., healthcare, education, finance, etc.).

3. **Data Organization (Engineer)**
   - The engineer will create a markdown table format to organize the extracted data. The table will include columns for the title, authors, abstract, and domain.

4. **Data Entry (Engineer)**
   - The engineer will input the extracted data into the markdown table, ensuring that it is well-formatted and easy to read.

5. **Review and Finalization (Scientist & Engineer)**
   - The scientist will review the markdown table for accuracy and completeness, while the engineer will ensure that the formatting is correct.

6. **Submission (Scientist)**
   - The scientist will submit the final markdown table to the admin for approval.

| Gender Representation and Bias in Indian Civil Service Mock Interviews | Somonnoy Banerjee, Sujan Dutta, Soumyajit Datta, Ashiqur R. KhudaBukhsh |   This paper makes three key contributions. First, via a substantial corpus of
51,278 interview questions sourced from 888 YouTube videos of mock interviews
of Indian civil service candidates, we demonstrate stark gender bias in the
broad nature of questions asked to male and female candidates. Second, our
experiments with large language models show a strong presence of gender bias in
explanations provided by the LLMs on the gender inference task. Finally, we
present a novel dataset of 51,278 interview questions that can inform future
social science studies.

| DynaMo: In-Domain Dynamics Pretraining for Visuo-Motor Control | Zichen Jeff Cui, Hengkai Pan, Aadhithya Iyer, Siddhant Haldar, Lerrel Pinto |   Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex
visuomotor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to
thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual
observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual
representations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or
trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present
DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual
representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a
latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of
image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without
augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.
Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet
datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real
environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly
improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised
learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo
hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,
and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and
measure its impact on downstream policy performance. Robot videos are best

models that redefines the conventional predetermined-resolution approach in
visual processing. Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,
which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions
into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to
generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning
with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary
Position Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional
information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for
processing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception
capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL
investigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By
scaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the
amount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive
performance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to
leading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal
benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models. Code is available at

| Bundle Adjustment in the Eager Mode | Zitong Zhan, Huan Xu, Zihang Fang, Xinpeng Wei, Yaoyu Hu, Chen Wang |   Bundle adjustment (BA) is a critical technique in various robotic
applications, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), augmented
reality (AR), and photogrammetry. BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses
and 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance
of deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to
integrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and
performance. However, widely-used C++-based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,
g$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries
like PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of
debugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we
introduce an eager-mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,
providing PyTorch-compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach
includes GPU-accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for
2nd-order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear
solvers. Our eager-mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency,
achieving an average speedup of 18.5$\times$, 22$\times$, and 23$\times$
compared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.

| Massively Multi-Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context | Felix B Mueller, Julian Tanke, Juergen Gall |   Forecasting long-term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of
human behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input
sequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby
people can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene-aware social
transformer model (SAST) to forecast long-term (10s) human motion motion.
Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely
varying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal
convolutional encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer-based bottleneck
that allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model
the conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We
benchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to
16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously. Our model
outperforms other approaches in terms of realism and diversity on different
metrics and in a user study. Code is available at
https://github.com/felixbmuller/SAST.

| SPECTER: An Instrument Concept for CMB Spectral Distortion Measurements
  with Enhanced Sensitivity | Alina Sabyr, Carlos Sierra, J. Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon |   Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a
perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from
fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\mu$-distortion) to late-time
baryonic feedback processes (y-distortion). While the y-distortion can be
detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude
smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a
serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\mu$
arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the
primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here,
we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly
detecting $\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but
with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we
optimize the instrument's configuration to target $\mu$ while robustly
marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike
Fourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their
individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing
significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion at $\approx 5\sigma$ (10$\sigma$)
assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission
duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized
configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular
resolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally
measure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic
correction at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total
thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.

| Exoplanet accretion monitoring spectroscopic survey (ENTROPY) I.
  Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary-mass
  object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C. Ringqvist, Dorian Demars, Markus Janson, Mickaël Bonnefoy, Yuhiko Aoyama, Gabriel-Dominique Marleau, Catherine Dougados, Judit Szulágyi, Thanawuth Thanathibodee |   Accretion among planets is a poorly understood phenomenon, due to lack of
both observational and theoretical studies. Detection of emission lines from
accreting gas giants facilitate detailed investigations into this process. This
work presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known
young, planetary-mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf
2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7-21 Mj and age 5-45 Myr, located at 45+-2
pc. We obtained the first high-resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target
with VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near-UV to visible wavelengths (3200-6800
AA). We report resolved H3-H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.
Based on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+-1
km/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR
excess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of
the parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+-63 K and radius to 1.5+-0.1
Rj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet-surface shock model
implies a pre-shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,-40) km/s and a pre-shock
density of log(n0/cm^-3)=14(+0,-5). Pre-shock velocity points to a mass of
6(+8,-4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary
Lline-Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of

| Qwen2.5-Coder Technical Report | Binyuan Hui, Jian Yang, Zeyu Cui, Jiaxi Yang, Dayiheng Liu, Lei Zhang, Tianyu Liu, Jiajun Zhang, Bowen Yu, Kai Dang, An Yang, Rui Men, Fei Huang, Xingzhang Ren, Xuancheng Ren, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin |   In this report, we introduce the Qwen2.5-Coder series, a significant upgrade
from its predecessor, CodeQwen1.5. This series includes two models:
Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B. As a code-specific model,
Qwen2.5-Coder is built upon the Qwen2.5 architecture and continues pretrained
on a vast corpus of over 5.5 trillion tokens. Through meticulous data cleaning,
scalable synthetic data generation, and balanced data mixing, Qwen2.5-Coder
demonstrates impressive code generation capabilities while retaining general
versatility. The model has been evaluated on a wide range of code-related
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across more than 10
benchmarks, including code generation, completion, reasoning, and repair,
consistently outperforming larger models of the same model size. We believe
that the release of the Qwen2.5-Coder series will not only push the boundaries
of research in code intelligence but also, through its permissive licensing,
encourage broader adoption by developers in real-world applications.

| Disruption of a massive molecular cloud by a supernova in the Galactic
  Centre: Initial results from the ACES project | M. Nonhebel, A. T. Barnes, K. Immer, J. Armijos-Abendaño, J. Bally, C. Battersby, M. G. Burton, N. Butterfield, L. Colzi, P. García, A. Ginsburg, J.

Santa-Maria, H. A. Smith, Y. Sofue, M. C. Sormani, V. Tolls, D. L. Walker, Q. D. Wang, G. M. Williams, F. -W. Xu |   The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our
local solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions
it exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong
dynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).
Consequently, it is likely that there are large-scale physical structures
within the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we
present new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a
multi-wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the
M0.8$-$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring-like morphology. We
estimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring to be 79\"
and 154\", respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre
distance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $> 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, a
mass of $\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\odot$, and an expansion speed of $\sim$ 20 km
s$^{-1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($> 10^{51}$ erg) and
momentum ($> 10^7$ M$_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$). We discuss several possible causes
for the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback
and large-scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the
M0.8$-$0.2 ring is a single high-energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain
the observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have
taken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which
we now see as the M0.8$-$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an
extreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.

| To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic
  reasoning | Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett |   Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of
tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted
a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own
evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives
strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with
much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the
answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the
question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic
operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of
CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing
against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic
execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our
results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance
while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond
prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation
across the whole range of LLM applications.

| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs | Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T. Chiu, Siyu Ren, Fei Yuan, Wenting Zhao, Zhiyong Wu, Alexander M. Rush |   Broad textual understanding and in-context learning require language models
that utilize full document contexts. Due to the implementation challenges
associated with directly training long-context models, many methods have been
proposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to
differences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these
approaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long-context
performance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a
controlled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation,
utilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several
insights into long-context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of
perplexity as a general-purpose performance indicator even in longer-context
tasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods
systematically underperform across long-context tasks. Finally, we confirm that
exact fine-tuning based methods are generally effective within the range of
their extension, whereas extrapolation remains challenging. All codebases,
models, and checkpoints will be made available open-source, promoting
transparency and facilitating further research in this critical area of AI
development.

| Finetuning Language Models to Emit Linguistic Expressions of Uncertainty | Arslan Chaudhry, Sridhar Thiagarajan, Dilan Gorur |   Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in information-seeking
and decision-making tasks. Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate
information that conflicts with real-world facts, and their persuasive style
can make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result,
end-users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with
the accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all
outputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore
supervised finetuning on uncertainty-augmented predictions as a method to
develop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty.
Specifically, we measure the calibration of pre-trained models and then
fine-tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of
uncertainty. Through experiments on various question-answering datasets, we
demonstrate that LLMs are well-calibrated in assessing their predictions, and
supervised finetuning based on the model's own confidence leads to
well-calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single-claim
answers.

| Computational Dynamical Systems | Jordan Cotler, Semon Rezchikov |   We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite-dimensional
dynamical systems. Building off of previous work, we give definitions for what
it means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine. We then
show that 'chaotic' dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and
'integrable' dynamical systems (more generally, measure-preserving systems)
cannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines can
be robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, we
show that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable
one-dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and
moreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt.
More broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one 'machine' to simulate
another, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low-complexity 'encoders' and
'decoders' to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system
being simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical
system leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity
theory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.

| Poisson approximate likelihood compared to the particle filter | Yize Hao, Aaron A. Abkemeier, Edward L. Ionides |   Filtering algorithms are fundamental for inference on partially observed
stochastic dynamic systems, since they provide access to the likelihood
function and hence enable likelihood-based or Bayesian inference. A novel
Poisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.
(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering
a fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of
partially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL
is the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large
improvement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,
based on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.
(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should
use PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence
also reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a
shortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that
the comparison of log-likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al. (2023) is
flawed because their PAL calculations were carried out using a dataset scaled
differently from the previous study. If PAL and the particle filter are applied
to the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears. On simulations
where the model is correctly specified, the particle filter outperforms PAL.

| You Only Read Once (YORO): Learning to Internalize Database Knowledge
  for Text-to-SQL | Hideo Kobayashi, Wuwei Lan, Peng Shi, Shuaichen Chang, Jiang Guo, Henghui Zhu, Zhiguo Wang, Patrick Ng |   While significant progress has been made on the text-to-SQL task, recent
solutions repeatedly encode the same database schema for every question,
resulting in unnecessary high inference cost and often overlooking crucial
database knowledge. To address these issues, we propose You Only Read Once
(YORO), a novel paradigm that directly internalizes database knowledge into the
parametric knowledge of a text-to-SQL model during training and eliminates the
need for schema encoding during inference. YORO significantly reduces the input
token length by 66%-98%. Despite its shorter inputs, our empirical results
demonstrate YORO's competitive performances with traditional systems on three
benchmarks as well as its significant outperformance on large databases.
Furthermore, YORO excels in handling questions with challenging value
retrievals such as abbreviation.

| Ergodic properties of infinite extension of symmetric interval exchange
  transformations | Przemysław Berk, Frank Trujillo, Hao Wu |   We prove that skew products with the cocycle given by the function
$f(x)=a(x-1/2)$ with $a\neq 0$ are ergodic for every ergodic symmetric IET in
the base, thus giving the full characterization of ergodic extensions in this
family. Moreover, we prove that under an additional natural assumption of
unique ergodicity on the IET, we can replace $f$ with any differentiable
function with a non-zero sum of jumps. Finally, by considering weakly mixing
IETs instead of just ergodic, we show that the skew products with cocycle given
by $f$ have infinite ergodic index.

| multiPI-TransBTS: A Multi-Path Learning Framework for Brain Tumor Image
  Segmentation Based on Multi-Physical Information | Hongjun Zhu, Jiaohang Huang, Kuo Chen, Xuehui Ying, Ying Qian |   Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis,
treatment planning, and monitoring the progression of brain tumors. However,
due to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across
different MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In
this study, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework, multiPI-TransBTS,
which integrates multi-physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.
The model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi-modal
imaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor
characteristics. The multiPI-TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an
Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi-source, multi-scale feature
decoder. The encoder incorporates a multi-branch architecture to separately
extract modality-specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module
fuses information from multiple sources using channel-wise and element-wise
attention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both
common and task-specific features through a Task-Specific Feature Introduction
(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),
Tumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on
the BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of
multiPI-TransBTS over the state-of-the-art methods. The model consistently
achieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,
highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results
also indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision
and recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a
significant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving
clinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.

| Synchrotron self-Compton in a radiative-adiabatic fireball scenario:
  Modelling the multiwavelength observations in some Fermi/LAT bursts | Nissim Fraija, P. Veres, B. Betancourt Kamenetskaia, A. Galvan-Gamez, M. G. Dainotti, Simone Dichiara, R. L. Becerra |   Energetic GeV photons expected from the closest and the most energetic
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provide an unique opportunity to study the
very-high-energy emission as well as the possible correlations with lower
energy bands in realistic GRB afterglow models. In the standard GRB afterglow
model, the relativistic homogeneous shock is usually considered to be fully
adiabatic, however, it could be partially radiative. Based on the external
forward-shock scenario in both stellar wind and constant-density medium. We
present a radiative-adiabatic analytical model of the synchrotron self-Compton
(SSC) and synchrotron processes considering an electron energy distribution
with a power-law index of 1 < p < 2 and 2 $\leq$ p. We show that the SSC
scenario plays a relevant role in the radiative parameter $\epsilon$, leading
to a prolonged evolution during the slow cooling regime. In a particular case,
we derive the Fermi/LAT light curves together with the photons with energies
$\geq$ 100 MeV in a sample of nine bursts from the second Fermi/LAT GRB catalog
that exhibited temporal and spectral indices with $\geq$ 1.5 and $\approx$ 2,
respectively. These events can hardly be described with closure relations of
the standard synchrotron afterglow model, and also exhibit energetic photons
above the synchrotron limit. We have modeled the multi-wavelength observations
of our sample to constrain the microphysical parameters, the circumburst
density, the bulk Lorentz factor and the mechanism responsible for explaining
the energetic GeV photons.

| Blind Deconvolution on Graphs: Exact and Stable Recovery | Chang Ye, Gonzalo Mateos |   We study a blind deconvolution problem on graphs, which arises in the context
of localizing a few sources that diffuse over networks. While the observations
are bilinear functions of the unknown graph filter coefficients and sparse
input signals, a mild requirement on invertibility of the diffusion filter
enables an efficient convex relaxation leading to a linear programming
formulation that can be tackled with off-the-shelf solvers. Under the
Bernoulli-Gaussian model for the inputs, we derive sufficient exact recovery
conditions in the noise-free setting. A stable recovery result is then
established, ensuring the estimation error remains manageable even when the
observations are corrupted by a small amount of noise. Numerical tests with
synthetic and real-world network data illustrate the merits of the proposed
algorithm, its robustness to noise as well as the benefits of leveraging
multiple signals to aid the (blind) localization of sources of diffusion. At a
fundamental level, the results presented here broaden the scope of classical
blind deconvolution of (spatio-)temporal signals to irregular graph domains.

| Generalized compression and compressive search of large datasets | Morgan E. Prior, Thomas Howard III, Emily Light, Najib Ishaq, Noah M. Daniels |   The Big Data explosion has necessitated the development of search algorithms
that scale sub-linearly in time and memory.
  While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently,
few algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain-specific.
  We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to
perform $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search on compressed data while only decompressing
a small, relevant, portion of the data.
  panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low-dimensional
structure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.
  panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between
two points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in
terms of the other.
  This property holds for many widely-used distance functions, e.g. string edit
distances (Levenshtein, Needleman-Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures
(Jaccard, Dice, etc.).
  We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic,
and set data.
  We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the
compressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.
  panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering
sub-linear time performance for $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search.
  We conclude that panCAKES is an efficient, general-purpose algorithm for
exact compressive search on large datasets that obey the manifold hypothesis.
  We provide an open-source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming
language.

| WeHelp: A Shared Autonomy System for Wheelchair Users | Abulikemu Abuduweili, Alice Wu, Tianhao Wei, Weiye Zhao |   There is a large population of wheelchair users. Most of the wheelchair users
need help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs
are not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this
project, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair
users. A robot with a WeHelp system has three modes, following mode, remote
control mode and tele-operation mode. In the following mode, the robot follows
the wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can
ask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the
wheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech
recognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode.
In the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy
stick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs,
such as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high
shelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant
takes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks
for their needs. Our evaluation shows that the pipeline is useful and practical
for wheelchair users. Source code and demo of the paper are available at

| Identifying inflated Fermi surfaces via thermoelectric response in
  $d$-wave superconductor heterostructure | Amartya Pal, Paramita Dutta, Arijit Saha |   We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric response of inflated Fermi
surfaces (IFSs) generated in a two dimensional unconventional $d$-wave
superconductor subjected to an external in-plane Zeeman field. These IFSs
exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are
topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the
Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave
superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients
including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and
examine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage
and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of
$d$-wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the
normal-superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric
response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in
Seebeck coefficient ($\sim 200\,\mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($\sim 3.5$) due to the
generation of the IFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for
device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by
computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice-regularized
version of our continuum model.

| JEAN: Joint Expression and Audio-guided NeRF-based Talking Face
  Generation | Sai Tanmay Reddy Chakkera, Aggelina Chatziagapi, Dimitris Samaras |   We introduce a novel method for joint expression and audio-guided talking
face generation. Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker
identity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these
challenges, we propose a NeRF-based network. Since we train our network on
monocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn
disentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio
features in a self-supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects.
By incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned
audio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle
motion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer-based architecture
that learns expression features, capturing long-range facial expressions and
disentangling them from the speech-specific mouth movements. Through
quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-fidelity talking face videos, achieving state-of-the-art facial
expression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.

| Autopet III challenge: Incorporating anatomical knowledge into nnUNet
  for lesion segmentation in PET/CT | Hamza Kalisch, Fabian Hörst, Ken Herrmann, Jens Kleesiek, Constantin Seibold |   Lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging is essential for precise tumor
characterization, which supports personalized treatment planning and enhances
diagnostic precision in oncology. However, accurate manual segmentation of
lesions is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. Given the
rising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods,
particularly deep-learning-based approaches, have become increasingly more
relevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation
of tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting,
addressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable
solutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET
challenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers
(FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers. To this extent, we developed a
classifier that identifies the tracer of the given PET/CT based on the Maximum
Intensity Projection of the PET scan. We trained two individual
nnUNet-ensembles for each tracer where anatomical labels are included as a
multi-label task to enhance the model's performance. Our final submission
achieves cross-validation Dice scores of 76.90% and 61.33% for the publicly
available FDG and PSMA datasets, respectively. The code is available at

| Robots that Learn to Safely Influence via Prediction-Informed
  Reach-Avoid Dynamic Games | Ravi Pandya, Changliu Liu, Andrea Bajcsy |   Robots can influence people to accomplish their tasks more efficiently:
autonomous cars can inch forward at an intersection to pass through, and
tabletop manipulators can go for an object on the table first. However, a
robot's ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if
naively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach-avoid
dynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a
safety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human's behavior
as goal-driven but conditioned on the robot's plan, enabling us to capture
influence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical
and belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in
human behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE
(Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high-dimensional
(39-D) simulated human-robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline
game-theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust
baseline that treats the human as a worst-case adversary, a safety controller
that does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy-function-based
safety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage
the influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing
the robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate
during task execution.

| Decoding Style: Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Image-Guided Outfit
  Recommendation with Preference | Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan |   Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding
both fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper
presents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large
language models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their \"black box\" and static
nature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item
visual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style
and color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis
for personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the
open-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability
to recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative
examples is employed to enhance the LLM's decision-making process. This creates
a self-enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in
line with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore
dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill-in-the-blank,
and complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework's
ability to generate stylish, trend-aligned outfit suggestions, continuously
improving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our
proposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more
cohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the
proposed framework's potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate
suggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit
generation.

| Mechanical Wannier-Stark Ladder of Diamond Spin-Mechanical Lamb Wave
  Resonators | Philip Andrango, Hailin Wang |   We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier-Stark ladders of
diamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with
ultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin
properties. Three nearest-neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric
configurations and a large range of coupling rates have been explored for the
realization of Wannier-Stark ladders of LWRs, potentially enabling long-range
connectivity between spin qubits through their interactions with mechanical
vibrations. Additional analysis on the effects of disorder indicates that the
proposed Wannier-Stark ladder can be robust against realistic experimental
imperfections. The development of mechanical quantum networks of spin qubits
with long-range connectivity can open the door to the implementation of newly
developed quantum low-density parity-check codes in solid-state systems.

| MAgICoRe: Multi-Agent, Iterative, Coarse-to-Fine Refinement for
  Reasoning | Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Archiki Prasad, Swarnadeep Saha, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal |   Large Language Models' (LLM) reasoning can be improved using test-time
aggregation strategies, i.e., generating multiple samples and voting among
generated samples. While these improve performance, they often reach a
saturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated
feedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key
challenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can
over-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and
address errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to
identify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding
how many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too
soon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose
MAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty
as easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard
ones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error
localization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores.
Moreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with
three agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on
step-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure
sufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating
further rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5
and show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of
MAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by
4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with
baselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our
ablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe's RMs and multi-agent
communication.

| Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka |   Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string
processing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into
blocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence
of a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another
occurrence earlier in $T$. Due to numerous applications, LZ77 factorization is
one of the most studied problems on strings. In the 47 years since its
inception, several algorithms were developed for different models of
computation, including parallel, GPU, external-memory, and quantum. Remarkably,
however, the complexity of the most basic variant is still not settled: All
existing algorithms in the RAM model run in $\Omega(n)$ time, which is a
$\Theta(\log n)$ factor away from the lower bound of $\Omega(n/\log n)$
(following from the necessity to read the input, which takes $\Theta(n/\log n)$
space for $T\in\{0,1\}^{n}$).
  We present the first $o(n)$-time algorithm for LZ77 factorization, breaking
the linear-time barrier present for nearly 50 years. For $T\in\{0,1\}^{n}$, our
algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(n/\sqrt{\log n})=o(n)$ time and uses the optimal
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log n)$ working space. Our algorithm generalizes to
$\Sigma=[0..\sigma)$, where $\sigma=n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The runtime and
working space then become $\mathcal{O}((n\log\sigma)/\sqrt{\log n})$ and
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma} n)$. To obtain our algorithm, we prove a more
general result: For any constant $\epsilon\in(0,1)$ and $T\in[0..\sigma)^{n}$,
in $\mathcal{O}((n\log\sigma)/\sqrt{\log n})$ time and using
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma}n)$ space, we can construct an
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma}n)$-size index that, given any $P=T[j..j+\ell)$
(represented as $(j,\ell)$), computes the leftmost occurrence of $P$ in $T$ in
$\mathcal{O}(\log^{\epsilon}n)$ time. In other words, we solve the
indexing/online variant of the LZ77 problem.

| Experimental Evidence That Conversational Artificial Intelligence Can
  Steer Consumer Behavior Without Detection | Tobias Werner, Ivan Soraperra, Emilio Calvano, David C. Parkes, Iyad Rahwan |   Conversational AI models are becoming increasingly popular and are about to
replace traditional search engines for information retrieval and product
discovery. This raises concerns about monetization strategies and the potential
for subtle consumer manipulation. Companies may have financial incentives to
steer users toward search results or products in a conversation in ways that
are unnoticeable to consumers. Using a behavioral experiment, we show that
conversational AI models can indeed significantly shift consumer preferences.
We discuss implications and ask whether regulators are sufficiently prepared to
combat potential consumer deception.

M. Houff, F. G. Kondev, A. E. Lovell, A. T. Mohan, G. E. Morgan, C. Quick, G. Savard, K. S. Sharma, T. M. Sprouse, L. Varriano |   Atomic masses are a foundational quantity in our understanding of nuclear
structure, astrophysics and fundamental symmetries. The long-standing goal of
creating a predictive global model for the binding energy of a nucleus remains
a significant challenge, however, and prompts the need for precise measurements
of atomic masses to serve as anchor points for model developments. We present
precise mass measurements of neutron-rich Ru and Pd isotopes performed at the
Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade facility at Argonne National
Laboratory using the Canadian Penning Trap mass spectrometer. The masses of
$^{108}$Ru, $^{110}$Ru and $^{116}$Pd were measured to a relative mass
precision $\delta m/m \approx 10^{-8}$ via the phase-imaging
ion-cyclotron-resonance technique, and represent an improvement of
approximately an order of magnitude over previous measurements. These mass data
were used in conjunction with the physically interpretable machine learning
(PIML) model, which uses a mixture density neural network to model mass
excesses via a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The effects of our new mass
data on a Bayesian-updating of a PIML model are presented.

| MoRAG -- Multi-Fusion Retrieval Augmented Generation for Human Motion | Kalakonda Sai Shashank, Shubh Maheshwari, Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla |   We introduce MoRAG, a novel multi-part fusion based retrieval-augmented
generation strategy for text-based human motion generation. The method enhances
motion diffusion models by leveraging additional knowledge obtained through an
improved motion retrieval process. By effectively prompting large language
models (LLMs), we address spelling errors and rephrasing issues in motion
retrieval. Our approach utilizes a multi-part retrieval strategy to improve the
generalizability of motion retrieval across the language space. We create
diverse samples through the spatial composition of the retrieved motions.
Furthermore, by utilizing low-level, part-specific motion information, we can
construct motion samples for unseen text descriptions. Our experiments
demonstrate that our framework can serve as a plug-and-play module, improving
the performance of motion diffusion models. Code, pretrained models and sample

personalized rapid customization has emerged as a significant trend. In this
report, we introduce Takin AudioLLM, a series of techniques and models, mainly
including Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, specifically designed for
audiobook production. These models are capable of zero-shot speech production,
generating high-quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human
speech and facilitating individuals to customize the speech content according
to their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec
language model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a
multi-task training framework, capable of generating high-fidelity natural
speech in a zero-shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and
timbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while
advocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its
naturalness and expressiveness. Last, we propose the Takin Morphing system with
highly decoupled and advanced timbre and prosody modeling approaches, which
enables individuals to customize speech production with their preferred timbre
and prosody in a precise and controllable manner. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness and robustness of our Takin AudioLLM series models.

to sparse computation through expert routing, selectively activating only a
small subset of expert modules. However, sparse computation challenges
traditional training practices, as discrete expert routing hinders standard
backpropagation and thus gradient-based optimization, which are the cornerstone
of deep learning. To better pursue the scaling power of MoE, we introduce GRIN
(GRadient-INformed MoE training), which incorporates sparse gradient estimation
for expert routing and configures model parallelism to avoid token dropping.
Applying GRIN to autoregressive language modeling, we develop a top-2
16$\times$3.8B MoE model. Our model, with only 6.6B activated parameters,
outperforms a 7B dense model and matches the performance of a 14B dense model
trained on the same data. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks
demonstrate the potential of GRIN to significantly enhance MoE efficacy,
achieving 79.4 on MMLU, 83.7 on HellaSwag, 74.4 on HumanEval, and 58.9 on MATH.

| BERT-VBD: Vietnamese Multi-Document Summarization Framework | Tuan-Cuong Vuong, Trang Mai Xuan, Thien Van Luong |   In tackling the challenge of Multi-Document Summarization (MDS), numerous
methods have been proposed, spanning both extractive and abstractive
summarization techniques. However, each approach has its own limitations,
making it less effective to rely solely on either one. An emerging and
promising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractive
summarization methods. Despite the plethora of studies in this domain, research
on the combined methodology remains scarce, particularly in the context of
Vietnamese language processing. This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDS
framework leveraging a two-component pipeline architecture that integrates
extractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs an
extractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This is
achieved by a modification of the pre-trained BERT network, which derives
semantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet network
structures. The second component utilizes the VBD-LLaMA2-7B-50b model for
abstractive summarization, ultimately generating the final summary document.
Our proposed framework demonstrates a positive performance, attaining ROUGE-2
scores of 39.6% on the VN-MDS dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art
baselines.

| Einstein-dilaton-four-Maxwell Holographic Anisotropic Models | Irina Ya. Aref'eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov |   In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the
five-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell models has played a crucial role.
Typically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while
additional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A
more general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field
represents spatial longitudinal-transverse anisotropy, while the third and
fourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We
consider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero
temperature and five functions at non-zero temperature. Maxwell field related
to the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,
whereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.
We demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of
the seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations -- either the
dilaton or the vector potential equation -- follows from the Einstein equations
and the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi
identity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress-energy
tensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is
provided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to
three Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis
shows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein
equations and the equation for the vector potential

| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components
  for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco-Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram |   Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data
together with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal
components used. It is therefore important to determine the number of
significant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a
variational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for
estimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of
samples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This
eliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of
principal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.
This framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows
and columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),
and with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data
with arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as
cultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our
method on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may
underestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the
synthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical
dataset. These results suggest that it is broadly applicable across the life
sciences.

| Linguini: A benchmark for language-agnostic linguistic reasoning | Eduardo Sánchez, Belen Alastruey, Christophe Ropers, Pontus Stenetorp, Mikel Artetxe, Marta R. Costa-jussà |   We propose a new benchmark to measure a language model's linguistic reasoning
skills without relying on pre-existing language-specific knowledge. The test
covers 894 questions grouped in 160 problems across 75 (mostly) extremely
low-resource languages, extracted from the International Linguistic Olympiad
corpus. To attain high accuracy on this benchmark, models don't need previous
knowledge of the tested language, as all the information needed to solve the
linguistic puzzle is presented in the context. We find that, while all analyzed
models rank below 25% accuracy, there is a significant gap between open and
closed models, with the best-performing proprietary model at 24.05% and the
best-performing open model at 8.84%.

| From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the
  primordial black hole reheating scenario | Guillem Domènech, Jan Tränkle |   We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs
originate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight
PBHs with masses $M\lesssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat
it via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate
whether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH
reheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the
initial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer
functions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and
isocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation
of state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH
dominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the
spectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive
to $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density
fluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance
as a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
observations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the
initial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we
find that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several
future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas,
especially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any
early matter-dominated universe scenario.

| Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules | Anqi Zhang, Wilson S. Geisler |   Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We
investigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented
displays having well-separated potential target-object locations. Performance
was compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption
that the information from the different potential target locations is
statistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than
optimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the
implausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show
that three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical
results. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near
optimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the
central potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise
causes search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These
findings have far-reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks
and other identification tasks in humans and other animals.

| Far-from-equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann
  approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows
  $v_n$ | Vincenzo Nugara, Vincenzo Greco, Salvatore Plumari |   We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal
system in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution
function and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system
sizes $R$ and interaction strength $\eta/s$ and identify universality classes
based upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each
of this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $\hat
\gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results
highlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum
moments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to
a 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of
different sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a
similar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse
flow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system
size and $\eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and
their response functions, along with the impact of the $\eta/s$ and the system
transverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in
momentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow
$v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of
large opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems
evolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play
in this process.

Qwen2.5-Math and Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct-1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the
Qwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self-improvement
throughout the entire pipeline, from pre-training and post-training to
inference: (1) During the pre-training phase, Qwen2-Math-Instruct is utilized
to generate large-scale, high-quality mathematical data. (2) In the
post-training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive
sampling from Qwen2-Math-Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative
evolution of data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model,
it's possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the
next round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the
ultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct.
(3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling,
optimizing the model's performance.
  Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced
mathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics
datasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and
AIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math
competition problems.

| Computing the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two-Dimensional
  Strongly-Correlated Systems | Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn |   We show that the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time-reversal
invariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary-condition
dependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non-interacting and
strongly-correlated insulators. By introducing a family of quasi-single
particle states associated to the many-body ground state of an insulator, we
show that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant can be expressed as the integral of a
certain Berry connection over half the space of boundary conditions, providing
an alternative expression to the formulations that appear in [Lee et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. $\textbf{100}$, 186807 (2008)]. We show the equivalence of the
different many-body formulations of the invariant, and show how they reduce to
known band-theoretic results for Slater determinant ground states. Finally, we
apply our results to analytically calculate the invariant for the Kane-Mele
model with nonlocal (orbital) Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) interactions. This
rigorously establishes the topological nontriviality of the Kane-Mele model
with HK interactions, and represents one of the few exact calculations of the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a strongly-interacting system.

| Weak Lensing analysis of Abell 2390 using short exposures | A. Dutta, J. R. Peterson, T. Rose, M. Cianfaglione, A. Bonafede, G. Li, G. Sembroski |   We present a weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 2390 at z =
0.23 using second moment shape measurements made in 411 short 60s exposures.
The exposures are obtained in three broadband photometric filters (g, r, i)
using WIYN-ODI. Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a
moment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching
algorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The
measurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight
to obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim
simulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find
the mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We
also find the E-Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic
structures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical
and X-Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to
map large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of
the cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the
peaks are similar to X-Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster
and show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.

  Speech LLM Training and Inference | Edresson Casanova, Ryan Langman, Paarth Neekhara, Shehzeen Hussain, Jason Li, Subhankar Ghosh, Ante Jukić, Sang-gil Lee |   Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing
through audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the

leverages finite scalar quantization and adversarial training with large speech
language models to achieve high-quality audio compression with a 1.89 kbps

| Stronger Baseline Models -- A Key Requirement for Aligning Machine
  Learning Research with Clinical Utility | Nathan Wolfrath, Joel Wolfrath, Hengrui Hu, Anjishnu Banerjee, Anai N. Kothari |   Machine Learning (ML) research has increased substantially in recent years,
due to the success of predictive modeling across diverse application domains.
However, well-known barriers exist when attempting to deploy ML models in
high-stakes, clinical settings, including lack of model transparency (or the
inability to audit the inference process), large training data requirements
with siloed data sources, and complicated metrics for measuring model utility.
In this work, we show empirically that including stronger baseline models in
healthcare ML evaluations has important downstream effects that aid
practitioners in addressing these challenges. Through a series of case studies,
we find that the common practice of omitting baselines or comparing against a
weak baseline model (e.g. a linear model with no optimization) obscures the
value of ML methods proposed in the research literature. Using these insights,
we propose some best practices that will enable practitioners to more
effectively study and deploy ML models in clinical settings.

| Revisiting Dark Photon Constraints from CMB Spectral Distortions | Jens Chluba, Bryce Cyr, Matthew C. Johnson |   Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide
stringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post-BBN (Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models
with COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.
Here, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark
photon conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous
works only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the
change to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon
distortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the
distortion has an opposite sign and a $\simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We
furthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover
the redshift range $\simeq 2\times 10^6-4\times 10^7$ between the $\mu$-era and
the end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints
for dark photon masses in the range $10^{-4}\,{\rm eV}\lesssim m_{\rm
dp}\lesssim 10^{-3}\,{\rm eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We
demonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon
to dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $\mu$-type distortion
independent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study
dark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with
CMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.

| Bi-objective trail-planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous
  environment | Cory M. Simon, Jeffrey Richley, Lucas Overbey, Darleen Perez-Lavin |   Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in
resource delivery, patrolling, information-gathering, agriculture, forest fire
fighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and
search-and-rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments -- with e.g.
rough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or
capturing robots -- should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of
risks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should
take the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the
team-level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward
from visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider
bi-objective trail-planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a
hazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed
graph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of
survival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a
robot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for
the Pareto-optimal robot-team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team
objectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive
the mission. A human decision-maker can then select trail plans that balance,
according to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony
optimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto-optimal set of
robot team trail plans. As a case study, we illustrate with an
information-gathering mission in an art museum.

| Pareto Data Framework: Steps Towards Resource-Efficient Decision Making
  Using Minimum Viable Data (MVD) | Tashfain Ahmed, Josh Siegel |   This paper introduces the Pareto Data Framework, an approach for identifying
and selecting the Minimum Viable Data (MVD) required for enabling machine
learning applications on constrained platforms such as embedded systems, mobile
devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We demonstrate that strategic
data reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing
bandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies
Minimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource-constrained
environments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient
practices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and
overprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for
optimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data
representation. An experimental methodology demonstrates effective acoustic
data characterization after downsampling, quantization, and truncation to
simulate reduced-fidelity sensors and network and storage constraints; results
shows that performance can be maintained up to 95\% with sample rates reduced
by 75\% and bit depths and clip length reduced by 50\% which translates into
substantial cost and resource reduction. These findings have implications on
the design and development of constrained systems. The paper also discusses
broader implications of the framework, including the potential to democratize
advanced AI technologies across IoT applications and sectors such as
agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing to improve access and multiply
the benefits of data-driven insights.

with computational efficiency. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a
powerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,
complex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in
performance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and
its innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer
knowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact
and efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application
across various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and
historical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are
highlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational
efficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical
deployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of
KD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the
breadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case
studies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,
such as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review
discusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical
constraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive
overview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS. Through this
organization, the paper not only elucidates the current state of research in KD
but also sets the stage for future research opportunities, thereby contributing

evidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,
these growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,
more and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth-dependent systems
and develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of
'growth dependence' still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,
which impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article
proposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the
concept of 'growth dependence' across socio-economic systems. We provide a
general definition consisting of four components that can be specified for
different empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of
measurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions
or properties of the system under investigation. According to our general
definition, a socio-economic system is growth-dependent if it requires a
long-term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to
maintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen
normative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to
three areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:
employment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies
demonstrate that whether or not a system is growth-dependent hinges not only on
the empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of
the concept of growth dependence. Our framework enables coherent, robust and
effective definitions and research questions, fostering comparability of
findings across different cases and disciplines.

| SPRMamba: Surgical Phase Recognition for Endoscopic Submucosal
  Dissection with Mamba | Xiangning Zhang, Jinnan Chen, Qingwei Zhang, Chengfeng Zhou, Zhengjie Zhang, Xiaobo Li, Dahong Qian |   Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive procedure
initially designed for the treatment of early gastric cancer but is now widely
used for various gastrointestinal lesions. Computer-assisted Surgery systems
have played a crucial role in improving the precision and safety of ESD
procedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognition
of surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesion
characteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real-time
surgical phase recognition algorithms. Existing surgical phase recognition
algorithms struggle to efficiently capture temporal contexts in video-based
scenarios, leading to insufficient performance. To address these issues, we
propose SPRMamba, a novel Mamba-based framework for ESD surgical phase
recognition. SPRMamba leverages the strengths of Mamba for long-term temporal
modeling while introducing the Scaled Residual TranMamba block to enhance the
capture of fine-grained details, overcoming the limitations of traditional
temporal models like Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformers.
Moreover, a Temporal Sample Strategy is introduced to accelerate the
processing, which is essential for real-time phase recognition in clinical
settings. Extensive testing on the ESD385 dataset and the cholecystectomy
Cholec80 dataset demonstrates that SPRMamba surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits greater robustness across various surgical phase
recognition tasks.

| Who's the GOAT? Sports Rankings and Data-Driven Random Walks on the
  Symmetric Group | Gian-Gabriel P. Garcia, J. Carlos Martínez Mori |   Given a collection of historical sports rankings, can one tell which player
is the greatest of all time (i.e., the GOAT)? In this work, we design a
data-driven random walk on the symmetric group to obtain a stationary
distribution over player rankings, spanning across different time periods in
sports history. We combine this distribution with a notion of stochastic
dominance to obtain a partial order over the players. We implement our methods
using publicly available data from the Association of Tennis Professionals
(ATP) and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) to find the GOATs in the

| Measuring Human and AI Values based on Generative Psychometrics with
  Large Language Models | Haoran Ye, Yuhang Xie, Yuanyi Ren, Hanjun Fang, Xin Zhang, Guojie Song |   Human values and their measurement are long-standing interdisciplinary
inquiry. Recent advances in AI have sparked renewed interest in this area, with
large language models (LLMs) emerging as both tools and subjects of value
measurement. This work introduces Generative Psychometrics for Values (GPV), an
LLM-based, data-driven value measurement paradigm, theoretically grounded in
text-revealed selective perceptions. We begin by fine-tuning an LLM for
accurate perception-level value measurement and verifying the capability of
LLMs to parse texts into perceptions, forming the core of the GPV pipeline.
Applying GPV to human-authored blogs, we demonstrate its stability, validity,
and superiority over prior psychological tools. Then, extending GPV to LLM
value measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometric
methodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free-form
outputs, enabling context-specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis of
measurement paradigms, indicating response biases of prior methods; and 3) an
attempt to bridge LLM values and their safety, revealing the predictive power
of different value systems and the impacts of various values on LLM safety.
Through interdisciplinary efforts, we aim to leverage AI for next-generation
psychometrics and psychometrics for value-aligned AI.

| FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated
  Long-Tailed Learning | Xiuhua Lu, Peng Li, Xuefeng Jiang |   Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy
in distributed machine learning. However, datasets distributed across each
client in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can
be globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly
affects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated
learning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it
fails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data.
This results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting
the equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a
methodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,
we propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the
local training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred
optimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state-of-the-art
methods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed
distribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10-LT and
CIFAR-100-LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of
model performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long-tailed
distribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.

| Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error
  Detection | Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia |   Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications. Doing
so requires overcoming the noise present on today's hardware. The quantum
approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling
up due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup
over state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems. However,
achieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require
fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant
implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection
code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the
algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with
up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we
propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance, and use it
to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance
to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our
model can be used to determine necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform
Goemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware. Our results demonstrate the
largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially
fault-tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date,
paving the way towards solving real-world applications with quantum computers.

| Cyclicity Analysis of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process | Vivek Kaushik |   In this thesis, we consider an $N$-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)
process satisfying the linear stochastic differential equation $d\mathbf x(t) =
- \mathbf B\mathbf x(t) dt + \boldsymbol \Sigma d \mathbf w(t).$ Here, $\mathbf
B$ is a fixed $N \times N$ circulant friction matrix whose eigenvalues have
positive real parts, $\boldsymbol \Sigma$ is a fixed $N \times M$ matrix. We
consider a signal propagation model governed by this OU process. In this model,
an underlying signal propagates throughout a network consisting of $N$ linked
sensors located in space. We interpret the $n$-th component of the OU process
as the measurement of the propagating effect made by the $n$-th sensor. The
matrix $\mathbf B$ represents the sensor network structure: if $\mathbf B$ has
first row $(b_1 \ , \ \dots \ , \ b_N),$ where $b_1>0$ and $b_2 \ , \ \dots \
,\ b_N \le 0,$ then the magnitude of $b_p$ quantifies how receptive the $n$-th
sensor is to activity within the $(n+p-1)$-th sensor. Finally, the $(m,n)$-th
entry of the matrix $\mathbf D = \frac{\boldsymbol \Sigma \boldsymbol
\Sigma^\text T}{2}$ is the covariance of the component noises injected into the
$m$-th and $n$-th sensors. For different choices of $\mathbf B$ and
$\boldsymbol \Sigma,$ we investigate whether Cyclicity Analysis enables us to
recover the structure of network. Roughly speaking, Cyclicity Analysis studies
the lead-lag dynamics pertaining to the components of a multivariate signal. We
specifically consider an $N \times N$ skew-symmetric matrix $\mathbf Q,$ known
as the lead matrix, in which the sign of its $(m,n)$-th entry captures the
lead-lag relationship between the $m$-th and $n$-th component OU processes. We
investigate whether the structure of the leading eigenvector of $\mathbf Q,$
the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of $\mathbf Q$ in
modulus, reflects the network structure induced by $\mathbf B.$

representations, to model complex transformations within learning algorithms.
Our contributions include the design of symmetry-enriched learning models, the
development of advanced optimization techniques leveraging categorical
symmetries, and the theoretical analysis of their implications for model
robustness, generalization, and convergence. Through rigorous proofs and
practical applications, we demonstrate that incorporating higher-dimensional

| Brain-Streams: fMRI-to-Image Reconstruction with Multi-modal Guidance | Jaehoon Joo, Taejin Jeong, Seongjae Hwang |   Understanding how humans process visual information is one of the crucial
steps for unraveling the underlying mechanism of brain activity. Recently, this
curiosity has motivated the fMRI-to-image reconstruction task; given the fMRI
data from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual
stimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent
Diffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex
visual stimuli such as high-resolution natural images from vision datasets.
Despite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often
lack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.
Consequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere
visuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs
effectively incorporate multi-modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,
and image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image
generations. Specifically, inspired by the two-streams hypothesis suggesting
that perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain
regions, our framework, Brain-Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain
regions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from
semantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information
regions, Brain-Streams provides accurate multi-modal guidance to LDMs. We
validate the reconstruction ability of Brain-Streams both quantitatively and
qualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI
data.

| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal
  execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huyên Pham |   Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and
constraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity
markets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general
propagator model under linear functional inequality constraints. The optimal
control is given explicitly in terms of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers
and their conditional expectations, as a solution to a linear stochastic
Fredholm equation. We propose a stochastic version of the Uzawa algorithm on
the dual problem to construct the stochastic Lagrange multipliers numerically
via a stochastic projected gradient ascent, combined with a least-squares Monte
Carlo regression step to approximate their conditional expectations. We
illustrate our findings on two different practical applications with stochastic
signals: (i) an optimal execution problem with an exponential or a power law
decaying transient impact, with either a `no-shorting' constraint in the
presence of a `sell' signal, a `no-buying' constraint in the presence of a
`buy' signal or a stochastic `stop-trading' constraint whenever the exogenous
price drops below a specified reference level; (ii) a battery storage problem
with instantaneous operating costs, seasonal signals and fixed constraints on
both the charging power and the load capacity of the battery.

| Skill matching at scale: freelancer-project alignment for efficient
  multilingual candidate retrieval | Warren Jouanneau, Marc Palyart, Emma Jouffroy |   Finding the perfect match between a job proposal and a set of freelancers is
not an easy task to perform at scale, especially in multiple languages. In this
paper, we propose a novel neural retriever architecture that tackles this

freelancer profiles by leveraging pre-trained multilingual language models. The
latter are used as backbone for a custom transformer architecture that aims to
keep the structure of the profiles and project. This model is trained with a
contrastive loss on historical data. Thanks to several experiments, we show
that this approach effectively captures skill matching similarity and
facilitates efficient matching, outperforming traditional methods.

| An Efficient Projection-Based Next-best-view Planning Framework for
  Reconstruction of Unknown Objects | Zhizhou Jia, Shaohui Zhang, Qun Hao |   Efficiently and completely capturing the three-dimensional data of an object
is a fundamental problem in industrial and robotic applications. The task of
next-best-view (NBV) planning is to infer the pose of the next viewpoint based
on the current data, and gradually realize the complete three-dimensional
reconstruction. Many existing algorithms, however, suffer a large computational
burden due to the use of ray-casting. To address this, this paper proposes a
projection-based NBV planning framework. It can select the next best view at an
extremely fast speed while ensuring the complete scanning of the object.
Specifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into
ellipsoids based on the voxel structure.Then, the next best view is selected
from the candidate views using a projection-based viewpoint quality evaluation
function in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy. This process
replaces the ray-casting in voxel structures, significantly improving the
computational efficiency. Comparative experiments with other algorithms in a
simulation environment show that the framework proposed in this paper can
achieve 10 times efficiency improvement on the basis of capturing roughly the
same coverage. The real-world experimental results also prove the efficiency
and feasibility of the framework.

| Undersampling effects on observed periods of coronal oscillations | Daye Lim, Tom Van Doorsselaere, Valery M. Nakariakov, Dmitrii Y. Kolotkov, Yuhang Gao, David Berghmans |   Context. Recent observations of decayless transverse oscillations have shown
two branches in the relationship between periods and loop lengths. One is a
linear relationship, interpreted as a standing mode. The other shows almost no
correlation and has not yet been interpreted conclusively. Aims. We
investigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless
oscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely
follow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations
are standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations
where the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase
are randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal
by considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of
telescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast
Fourier transform. Results. When the sampling cadence is getting closer to the
actual oscillation period, a tendency for overestimating periods in short loops
is enhanced. The relationship between loop lengths and periods of the sampled
signals shows the two branches as in the observation. Conclusions. We find that
long periods of decayless oscillations occurring in short loops could be the
result of undersampling.

| Enwrapped Perylene Bisimide Enables Room Temperature Polariton Lasing
  and Photonic Lattices | Dominik Horneber, Johannes Düreth, Tim Schembri, Simon Betzold, Matthias Stolte, Sven Höfling, Frank Würthner, Sebastian Klembt |   Perylene bisimides (PBIs) are organic dyes with photoluminescence quantum
yields (PLQY) close to unity in solution and great thermal and photo-chemical
stability. These features alongside the tunability of their solid-state packing
arrangement via chemical functionalization make this material class an
excellent candidate for exciton-polariton lasing at room temperature. Polariton
lasing is well understood in III-V semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures,
however, the search for emitter materials for robust and versatile room
temperature applications is ongoing. While e.g. perovskites and several organic
materials have been identified to support polariton lasing, many of these
materials lack tunability and long-term stability under ambient conditions.
Here, we fabricate optical microcavities using a strongly enwrapped PBI
chromophore with prevailing monomer-like absorption and emission properties in
the solid state. Voluminous bay-substituents prevent stacking induced
PLQY-quenching, thereby enabling polariton lasing at room temperature.
Additionally, photonic confinement in single hemispheric resonators is
demonstrated leading to localized polaritonic modes with discrete energies, as
well as optical lattices revealing distinct polaritonic band-structures. Due to
the possibility of tunable properties by the precise control of the solid-state
packing arrangement of PBI emitters, our results pave the way for
polarization-dependent light-matter coupling, including topological photonic
effects within oriented crystalline thin-film microcavity structures.

| IMRL: Integrating Visual, Physical, Temporal, and Geometric
  Representations for Enhanced Food Acquisition | Rui Liu, Zahiruddin Mahammad, Amisha Bhaskar, Pratap Tokekar |   Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality
of life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse
food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents
unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric
information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g.,
color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially
when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance.
We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition.
Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy
based on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, such
representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse
acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which
integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance
the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach
captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular,
liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and
introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and
assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies
based on context, improving the robot's capability to handle diverse food
acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach's
robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations,
including zero-shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves
improvement up to $35\%$ in success rate compared with the best-performing
baseline.

| Uncovering liquid-substrate fluctuation effects on crystal growth and
  disordered hyperuniformity of two-dimensional materials | S. K. Mkhonta, Zhi-Feng Huang, K. R. Elder |   We investigate the growth of two-dimensional (2D) crystals on fluctuating
surfaces using a phase field crystal model that is relevant on atomic length
and diffusive time scales. Motivated by recent experiments which achieved
unprecedented fast growth of large-size high-quality 2D crystals on liquid
substrates, we uncover novel effects of liquid surfaces on microstructural
ordering. We find that substrate fluctuations generate short-ranged noise that
speeds up crystallization and grain growth of the overlayer, surpassing that of
free-standing system. Coupling to the liquid substrate fluctuations can also
modulate local randomness, leading to intriguing disordered structures with
hidden spatial order, i.e., disordered hyperuniformity. These results reveal
the physical mechanisms underlying the fast growth of 2D crystals on liquid
surfaces and demonstrate a novel strategy for synthesizing disordered
hyperuniform thin film structures.

| The Impact of Element Ordering on LM Agent Performance | Wayne Chi, Ameet Talwalkar, Chris Donahue |   There has been a surge of interest in language model agents that can navigate
virtual environments such as the web or desktop. To navigate such environments,
agents benefit from information on the various elements (e.g., buttons, text,
or images) present. It remains unclear which element attributes have the
greatest impact on agent performance, especially in environments that only
provide a graphical representation (i.e., pixels). Here we find that the
ordering in which elements are presented to the language model is surprisingly
impactful--randomizing element ordering in a webpage degrades agent performance
comparably to removing all visible text from an agent's state representation.
While a webpage provides a hierarchical ordering of elements, there is no such
ordering when parsing elements directly from pixels. Moreover, as tasks become
more challenging and models more sophisticated, our experiments suggest that
the impact of ordering increases. Finding an effective ordering is non-trivial.
We investigate the impact of various element ordering methods in web and
desktop environments. We find that dimensionality reduction provides a viable
ordering for pixel-only environments. We train a UI element detection model to
derive elements from pixels and apply our findings to an agent
benchmark--OmniACT--where we only have access to pixels. Our method completes
more than two times as many tasks on average relative to the previous
state-of-the-art.

| Quark saturation in the QCD phase diagram | Marcus Bluhm, Yuki Fujimoto, Larry McLerran, Marlene Nahrgang |   We determine the onset of Quarkyonic Matter corresponding to values of
temperature and baryon chemical potential at which the quark phase space
density becomes one. At zero temperature for baryon chemical potentials below
the mass of the Lambda baryon, only nucleons contribute to the quark density.
This is different at finite temperature, where all baryons, mesons and their
resonances can be excited and thus add quarks to the phase space. The
probability density to find a quark inside a hadron is determined using the
Yukawa ansatz of the IdylliQ model of Quarkyonic Matter. We estimate separately
the magnitude of the various contributions of nucleons, Delta baryons, pions as
well as further hadrons and resonances. The uncertainty in the parametrization
of the probability density to find a quark inside a nucleon is spanned by
assuming that at zero temperature the transition density to Quarkyonic Matter
is between one and three times that of nuclear matter. Various predictions for
a possible critical point associated with the chiral phase transition are found
close to a triple point at which the line of the deconfinement transition and
the curve associated with the transition to Quarkyonic Matter intersect. These
considerations provide an estimate for the region in the QCD phase diagram
where Quarkyonic Matter may be found.

  The global existence of weak solutions or classical solutions to the above
system has been established in both one- and two-dimensional bounded convex
domains in previous works. However, the results concerning the large time

| ReLU Surrogates in Mixed-Integer MPC for Irrigation Scheduling | Bernard T. Agyeman, Jinfeng Liu, Sirish L. Shah |   Efficient water management in agriculture is important for mitigating the
growing freshwater scarcity crisis. Mixed-integer Model Predictive Control
(MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex
scheduling problems in agricultural irrigation. However, the computational
complexity of mixed-integer MPC still poses a significant challenge,
particularly in large-scale applications. This study proposes an approach to
enhance the computational efficiency of mixed-integer MPC-based irrigation
schedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture
dynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed-integer linear
representation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the
mixed-integer MPC-based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a
mixed-integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed-integer
nonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global
optimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated
through comparative studies conducted on a large-scale agricultural field
across two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models,
specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used
triggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU-based approach significantly
reduces solution times -- by up to 99.5\% -- while achieving comparable
performance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water
Use Efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, the ReLU-based approach maintains enhanced
performance in terms of total prescribed irrigation and IWUE compared to the

| Design of Ligand-Binding Proteins with Atomic Flow Matching | Junqi Liu, Shaoning Li, Chence Shi, Zhi Yang, Jian Tang |   Designing novel proteins that bind to small molecules is a long-standing
challenge in computational biology, with applications in developing catalysts,
biosensors, and more. Current computational methods rely on the assumption that
the binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible,
as conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon
binding. In this work, we formulate proteins and molecules as unified
biotokens, and present AtomFlow, a novel deep generative model under the
flow-matching framework for the design of ligand-binding proteins from the 2D
target molecular graph alone. Operating on representative atoms of biotokens,
AtomFlow captures the flexibility of ligands and generates ligand conformations
and protein backbone structures iteratively. We consider the multi-scale nature
of biotokens and demonstrate that AtomFlow can be effectively trained on a
subset of structures from the Protein Data Bank, by matching flow vector field
using an SE(3) equivariant structure prediction network. Experimental results
show that our method can generate high fidelity ligand-binding proteins and
achieve performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model RFDiffusionAA,
while not requiring bound ligand structures. As a general framework, AtomFlow
holds the potential to be applied to various biomolecule generation tasks in
the future.

| Denoising diffusion models for high-resolution microscopy image
  restoration | Pamela Osuna-Vargas, Maren H. Wehrheim, Lucas Zinz, Johanna Rahm, Ashwin Balakrishnan, Alexandra Kaminer, Mike Heilemann, Matthias Kaschube |   Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at
the nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological
organization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of
fluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses
remain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced
laser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and
increased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high-resolution
images by conditioning the model on low-resolution information. Additionally,
the probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images
that tend to further increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We show that our model
achieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously
best-performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly,
while any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but
not all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all
four data sets, suggesting high generalizability.

| Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Via Data Pruning | Andrea Napoli, Paul White |   The removal of carefully-selected examples from training data has recently
emerged as an effective way of improving the robustness of machine learning
models. However, the best way to select these examples remains an open
question. In this paper, we consider the problem from the perspective of
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). We propose AdaPrune, a method for UDA
whereby training examples are removed to attempt to align the training
distribution to that of the target data. By adopting the maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) as the criterion for alignment, the problem can be neatly
formulated and solved as an integer quadratic program. We evaluate our approach
on a real-world domain shift task of bioacoustic event detection. As a method
for UDA, we show that AdaPrune outperforms related techniques, and is
complementary to other UDA algorithms such as CORAL. Our analysis of the
relationship between the MMD and model accuracy, along with t-SNE plots,
validate the proposed method as a principled and well-founded way of performing
data pruning.

| The elastica sling | Alessandro Cazzolli, Francesco Dal Corso |   The nonlinear mechanics of a flexible elastic rod constrained at its edges by
a pair of sliding sleeves is analyzed. The planar equilibrium configurations of
this variable-length elastica are found to have shape defined only by the
inclination of the two constraints, while their distance is responsible only
for scaling the size. By extending the theoretical stability criterion
available for systems under isoperimetric constraints to the case of variable
domains, the existence of no more than one stable equilibrium solution is
revealed. The set of sliding sleeves' inclination pairs for which the stability
is lost are identified. Such critical conditions allow the indefinite ejection
of the flexible rod from the sliding sleeves, thus realizing an elastica sling.
Finally, the theoretical findings are validated by experiments on a physical
prototype. The present results lead to a novel actuation principle that may
find application as a mechanism in energy harvesting, wave mitigation devices,
and soft robotic locomotion.

| Online Refractive Camera Model Calibration in Visual Inertial Odometry | Mohit Singh, Kostas Alexis |   This paper presents a general refractive camera model and online
co-estimation of odometry and the refractive index of unknown media. This
enables operation in diverse and varying refractive fluids, given only the
camera calibration in air. The refractive index is estimated online as a state
variable of a monocular visual-inertial odometry framework in an iterative
formulation using the proposed camera model. The method was verified on data
collected using an underwater robot traversing inside a pool. The evaluations
demonstrate convergence to the ideal refractive index for water despite
significant perturbations in the initialization. Simultaneously, the approach
enables on-par visual-inertial odometry performance in refractive media without
prior knowledge of the refractive index or requirement of medium-specific
camera calibration.

| Influence of dislocations in multilayer graphene stacks: A phase field
  crystal study | K. R. Elder, Zhi-Feng Huang, T. Ala-Nissila |   In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene
stacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a
recently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems
incorporating out-of-plane deformations and parameterized to match to density
functional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems. The
specific configuration considered consists of one monolayer containing four
$5|7$ dislocations (i.e., two dislocation dipoles) sandwiched in between
perfect graphene layers. The study reveals how the strain field from the
dislocations in the defected layer leads to out-of-plane deformations that in
turn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are
made for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a
defect-free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and
system size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by
roughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence
across the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height
profiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.

| PAD-FT: A Lightweight Defense for Backdoor Attacks via Data Purification
  and Fine-Tuning | Yukai Xu, Yujie Gu, Kouichi Sakurai |   Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks,
particularly as recent advancements have led to increasingly subtle
implantation, making the defense more challenging. Existing defense mechanisms
typically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and
involve retraining an auxiliary model or fine-tuning the entire victim model.
However, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always
feasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and
lightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD-FT, that does not require an
additional clean dataset and fine-tunes only a very small part of the model to
disinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a
simple data purification process to identify and select the most-likely clean
data from the poisoned training dataset. The self-purified clean dataset is
then used for activation clipping and fine-tuning only the last classification
layer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation
clipping, and classifier fine-tuning, our mechanism PAD-FT demonstrates
superior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as
confirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.

| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing
  data in Irish sagas | P. MacCarron |   For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts
in order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify
similarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the
significance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture
requires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and
often impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the
network of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that
the top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent
with central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has
been lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust
to a large random removal of edges.

| The repetition threshold for ternary rich words | James D. Currie, Lucas Mol, Jarkko Peltomäki |   In 2014, Vesti proposed the problem of determining the repetition threshold
for infinite rich words, i.e., for infinite words in which all factors of
length $n$ contain $n$ distinct nonempty palindromic factors. In 2020, Currie,
Mol, and Rampersad proved a conjecture of Baranwal and Shallit that the
repetition threshold for binary rich words is $2 + \sqrt{2}/2$. In this paper,
we prove a structure theorem for $16/7$-power-free ternary rich words. Using
the structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich
words is $1 + 1/(3 - \mu) \approx 2.25876324$, where $\mu$ is the unique real
root of the polynomial $x^3 - 2x^2 - 1$.

| Fitting Multilevel Factor Models | Tetiana Parshakova, Trevor Hastie, Stephen Boyd |   We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance
given by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~\cite{parshakova2023factor}. We
develop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of
the observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and
maintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved
through a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive
definite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of an invertible PSD MLR matrix
is also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the
recursive Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of
the inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky
factorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities,
yielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement. This paper is
accompanied by an open-source package that implements the proposed methods.

| Drifts of the sub-stellar points of the TRAPPIST-1 planets | Revol Alexandre, Émeline Bolmont, Mariana Sastre, Gabriel Tobie, Anne-Sophie Libert, Mathilde Kervazo, Sergi Blanco-Cuaresma |   Accurate modeling of tidal interactions is crucial for interpreting recent
JWST observations of the thermal emissions of TRAPPIST-1~b and c and for
characterizing the surface conditions and potential habitability of the other
planets in the system. Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by
tidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to
their proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the
TRAPPIST-1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In
this work, we present the recent implementation of the co-planar tidal torque
and forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N-body code
Posidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using
a tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of
each planet by taking into account their multi-layer internal structure
computed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets
are not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state.
Planet-planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and
tides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a
result, the sub-stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and
long-timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with
periods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.

| Quantum Magic and Multi-Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei | Florian Brökemeier, S. Momme Hengstenberg, James W. T. Keeble, Caroline E. P. Robin, Federico Rocco, Martin J. Savage |   Motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the
quantum complexity of $p$-shell and $sd$-shell nuclei. Valence-space nuclear
shell-model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit
registers using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$-shell and 24
qubits for the $sd$-shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement
($n$-tangles) and magic (non-stabilizerness) are determined. While exact
evaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of
active nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex
nuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique
is introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed
nuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\sim 8$ for some
nuclei. Significant multi-nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$-shell,
dominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of
magic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on
the path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion.
These results indicate that quantum-computing resources will accelerate
precision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.

| Post-Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a
  massive, rotating object | Lorenzo Iorio |   The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the
general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring
components of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are
analytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level. To the Newtonian
order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as
well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation
in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the
primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first
to 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system
along an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred
close to the Sun's flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due
to the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of
microarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for
the post-Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)
spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of
the latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current
(formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would
bring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the
predicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not
changed by any of the post--Keplerian accelerations considered. The
calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any
alternative models of gravity as well.

| Generalized Robot Learning Framework | Jiahuan Yan, Zhouyang Hong, Yu Zhao, Yu Tian, Yunxin Liu, Travis Davies, Luhui Hu |   Imitation based robot learning has recently gained significant attention in
the robotics field due to its theoretical potential for transferability and
generalizability. However, it remains notoriously costly, both in terms of
hardware and data collection, and deploying it in real-world environments
demands meticulous setup of robots and precise experimental conditions. In this
paper, we present a low-cost robot learning framework that is both easily
reproducible and transferable to various robots and environments. We
demonstrate that deployable imitation learning can be successfully applied even
to industrial-grade robots, not just expensive collaborative robotic arms.
Furthermore, our results show that multi-task robot learning is achievable with
simple network architectures and fewer demonstrations than previously thought
necessary. As the current evaluating method is almost subjective when it comes
to real-world manipulation tasks, we propose Voting Positive Rate (VPR) - a
novel evaluation strategy that provides a more objective assessment of
performance. We conduct an extensive comparison of success rates across various
self-designed tasks to validate our approach. To foster collaboration and
support the robot learning community, we have open-sourced all relevant
datasets and model checkpoints, available at huggingface.co/ZhiChengAI.

| PARAPHRASUS : A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Paraphrase
  Detection Models | Andrianos Michail, Simon Clematide, Juri Opitz |   The task of determining whether two texts are paraphrases has long been a
challenge in NLP. However, the prevailing notion of paraphrase is often quite
simplistic, offering only a limited view of the vast spectrum of paraphrase
phenomena. Indeed, we find that evaluating models in a paraphrase dataset can
leave uncertainty about their true semantic understanding. To alleviate this,
we release paraphrasus, a benchmark designed for multi-dimensional assessment
of paraphrase detection models and finer model selection. We find that
paraphrase detection models under a fine-grained evaluation lens exhibit
trade-offs that cannot be captured through a single classification dataset.

| Dual-Layer Training and Decoding of Large Language Model with
  Simultaneously Thinking and Speaking | Ningyuan Xi, Xiaoyu Wang, Yetao Wu, Teng Chen, Qingqing Gu, Jinxian Qu, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong Chen, Luo Ji |   Large Language Model can reasonably understand and generate human expressions
but may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have
been several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but
most of them are not data-driven or training-based. In this paper, we are
motivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel
model architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts
and then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines
to annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt-response samples, then
add language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We
train the language model by the thoughts-augmented data and successfully let
the thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally
output more reasonable responses. Both qualitative examples and quantitative
results validate the effectiveness and performance of TaS. Our code is

| Artemis: Efficient Commit-and-Prove SNARKs for zkML | Hidde Lycklama, Alexander Viand, Nikolay Avramov, Nicolas Küchler, Anwar Hithnawi |   The widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) in various critical
applications, from healthcare to autonomous systems, has raised significant
concerns about privacy, accountability, and trustworthiness. To address these
concerns, recent research has focused on developing zero-knowledge machine
learning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of
ML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have
substantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily
optimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the
substantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the
model and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new
Commit-and-Prove SNARK (CP-SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that
effectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML
pipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white-box use of the
underlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic
polynomial commitment and only makes black-box use of the proof system. As a
result, Artemis is compatible with state-of-the-art proof systems without
trusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP-SNARKs, evaluate
their performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial
improvements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover
costs and maintaining efficiency even for large-scale models. For example, for
the VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from
11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML
towards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and
complex ML models.

| MMP for Enriques pairs and singular Enriques varieties | Francesco Antonio Denisi, Ángel David Ríos Ortiz, Nikolaos Tsakanikas, Zhixin Xie |   We introduce and study the class of primitive Enriques varieties, whose
smooth members are Enriques manifolds. We provide several examples and we
demonstrate that this class is stable under the operations of the Minimal Model
Program (MMP). In particular, given an Enriques manifold $Y$ and an effective
$\mathbb{R}$-divisor $B_Y$ on $Y$ such that the pair $(Y,B_Y)$ is log
canonical, we prove that any $(K_Y+B_Y)$-MMP terminates with a minimal model
$(Y',B_{Y'})$ of $(Y,B_Y)$, where $Y'$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial primitive
Enriques variety with canonical singularities. Finally, we investigate the
asymptotic theory of Enriques manifolds.

| Numerical renormalization group calculations for magnetic impurity
  systems with spin-orbit coupling and crystal-field effects | Aitor Calvo-Fernández, María Blanco-Rey, Asier Eiguren |   Exploiting symmetries in the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method
significantly enhances performance by improving accuracy, increasing
computational speed, and optimizing memory efficiency. Published codes focus on
continuous rotations and unitary groups, which generally are not applicable to
systems with strong crystal-field effects. The PointGroupNRG code implements
symmetries related to discrete rotation groups, which are defined by the user
in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, together with particle conservation
and spin rotation symmetries. In this paper we present a new version of the
code that extends the available finite groups, previously limited to simply
reducible point groups, in a way that all point and double groups become
accessible. It also includes the full spin-orbital rotation group. Moreover, to
improve the code's flexibility for impurities with complex interactions, this
new version allows to choose between a standard Anderson Hamiltonian for the
impurity or, as another novel feature, an ionic model that requires only the
spectrum and the impurity Lehmann amplitudes.

| Quantum-like nonlinear interferometry with frequency-engineered
  classical light | Romain Dalidet, Anthony Martin, Grégory Sauder, Laurent Labonté, Sébastien Tanzilli |   Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic
entanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits. Nonlinear
optics has served as a workhorse for the generation of entangled photon pairs,
ensuring both energy and phase conservation, but at the cost of limited rate
and degraded signal-to-noise ratio compared to laser-based interferometry
approaches. We present a \"quantum-like\" nonlinear optical method that reaches
super-resolution in single-photon detection regime. This is achieved by
replacing photon-pairs by coherent states of light, mimicking quantum
properties through classical nonlinear optics processes. Our scheme utilizes
two high-brightness lasers. This results in a substantially greater
signal-to-noise ratio compared to its quantum counterpart. Such an approach
paves the way to significantly reduced acquisition times, providing a pathway
to explore signals across a broader range of bandwidth. The need to increase
the frequency bandwidth of the quantum sensor significantly motivates the
potential applications of this pathway.

survey approach guided by the Job Demands-Resources model. Analysis of
responses from 50 cybersecurity practitioners reveals an alarming reality: 44%
report experiencing severe work-related stress and burnout, while an additional
28% are uncertain about their condition. The demanding nature of cybersecurity
roles, unrealistic expectations, and unsupportive organizational cultures
emerge as primary factors fueling this crisis. Notably, 66% of respondents
perceive cybersecurity jobs as more stressful than other IT positions, with 84%
facing additional challenges due to the pandemic and recent high-profile
breaches. The study finds that most cybersecurity experts are reluctant to
report their struggles to management, perpetuating a cycle of silence and
neglect. To address this critical issue, the paper recommends that
organizations foster supportive work environments, implement mindfulness
programs, and address systemic challenges. By prioritizing the mental health of
cybersecurity professionals, organizations can cultivate a more resilient and
effective workforce to protect against an ever-evolving threat landscape.

| Handling Long-Term Safety and Uncertainty in Safe Reinforcement Learning | Jonas Günster, Puze Liu, Jan Peters, Davide Tateo |   Safety is one of the key issues preventing the deployment of reinforcement
learning techniques in real-world robots. While most approaches in the Safe
Reinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and
robot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them
in complex real-world settings. Instead, model-based approaches that
incorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning
framework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on
the real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot
dynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task-specific and hard
to obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to
compute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long-term safety
requirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe
exploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus
on ensuring long-term safety and handling of uncertainty. Our approach is
competitive or superior to state-of-the-art methods in final performance while
maintaining safer behavior during training.

| Quasiperiodic Floquet-Gibbs states in Rydberg atomic systems | Wilson S. Martins, Federico Carollo, Kay Brandner, Igor Lesanovsky |   Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by
fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an
equilibrium-like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet-Magnus
Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi's golden rule, we show
that such Floquet-Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated
Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab-frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function
of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the
system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which
is necessary to uphold high-lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To
corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five
interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate
numerically that the second-order Floquet-Gibbs state of this system is
essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding
Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently
large.

| Understanding the Effects of the Baidu-ULTR Logging Policy on Two-Tower
  Models | Morris de Haan, Philipp Hager |   Despite the popularity of the two-tower model for unbiased learning to rank
(ULTR) tasks, recent work suggests that it suffers from a major limitation that
could lead to its collapse in industry applications: the problem of logging
policy confounding. Several potential solutions have even been proposed;
however, the evaluation of these methods was mostly conducted using
semi-synthetic simulation experiments. This paper bridges the gap between
theory and practice by investigating the confounding problem on the largest
real-world dataset, Baidu-ULTR. Our main contributions are threefold: 1) we
show that the conditions for the confounding problem are given on Baidu-ULTR,
2) the confounding problem bears no significant effect on the two-tower model,
and 3) we point to a potential mismatch between expert annotations, the golden
standard in ULTR, and user click behavior.

a significant performance drop across various state-of-the-art ASR models when
tested in conversational settings. Furthermore, we observe a correlation
between Word Error Rate and the presence of speech disfluencies, highlighting

| DynaMo: In-Domain Dynamics Pretraining for Visuo-Motor Control | Zichen Jeff Cui, Hengkai Pan, Aadhithya Iyer, Siddhant Haldar, Lerrel Pinto |   Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex
visuomotor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to
thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual
observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual
representations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or
trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present
DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual
representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a
latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of
image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without
augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.
Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet
datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real
environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly
improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised
learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo
hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,
and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and
measure its impact on downstream policy performance. Robot videos are best

  Any Resolution | Peng Wang, Shuai Bai, Sinan Tan, Shijie Wang, Zhihao Fan, Jinze Bai, Keqin Chen, Xuejing Liu, Jialin Wang, Wenbin Ge, Yang Fan, Kai Dang, Mengfei Du, Xuancheng Ren, Rui Men, Dayiheng Liu, Chang Zhou, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin |   We present the Qwen2-VL Series, an advanced upgrade of the previous Qwen-VL
models that redefines the conventional predetermined-resolution approach in
visual processing. Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,
which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions
into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to
generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning
with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary
Position Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional
information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for
processing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception
capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL
investigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By
scaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the
amount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive
performance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to
leading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal
benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models. Code is available at

| Bundle Adjustment in the Eager Mode | Zitong Zhan, Huan Xu, Zihang Fang, Xinpeng Wei, Yaoyu Hu, Chen Wang |   Bundle adjustment (BA) is a critical technique in various robotic
applications, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), augmented
reality (AR), and photogrammetry. BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses
and 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance
of deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to
integrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and
performance. However, widely-used C++-based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,
g$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries
like PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of
debugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we
introduce an eager-mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,
providing PyTorch-compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach
includes GPU-accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for
2nd-order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear
solvers. Our eager-mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency,
achieving an average speedup of 18.5$\times$, 22$\times$, and 23$\times$
compared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.

| Massively Multi-Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context | Felix B Mueller, Julian Tanke, Juergen Gall |   Forecasting long-term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of
human behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input
sequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby
people can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene-aware social
transformer model (SAST) to forecast long-term (10s) human motion motion.
Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely
varying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal
convolutional encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer-based bottleneck
that allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model
the conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We
benchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to
16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously. Our model
outperforms other approaches in terms of realism and diversity on different
metrics and in a user study. Code is available at

| SPECTER: An Instrument Concept for CMB Spectral Distortion Measurements
  with Enhanced Sensitivity | Alina Sabyr, Carlos Sierra, J. Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon |   Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a
perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from
fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\mu$-distortion) to late-time
baryonic feedback processes (y-distortion). While the y-distortion can be
detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude
smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a
serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\mu$
arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the
primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here,
we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly
detecting $\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but
with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we
optimize the instrument's configuration to target $\mu$ while robustly
marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike
Fourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their
individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing
significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion at $\approx 5\sigma$ (10$\sigma$)
assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission
duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized
configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular
resolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally
measure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic
correction at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total
thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.

  Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary-mass
  object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C. Ringqvist, Dorian Demars, Markus Janson, Mickaël Bonnefoy, Yuhiko Aoyama, Gabriel-Dominique Marleau, Catherine Dougados, Judit Szulágyi, Thanawuth Thanathibodee |   Accretion among planets is a poorly understood phenomenon, due to lack of
both observational and theoretical studies. Detection of emission lines from
accreting gas giants facilitate detailed investigations into this process. This
work presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known
young, planetary-mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf
2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7-21 Mj and age 5-45 Myr, located at 45+-2
pc. We obtained the first high-resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target
with VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near-UV to visible wavelengths (3200-6800
AA). We report resolved H3-H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.
Based on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+-1
km/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR
excess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of
the parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+-63 K and radius to 1.5+-0.1
Rj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet-surface shock model
implies a pre-shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,-40) km/s and a pre-shock
density of log(n0/cm^-3)=14(+0,-5). Pre-shock velocity points to a mass of
6(+8,-4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary
Lline-Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of
1.4(+2.8,-0.9)x10^-8 Mj/yr.

from its predecessor, CodeQwen1.5. This series includes two models:
Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B. As a code-specific model,
Qwen2.5-Coder is built upon the Qwen2.5 architecture and continues pretrained
on a vast corpus of over 5.5 trillion tokens. Through meticulous data cleaning,
scalable synthetic data generation, and balanced data mixing, Qwen2.5-Coder
demonstrates impressive code generation capabilities while retaining general
versatility. The model has been evaluated on a wide range of code-related
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across more than 10
benchmarks, including code generation, completion, reasoning, and repair,
consistently outperforming larger models of the same model size. We believe
that the release of the Qwen2.5-Coder series will not only push the boundaries
of research in code intelligence but also, through its permissive licensing,
encourage broader adoption by developers in real-world applications.

| Disruption of a massive molecular cloud by a supernova in the Galactic
  Centre: Initial results from the ACES project | M. Nonhebel, A. T. Barnes, K. Immer, J. Armijos-Abendaño, J. Bally, C. Battersby, M. G. Burton, N. Butterfield, L. Colzi, P. García, A. Ginsburg, J.

Santa-Maria, H. A. Smith, Y. Sofue, M. C. Sormani, V. Tolls, D. L. Walker, Q. D. Wang, G. M. Williams, F. -W. Xu |   The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our
local solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions
it exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong
dynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).
Consequently, it is likely that there are large-scale physical structures
within the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we
present new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a
multi-wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the
M0.8$-$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring-like morphology. We
estimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring to be 79\"
and 154\", respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre
distance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $> 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, a
mass of $\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\odot$, and an expansion speed of $\sim$ 20 km
s$^{-1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($> 10^{51}$ erg) and
momentum ($> 10^7$ M$_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$). We discuss several possible causes
for the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback
and large-scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the
M0.8$-$0.2 ring is a single high-energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain
the observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have
taken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which
we now see as the M0.8$-$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an
extreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.

| To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic
  reasoning | Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett |   Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of
tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted
a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own
evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives
strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with
much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the
answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the
question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic
operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of
CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing
against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic
execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our
results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance
while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond
prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation
across the whole range of LLM applications.

| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs | Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T. Chiu, Siyu Ren, Fei Yuan, Wenting Zhao, Zhiyong Wu, Alexander M. Rush |   Broad textual understanding and in-context learning require language models
that utilize full document contexts. Due to the implementation challenges
associated with directly training long-context models, many methods have been
proposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to
differences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these
approaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long-context
performance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a
controlled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation,
utilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several
insights into long-context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of
perplexity as a general-purpose performance indicator even in longer-context
tasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods
systematically underperform across long-context tasks. Finally, we confirm that
exact fine-tuning based methods are generally effective within the range of
their extension, whereas extrapolation remains challenging. All codebases,
models, and checkpoints will be made available open-source, promoting
transparency and facilitating further research in this critical area of AI
development.

| Finetuning Language Models to Emit Linguistic Expressions of Uncertainty | Arslan Chaudhry, Sridhar Thiagarajan, Dilan Gorur |   Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in information-seeking
and decision-making tasks. Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate
information that conflicts with real-world facts, and their persuasive style
can make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result,
end-users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with
the accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all
outputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore
supervised finetuning on uncertainty-augmented predictions as a method to
develop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty.
Specifically, we measure the calibration of pre-trained models and then
fine-tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of
uncertainty. Through experiments on various question-answering datasets, we
demonstrate that LLMs are well-calibrated in assessing their predictions, and
supervised finetuning based on the model's own confidence leads to
well-calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single-claim
answers.

| Computational Dynamical Systems | Jordan Cotler, Semon Rezchikov |   We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite-dimensional
dynamical systems. Building off of previous work, we give definitions for what
it means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine. We then
show that 'chaotic' dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and
'integrable' dynamical systems (more generally, measure-preserving systems)
cannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines can
be robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, we
show that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable
one-dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and
moreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt.
More broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one 'machine' to simulate
another, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low-complexity 'encoders' and
'decoders' to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system
being simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical
system leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity
theory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.

| Poisson approximate likelihood compared to the particle filter | Yize Hao, Aaron A. Abkemeier, Edward L. Ionides |   Filtering algorithms are fundamental for inference on partially observed
stochastic dynamic systems, since they provide access to the likelihood
function and hence enable likelihood-based or Bayesian inference. A novel
Poisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.
(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering
a fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of
partially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL
is the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large
improvement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,
based on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.
(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should
use PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence
also reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a
shortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that
the comparison of log-likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al. (2023) is
flawed because their PAL calculations were carried out using a dataset scaled
differently from the previous study. If PAL and the particle filter are applied
to the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears. On simulations
where the model is correctly specified, the particle filter outperforms PAL.

  for Text-to-SQL | Hideo Kobayashi, Wuwei Lan, Peng Shi, Shuaichen Chang, Jiang Guo, Henghui Zhu, Zhiguo Wang, Patrick Ng |   While significant progress has been made on the text-to-SQL task, recent
solutions repeatedly encode the same database schema for every question,
resulting in unnecessary high inference cost and often overlooking crucial
database knowledge. To address these issues, we propose You Only Read Once
(YORO), a novel paradigm that directly internalizes database knowledge into the
parametric knowledge of a text-to-SQL model during training and eliminates the
need for schema encoding during inference. YORO significantly reduces the input
token length by 66%-98%. Despite its shorter inputs, our empirical results
demonstrate YORO's competitive performances with traditional systems on three

Furthermore, YORO excels in handling questions with challenging value

unique ergodicity on the IET, we can replace $f$ with any differentiable

IETs instead of just ergodic, we show that the skew products with cocycle given

| multiPI-TransBTS: A Multi-Path Learning Framework for Brain Tumor Image
  Segmentation Based on Multi-Physical Information | Hongjun Zhu, Jiaohang Huang, Kuo Chen, Xuehui Ying, Ying Qian |   Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis,
treatment planning, and monitoring the progression of brain tumors. However,
due to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across
different MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In
this study, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework, multiPI-TransBTS,
which integrates multi-physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.
The model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi-modal
imaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor
characteristics. The multiPI-TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an
Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi-source, multi-scale feature
decoder. The encoder incorporates a multi-branch architecture to separately
extract modality-specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module
fuses information from multiple sources using channel-wise and element-wise
attention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both
common and task-specific features through a Task-Specific Feature Introduction
(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),
Tumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on
the BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of
multiPI-TransBTS over the state-of-the-art methods. The model consistently
achieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,
highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results
also indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision
and recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a
significant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving
clinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.

| Synchrotron self-Compton in a radiative-adiabatic fireball scenario:
  Modelling the multiwavelength observations in some Fermi/LAT bursts | Nissim Fraija, P. Veres, B. Betancourt Kamenetskaia, A. Galvan-Gamez, M. G. Dainotti, Simone Dichiara, R. L. Becerra |   Energetic GeV photons expected from the closest and the most energetic
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provide an unique opportunity to study the
very-high-energy emission as well as the possible correlations with lower
energy bands in realistic GRB afterglow models. In the standard GRB afterglow
model, the relativistic homogeneous shock is usually considered to be fully
adiabatic, however, it could be partially radiative. Based on the external
forward-shock scenario in both stellar wind and constant-density medium. We
present a radiative-adiabatic analytical model of the synchrotron self-Compton
(SSC) and synchrotron processes considering an electron energy distribution
with a power-law index of 1 < p < 2 and 2 $\leq$ p. We show that the SSC
scenario plays a relevant role in the radiative parameter $\epsilon$, leading
to a prolonged evolution during the slow cooling regime. In a particular case,
we derive the Fermi/LAT light curves together with the photons with energies
$\geq$ 100 MeV in a sample of nine bursts from the second Fermi/LAT GRB catalog
that exhibited temporal and spectral indices with $\geq$ 1.5 and $\approx$ 2,
respectively. These events can hardly be described with closure relations of
the standard synchrotron afterglow model, and also exhibit energetic photons
above the synchrotron limit. We have modeled the multi-wavelength observations
of our sample to constrain the microphysical parameters, the circumburst
density, the bulk Lorentz factor and the mechanism responsible for explaining
the energetic GeV photons.

| Blind Deconvolution on Graphs: Exact and Stable Recovery | Chang Ye, Gonzalo Mateos |   We study a blind deconvolution problem on graphs, which arises in the context
of localizing a few sources that diffuse over networks. While the observations
are bilinear functions of the unknown graph filter coefficients and sparse
input signals, a mild requirement on invertibility of the diffusion filter
enables an efficient convex relaxation leading to a linear programming
formulation that can be tackled with off-the-shelf solvers. Under the
Bernoulli-Gaussian model for the inputs, we derive sufficient exact recovery
conditions in the noise-free setting. A stable recovery result is then
established, ensuring the estimation error remains manageable even when the
observations are corrupted by a small amount of noise. Numerical tests with
synthetic and real-world network data illustrate the merits of the proposed
algorithm, its robustness to noise as well as the benefits of leveraging
multiple signals to aid the (blind) localization of sources of diffusion. At a
fundamental level, the results presented here broaden the scope of classical
blind deconvolution of (spatio-)temporal signals to irregular graph domains.

| Generalized compression and compressive search of large datasets | Morgan E. Prior, Thomas Howard III, Emily Light, Najib Ishaq, Noah M. Daniels |   The Big Data explosion has necessitated the development of search algorithms
that scale sub-linearly in time and memory.
  While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently,
few algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain-specific.
  We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to
perform $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search on compressed data while only decompressing
a small, relevant, portion of the data.
  panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low-dimensional
structure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.
  panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between
two points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in
terms of the other.
  This property holds for many widely-used distance functions, e.g. string edit
distances (Levenshtein, Needleman-Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures
(Jaccard, Dice, etc.).
  We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic,
and set data.
  We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the
compressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.
  panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering
sub-linear time performance for $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search.
  We conclude that panCAKES is an efficient, general-purpose algorithm for
exact compressive search on large datasets that obey the manifold hypothesis.
  We provide an open-source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming
language.

| WeHelp: A Shared Autonomy System for Wheelchair Users | Abulikemu Abuduweili, Alice Wu, Tianhao Wei, Weiye Zhao |   There is a large population of wheelchair users. Most of the wheelchair users
need help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs
are not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this
project, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair
users. A robot with a WeHelp system has three modes, following mode, remote
control mode and tele-operation mode. In the following mode, the robot follows
the wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can
ask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the
wheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech
recognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode.
In the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy
stick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs,
such as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high
shelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant
takes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks
for their needs. Our evaluation shows that the pipeline is useful and practical

| Identifying inflated Fermi surfaces via thermoelectric response in
  $d$-wave superconductor heterostructure | Amartya Pal, Paramita Dutta, Arijit Saha |   We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric response of inflated Fermi
surfaces (IFSs) generated in a two dimensional unconventional $d$-wave
superconductor subjected to an external in-plane Zeeman field. These IFSs
exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are
topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the
Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave
superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients
including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and
examine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage
and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of
$d$-wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the
normal-superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric
response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in
Seebeck coefficient ($\sim 200\,\mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($\sim 3.5$) due to the
generation of the IFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for
device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by
computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice-regularized
version of our continuum model.

| JEAN: Joint Expression and Audio-guided NeRF-based Talking Face
  Generation | Sai Tanmay Reddy Chakkera, Aggelina Chatziagapi, Dimitris Samaras |   We introduce a novel method for joint expression and audio-guided talking
face generation. Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker
identity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these
challenges, we propose a NeRF-based network. Since we train our network on
monocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn
disentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio
features in a self-supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects.
By incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned
audio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle
motion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer-based architecture
that learns expression features, capturing long-range facial expressions and
disentangling them from the speech-specific mouth movements. Through
quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-fidelity talking face videos, achieving state-of-the-art facial
expression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.

| Autopet III challenge: Incorporating anatomical knowledge into nnUNet
  for lesion segmentation in PET/CT | Hamza Kalisch, Fabian Hörst, Ken Herrmann, Jens Kleesiek, Constantin Seibold |   Lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging is essential for precise tumor
characterization, which supports personalized treatment planning and enhances
diagnostic precision in oncology. However, accurate manual segmentation of
lesions is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. Given the
rising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods,
particularly deep-learning-based approaches, have become increasingly more
relevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation
of tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting,
addressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable
solutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET
challenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers
(FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers. To this extent, we developed a
classifier that identifies the tracer of the given PET/CT based on the Maximum
Intensity Projection of the PET scan. We trained two individual
nnUNet-ensembles for each tracer where anatomical labels are included as a
multi-label task to enhance the model's performance. Our final submission
achieves cross-validation Dice scores of 76.90% and 61.33% for the publicly
available FDG and PSMA datasets, respectively. The code is available at
https://github.com/hakal104/autoPETIII/ .

| Robots that Learn to Safely Influence via Prediction-Informed
  Reach-Avoid Dynamic Games | Ravi Pandya, Changliu Liu, Andrea Bajcsy |   Robots can influence people to accomplish their tasks more efficiently:
autonomous cars can inch forward at an intersection to pass through, and
tabletop manipulators can go for an object on the table first. However, a
robot's ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if
naively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach-avoid
dynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a
safety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human's behavior
as goal-driven but conditioned on the robot's plan, enabling us to capture
influence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical
and belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in
human behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE
(Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high-dimensional
(39-D) simulated human-robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline
game-theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust
baseline that treats the human as a worst-case adversary, a safety controller
that does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy-function-based
safety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage
the influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing
the robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate
during task execution.

| Decoding Style: Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Image-Guided Outfit
  Recommendation with Preference | Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan |   Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding
both fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper
presents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large
language models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their \"black box\" and static
nature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item
visual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style
and color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis
for personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the
open-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability
to recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative
examples is employed to enhance the LLM's decision-making process. This creates
a self-enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in
line with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore
dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill-in-the-blank,
and complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework's
ability to generate stylish, trend-aligned outfit suggestions, continuously
improving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our
proposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more
cohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the
proposed framework's potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate
suggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit
generation.

| Mechanical Wannier-Stark Ladder of Diamond Spin-Mechanical Lamb Wave
  Resonators | Philip Andrango, Hailin Wang |   We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier-Stark ladders of
diamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with
ultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin
properties. Three nearest-neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric
configurations and a large range of coupling rates have been explored for the
realization of Wannier-Stark ladders of LWRs, potentially enabling long-range
connectivity between spin qubits through their interactions with mechanical
vibrations. Additional analysis on the effects of disorder indicates that the
proposed Wannier-Stark ladder can be robust against realistic experimental
imperfections. The development of mechanical quantum networks of spin qubits
with long-range connectivity can open the door to the implementation of newly
developed quantum low-density parity-check codes in solid-state systems.

| MAgICoRe: Multi-Agent, Iterative, Coarse-to-Fine Refinement for
  Reasoning | Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Archiki Prasad, Swarnadeep Saha, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal |   Large Language Models' (LLM) reasoning can be improved using test-time
aggregation strategies, i.e., generating multiple samples and voting among
generated samples. While these improve performance, they often reach a
saturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated
feedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key
challenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can
over-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and
address errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to
identify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding
how many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too
soon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose
MAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty
as easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard
ones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error
localization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores.
Moreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with
three agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on
step-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure
sufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating
further rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5
and show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of
MAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by
4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with
baselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our
ablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe's RMs and multi-agent
communication.

| Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka |   Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string
processing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into
blocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence
of a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another
occurrence earlier in $T$. Due to numerous applications, LZ77 factorization is
one of the most studied problems on strings. In the 47 years since its
inception, several algorithms were developed for different models of
computation, including parallel, GPU, external-memory, and quantum. Remarkably,
however, the complexity of the most basic variant is still not settled: All
existing algorithms in the RAM model run in $\Omega(n)$ time, which is a
$\Theta(\log n)$ factor away from the lower bound of $\Omega(n/\log n)$
(following from the necessity to read the input, which takes $\Theta(n/\log n)$
space for $T\in\{0,1\}^{n}$).
  We present the first $o(n)$-time algorithm for LZ77 factorization, breaking
the linear-time barrier present for nearly 50 years. For $T\in\{0,1\}^{n}$, our
algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(n/\sqrt{\log n})=o(n)$ time and uses the optimal
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log n)$ working space. Our algorithm generalizes to
$\Sigma=[0..\sigma)$, where $\sigma=n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The runtime and
working space then become $\mathcal{O}((n\log\sigma)/\sqrt{\log n})$ and
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma} n)$. To obtain our algorithm, we prove a more
general result: For any constant $\epsilon\in(0,1)$ and $T\in[0..\sigma)^{n}$,
in $\mathcal{O}((n\log\sigma)/\sqrt{\log n})$ time and using
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma}n)$ space, we can construct an
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma}n)$-size index that, given any $P=T[j..j+\ell)$
(represented as $(j,\ell)$), computes the leftmost occurrence of $P$ in $T$ in
$\mathcal{O}(\log^{\epsilon}n)$ time. In other words, we solve the
indexing/online variant of the LZ77 problem.

  Steer Consumer Behavior Without Detection | Tobias Werner, Ivan Soraperra, Emilio Calvano, David C. Parkes, Iyad Rahwan |   Conversational AI models are becoming increasingly popular and are about to
replace traditional search engines for information retrieval and product
discovery. This raises concerns about monetization strategies and the potential
for subtle consumer manipulation. Companies may have financial incentives to
steer users toward search results or products in a conversation in ways that
are unnoticeable to consumers. Using a behavioral experiment, we show that
conversational AI models can indeed significantly shift consumer preferences.
We discuss implications and ask whether regulators are sufficiently prepared to
combat potential consumer deception.

M. Houff, F. G. Kondev, A. E. Lovell, A. T. Mohan, G. E. Morgan, C. Quick, G. Savard, K. S. Sharma, T. M. Sprouse, L. Varriano |   Atomic masses are a foundational quantity in our understanding of nuclear
structure, astrophysics and fundamental symmetries. The long-standing goal of
creating a predictive global model for the binding energy of a nucleus remains
a significant challenge, however, and prompts the need for precise measurements
of atomic masses to serve as anchor points for model developments. We present
precise mass measurements of neutron-rich Ru and Pd isotopes performed at the
Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade facility at Argonne National
Laboratory using the Canadian Penning Trap mass spectrometer. The masses of
$^{108}$Ru, $^{110}$Ru and $^{116}$Pd were measured to a relative mass
precision $\delta m/m \approx 10^{-8}$ via the phase-imaging
ion-cyclotron-resonance technique, and represent an improvement of
approximately an order of magnitude over previous measurements. These mass data
were used in conjunction with the physically interpretable machine learning
(PIML) model, which uses a mixture density neural network to model mass
excesses via a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The effects of our new mass
data on a Bayesian-updating of a PIML model are presented.

| MoRAG -- Multi-Fusion Retrieval Augmented Generation for Human Motion | Kalakonda Sai Shashank, Shubh Maheshwari, Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla |   We introduce MoRAG, a novel multi-part fusion based retrieval-augmented
generation strategy for text-based human motion generation. The method enhances
motion diffusion models by leveraging additional knowledge obtained through an
improved motion retrieval process. By effectively prompting large language
models (LLMs), we address spelling errors and rephrasing issues in motion
retrieval. Our approach utilizes a multi-part retrieval strategy to improve the
generalizability of motion retrieval across the language space. We create
diverse samples through the spatial composition of the retrieved motions.
Furthermore, by utilizing low-level, part-specific motion information, we can
construct motion samples for unseen text descriptions. Our experiments
demonstrate that our framework can serve as a plug-and-play module, improving
the performance of motion diffusion models. Code, pretrained models and sample

personalized rapid customization has emerged as a significant trend. In this
report, we introduce Takin AudioLLM, a series of techniques and models, mainly
including Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, specifically designed for
audiobook production. These models are capable of zero-shot speech production,
generating high-quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human
speech and facilitating individuals to customize the speech content according
to their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec
language model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a
multi-task training framework, capable of generating high-fidelity natural
speech in a zero-shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and
timbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while
advocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its
naturalness and expressiveness. Last, we propose the Takin Morphing system with
highly decoupled and advanced timbre and prosody modeling approaches, which
enables individuals to customize speech production with their preferred timbre
and prosody in a precise and controllable manner. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness and robustness of our Takin AudioLLM series models.

to sparse computation through expert routing, selectively activating only a
small subset of expert modules. However, sparse computation challenges
traditional training practices, as discrete expert routing hinders standard
backpropagation and thus gradient-based optimization, which are the cornerstone
of deep learning. To better pursue the scaling power of MoE, we introduce GRIN
(GRadient-INformed MoE training), which incorporates sparse gradient estimation
for expert routing and configures model parallelism to avoid token dropping.
Applying GRIN to autoregressive language modeling, we develop a top-2
16$\times$3.8B MoE model. Our model, with only 6.6B activated parameters,
outperforms a 7B dense model and matches the performance of a 14B dense model
trained on the same data. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks
demonstrate the potential of GRIN to significantly enhance MoE efficacy,
achieving 79.4 on MMLU, 83.7 on HellaSwag, 74.4 on HumanEval, and 58.9 on MATH.

| BERT-VBD: Vietnamese Multi-Document Summarization Framework | Tuan-Cuong Vuong, Trang Mai Xuan, Thien Van Luong |   In tackling the challenge of Multi-Document Summarization (MDS), numerous
methods have been proposed, spanning both extractive and abstractive
summarization techniques. However, each approach has its own limitations,
making it less effective to rely solely on either one. An emerging and
promising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractive
summarization methods. Despite the plethora of studies in this domain, research
on the combined methodology remains scarce, particularly in the context of
Vietnamese language processing. This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDS
framework leveraging a two-component pipeline architecture that integrates
extractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs an
extractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This is
achieved by a modification of the pre-trained BERT network, which derives
semantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet network
structures. The second component utilizes the VBD-LLaMA2-7B-50b model for
abstractive summarization, ultimately generating the final summary document.
Our proposed framework demonstrates a positive performance, attaining ROUGE-2
scores of 39.6% on the VN-MDS dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art
baselines.

| Einstein-dilaton-four-Maxwell Holographic Anisotropic Models | Irina Ya. Aref'eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov |   In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the
five-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell models has played a crucial role.
Typically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while
additional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A
more general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field
represents spatial longitudinal-transverse anisotropy, while the third and
fourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We
consider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero
temperature and five functions at non-zero temperature. Maxwell field related
to the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,
whereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.
We demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of
the seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations -- either the
dilaton or the vector potential equation -- follows from the Einstein equations
and the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi
identity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress-energy
tensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is
provided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to
three Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis
shows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein
equations and the equation for the vector potential

| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components
  for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco-Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram |   Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data
together with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal
components used. It is therefore important to determine the number of
significant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a
variational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for
estimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of
samples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This
eliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of
principal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.
This framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows
and columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),
and with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data
with arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as
cultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our
method on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may
underestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the
synthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical
dataset. These results suggest that it is broadly applicable across the life
sciences.

skills without relying on pre-existing language-specific knowledge. The test
covers 894 questions grouped in 160 problems across 75 (mostly) extremely
low-resource languages, extracted from the International Linguistic Olympiad
corpus. To attain high accuracy on this benchmark, models don't need previous
knowledge of the tested language, as all the information needed to solve the
linguistic puzzle is presented in the context. We find that, while all analyzed
models rank below 25% accuracy, there is a significant gap between open and
closed models, with the best-performing proprietary model at 24.05% and the
best-performing open model at 8.84%.

| From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the
  primordial black hole reheating scenario | Guillem Domènech, Jan Tränkle |   We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs
originate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight
PBHs with masses $M\lesssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat
it via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate
whether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH
reheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the
initial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer
functions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and
isocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation
of state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH
dominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the
spectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive
to $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density
fluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance
as a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
observations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the
initial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we
find that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several
future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas,
especially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any
early matter-dominated universe scenario.

| Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules | Anqi Zhang, Wilson S. Geisler |   Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We
investigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented
displays having well-separated potential target-object locations. Performance
was compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption
that the information from the different potential target locations is
statistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than
optimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the
implausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show
that three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical
results. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near
optimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the
central potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise
causes search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These
findings have far-reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks
and other identification tasks in humans and other animals.

| Far-from-equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann
  approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows
  $v_n$ | Vincenzo Nugara, Vincenzo Greco, Salvatore Plumari |   We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal
system in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution
function and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system
sizes $R$ and interaction strength $\eta/s$ and identify universality classes
based upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each
of this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $\hat
\gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results
highlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum
moments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to
a 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of
different sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a
similar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse
flow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system
size and $\eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and
their response functions, along with the impact of the $\eta/s$ and the system
transverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in
momentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow
$v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of
large opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems
evolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play
in this process.

Qwen2.5-Math and Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct-1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the
Qwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self-improvement
throughout the entire pipeline, from pre-training and post-training to
inference: (1) During the pre-training phase, Qwen2-Math-Instruct is utilized
to generate large-scale, high-quality mathematical data. (2) In the
post-training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive
sampling from Qwen2-Math-Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative
evolution of data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model,
it's possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the
next round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the
ultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct.
(3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling,
optimizing the model's performance.
  Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced
mathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics
datasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and
AIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math

| Computing the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two-Dimensional
  Strongly-Correlated Systems | Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn |   We show that the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time-reversal
invariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary-condition
dependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non-interacting and
strongly-correlated insulators. By introducing a family of quasi-single
particle states associated to the many-body ground state of an insulator, we
show that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant can be expressed as the integral of a
certain Berry connection over half the space of boundary conditions, providing
an alternative expression to the formulations that appear in [Lee et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. $\textbf{100}$, 186807 (2008)]. We show the equivalence of the
different many-body formulations of the invariant, and show how they reduce to
known band-theoretic results for Slater determinant ground states. Finally, we
apply our results to analytically calculate the invariant for the Kane-Mele
model with nonlocal (orbital) Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) interactions. This
rigorously establishes the topological nontriviality of the Kane-Mele model
with HK interactions, and represents one of the few exact calculations of the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a strongly-interacting system.

The exposures are obtained in three broadband photometric filters (g, r, i)
using WIYN-ODI. Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a
moment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching
algorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The
measurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight
to obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim
simulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find
the mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We
also find the E-Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic
structures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical
and X-Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to
map large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of
the cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the
peaks are similar to X-Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster
and show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.

| Low Frame-rate Speech Codec: a Codec Designed for Fast High-quality
  Speech LLM Training and Inference | Edresson Casanova, Ryan Langman, Paarth Neekhara, Shehzeen Hussain, Jason Li, Subhankar Ghosh, Ante Jukić, Sang-gil Lee |   Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing
through audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the
application of language modeling techniques to audio data. However, audio
codecs often operate at high frame rates, resulting in slow training and
inference, especially for autoregressive models. To address this challenge, we
present the Low Frame-rate Speech Codec (LFSC): a neural audio codec that
leverages finite scalar quantization and adversarial training with large speech
language models to achieve high-quality audio compression with a 1.89 kbps
bitrate and 21.5 frames per second. We demonstrate that our novel codec can
make the inference of LLM-based text-to-speech models around three times faster
while improving intelligibility and producing quality comparable to previous
models.

| Stronger Baseline Models -- A Key Requirement for Aligning Machine
  Learning Research with Clinical Utility | Nathan Wolfrath, Joel Wolfrath, Hengrui Hu, Anjishnu Banerjee, Anai N. Kothari |   Machine Learning (ML) research has increased substantially in recent years,
due to the success of predictive modeling across diverse application domains.
However, well-known barriers exist when attempting to deploy ML models in
high-stakes, clinical settings, including lack of model transparency (or the
inability to audit the inference process), large training data requirements
with siloed data sources, and complicated metrics for measuring model utility.
In this work, we show empirically that including stronger baseline models in
healthcare ML evaluations has important downstream effects that aid
practitioners in addressing these challenges. Through a series of case studies,
we find that the common practice of omitting baselines or comparing against a
weak baseline model (e.g. a linear model with no optimization) obscures the
value of ML methods proposed in the research literature. Using these insights,
we propose some best practices that will enable practitioners to more
effectively study and deploy ML models in clinical settings.

| Revisiting Dark Photon Constraints from CMB Spectral Distortions | Jens Chluba, Bryce Cyr, Matthew C. Johnson |   Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide
stringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post-BBN (Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models
with COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.
Here, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark
photon conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous
works only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the
change to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon
distortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the
distortion has an opposite sign and a $\simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We
furthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover
the redshift range $\simeq 2\times 10^6-4\times 10^7$ between the $\mu$-era and
the end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints
for dark photon masses in the range $10^{-4}\,{\rm eV}\lesssim m_{\rm
dp}\lesssim 10^{-3}\,{\rm eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We
demonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon
to dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $\mu$-type distortion
independent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study
dark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with
CMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.

| Bi-objective trail-planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous
  environment | Cory M. Simon, Jeffrey Richley, Lucas Overbey, Darleen Perez-Lavin |   Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in
resource delivery, patrolling, information-gathering, agriculture, forest fire
fighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and
search-and-rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments -- with e.g.
rough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or
capturing robots -- should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of
risks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should
take the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the
team-level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward
from visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider
bi-objective trail-planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a
hazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed
graph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of
survival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a
robot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for
the Pareto-optimal robot-team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team
objectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive
the mission. A human decision-maker can then select trail plans that balance,
according to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony
optimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto-optimal set of
robot team trail plans. As a case study, we illustrate with an
information-gathering mission in an art museum.

| Pareto Data Framework: Steps Towards Resource-Efficient Decision Making
  Using Minimum Viable Data (MVD) | Tashfain Ahmed, Josh Siegel |   This paper introduces the Pareto Data Framework, an approach for identifying
and selecting the Minimum Viable Data (MVD) required for enabling machine
learning applications on constrained platforms such as embedded systems, mobile
devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We demonstrate that strategic
data reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing
bandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies
Minimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource-constrained
environments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient
practices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and
overprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for
optimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data
representation. An experimental methodology demonstrates effective acoustic
data characterization after downsampling, quantization, and truncation to
simulate reduced-fidelity sensors and network and storage constraints; results
shows that performance can be maintained up to 95\% with sample rates reduced
by 75\% and bit depths and clip length reduced by 50\% which translates into
substantial cost and resource reduction. These findings have implications on
the design and development of constrained systems. The paper also discusses
broader implications of the framework, including the potential to democratize
advanced AI technologies across IoT applications and sectors such as
agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing to improve access and multiply
the benefits of data-driven insights.

| Applications of Knowledge Distillation in Remote Sensing: A Survey | Yassine Himeur, Nour Aburaed, Omar Elharrouss, Iraklis Varlamis, Shadi Atalla, Wathiq Mansoor, Hussain Al Ahmad |   With the ever-growing complexity of models in the field of remote sensing
(RS), there is an increasing demand for solutions that balance model accuracy
with computational efficiency. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a
powerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,
complex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in
performance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and
its innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer
knowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact
and efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application
across various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and
historical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are
highlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational
efficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical
deployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of
KD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the
breadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case
studies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,
such as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review
discusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical
constraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive
overview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS. Through this
organization, the paper not only elucidates the current state of research in KD
but also sets the stage for future research opportunities, thereby contributing
significantly to both academic research and real-world applications.

| It depends: Varieties of defining growth dependence | Anja Janischewski, Katharina Bohnenberger, Matthias Kranke, Tobias Vogel, Riwan Driouich, Tobias Froese, Stefanie Gerold, Raphael Kaufmann, Lorenz Keyßer, Jannis Niethammer, Christopher Olk, Matthias Schmelzer, Aslı Yürük, Steffen Lange |   Many socio-economic systems require positive economic growth rates to
function properly. Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing
evidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,
these growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,
more and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth-dependent systems
and develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of
'growth dependence' still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,
which impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article
proposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the
concept of 'growth dependence' across socio-economic systems. We provide a
general definition consisting of four components that can be specified for
different empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of
measurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions
or properties of the system under investigation. According to our general
definition, a socio-economic system is growth-dependent if it requires a
long-term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to
maintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen
normative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to
three areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:
employment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies
demonstrate that whether or not a system is growth-dependent hinges not only on
the empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of
the concept of growth dependence. Our framework enables coherent, robust and
effective definitions and research questions, fostering comparability of
findings across different cases and disciplines.

| SPRMamba: Surgical Phase Recognition for Endoscopic Submucosal
  Dissection with Mamba | Xiangning Zhang, Jinnan Chen, Qingwei Zhang, Chengfeng Zhou, Zhengjie Zhang, Xiaobo Li, Dahong Qian |   Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive procedure
initially designed for the treatment of early gastric cancer but is now widely
used for various gastrointestinal lesions. Computer-assisted Surgery systems
have played a crucial role in improving the precision and safety of ESD
procedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognition
of surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesion
characteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real-time
surgical phase recognition algorithms. Existing surgical phase recognition
algorithms struggle to efficiently capture temporal contexts in video-based
scenarios, leading to insufficient performance. To address these issues, we
propose SPRMamba, a novel Mamba-based framework for ESD surgical phase
recognition. SPRMamba leverages the strengths of Mamba for long-term temporal
modeling while introducing the Scaled Residual TranMamba block to enhance the
capture of fine-grained details, overcoming the limitations of traditional
temporal models like Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformers.
Moreover, a Temporal Sample Strategy is introduced to accelerate the
processing, which is essential for real-time phase recognition in clinical
settings. Extensive testing on the ESD385 dataset and the cholecystectomy
Cholec80 dataset demonstrates that SPRMamba surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits greater robustness across various surgical phase
recognition tasks.

data-driven random walk on the symmetric group to obtain a stationary
distribution over player rankings, spanning across different time periods in
sports history. We combine this distribution with a notion of stochastic
dominance to obtain a partial order over the players. We implement our methods
using publicly available data from the Association of Tennis Professionals

| Measuring Human and AI Values based on Generative Psychometrics with
  Large Language Models | Haoran Ye, Yuhang Xie, Yuanyi Ren, Hanjun Fang, Xin Zhang, Guojie Song |   Human values and their measurement are long-standing interdisciplinary
inquiry. Recent advances in AI have sparked renewed interest in this area, with
large language models (LLMs) emerging as both tools and subjects of value
measurement. This work introduces Generative Psychometrics for Values (GPV), an
LLM-based, data-driven value measurement paradigm, theoretically grounded in
text-revealed selective perceptions. We begin by fine-tuning an LLM for
accurate perception-level value measurement and verifying the capability of
LLMs to parse texts into perceptions, forming the core of the GPV pipeline.
Applying GPV to human-authored blogs, we demonstrate its stability, validity,
and superiority over prior psychological tools. Then, extending GPV to LLM
value measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometric
methodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free-form
outputs, enabling context-specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis of
measurement paradigms, indicating response biases of prior methods; and 3) an
attempt to bridge LLM values and their safety, revealing the predictive power
of different value systems and the impacts of various values on LLM safety.
Through interdisciplinary efforts, we aim to leverage AI for next-generation
psychometrics and psychometrics for value-aligned AI.

| FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated
  Long-Tailed Learning | Xiuhua Lu, Peng Li, Xuefeng Jiang |   Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy
in distributed machine learning. However, datasets distributed across each
client in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can
be globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly
affects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated
learning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it
fails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data.
This results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting
the equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a
methodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,
we propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the
local training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred
optimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state-of-the-art
methods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed
distribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10-LT and
CIFAR-100-LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of
model performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long-tailed
distribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.

| Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error
  Detection | Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia |   Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications. Doing
so requires overcoming the noise present on today's hardware. The quantum
approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling
up due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup
over state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems. However,
achieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require
fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant
implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection
code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the
algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with
up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we
propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance, and use it
to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance
to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our
model can be used to determine necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform
Goemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware. Our results demonstrate the
largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially
fault-tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date,
paving the way towards solving real-world applications with quantum computers.

| Cyclicity Analysis of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process | Vivek Kaushik |   In this thesis, we consider an $N$-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)
process satisfying the linear stochastic differential equation $d\mathbf x(t) =
- \mathbf B\mathbf x(t) dt + \boldsymbol \Sigma d \mathbf w(t).$ Here, $\mathbf
B$ is a fixed $N \times N$ circulant friction matrix whose eigenvalues have
positive real parts, $\boldsymbol \Sigma$ is a fixed $N \times M$ matrix. We
consider a signal propagation model governed by this OU process. In this model,
an underlying signal propagates throughout a network consisting of $N$ linked
sensors located in space. We interpret the $n$-th component of the OU process
as the measurement of the propagating effect made by the $n$-th sensor. The
matrix $\mathbf B$ represents the sensor network structure: if $\mathbf B$ has
first row $(b_1 \ , \ \dots \ , \ b_N),$ where $b_1>0$ and $b_2 \ , \ \dots \
,\ b_N \le 0,$ then the magnitude of $b_p$ quantifies how receptive the $n$-th
sensor is to activity within the $(n+p-1)$-th sensor. Finally, the $(m,n)$-th
entry of the matrix $\mathbf D = \frac{\boldsymbol \Sigma \boldsymbol
\Sigma^\text T}{2}$ is the covariance of the component noises injected into the
$m$-th and $n$-th sensors. For different choices of $\mathbf B$ and
$\boldsymbol \Sigma,$ we investigate whether Cyclicity Analysis enables us to
recover the structure of network. Roughly speaking, Cyclicity Analysis studies
the lead-lag dynamics pertaining to the components of a multivariate signal. We
specifically consider an $N \times N$ skew-symmetric matrix $\mathbf Q,$ known
as the lead matrix, in which the sign of its $(m,n)$-th entry captures the
lead-lag relationship between the $m$-th and $n$-th component OU processes. We
investigate whether the structure of the leading eigenvector of $\mathbf Q,$
the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of $\mathbf Q$ in
modulus, reflects the network structure induced by $\mathbf B.$

Our contributions include the design of symmetry-enriched learning models, the
development of advanced optimization techniques leveraging categorical

| Brain-Streams: fMRI-to-Image Reconstruction with Multi-modal Guidance | Jaehoon Joo, Taejin Jeong, Seongjae Hwang |   Understanding how humans process visual information is one of the crucial
steps for unraveling the underlying mechanism of brain activity. Recently, this
curiosity has motivated the fMRI-to-image reconstruction task; given the fMRI
data from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual
stimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent
Diffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex
visual stimuli such as high-resolution natural images from vision datasets.
Despite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often
lack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.
Consequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere
visuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs
effectively incorporate multi-modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,
and image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image
generations. Specifically, inspired by the two-streams hypothesis suggesting
that perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain
regions, our framework, Brain-Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain
regions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from
semantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information
regions, Brain-Streams provides accurate multi-modal guidance to LDMs. We
validate the reconstruction ability of Brain-Streams both quantitatively and
qualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI
data.

| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal
  execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huyên Pham |   Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and
constraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity
markets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general
propagator model under linear functional inequality constraints. The optimal
control is given explicitly in terms of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers
and their conditional expectations, as a solution to a linear stochastic
Fredholm equation. We propose a stochastic version of the Uzawa algorithm on
the dual problem to construct the stochastic Lagrange multipliers numerically
via a stochastic projected gradient ascent, combined with a least-squares Monte
Carlo regression step to approximate their conditional expectations. We
illustrate our findings on two different practical applications with stochastic
signals: (i) an optimal execution problem with an exponential or a power law
decaying transient impact, with either a `no-shorting' constraint in the
presence of a `sell' signal, a `no-buying' constraint in the presence of a
`buy' signal or a stochastic `stop-trading' constraint whenever the exogenous
price drops below a specified reference level; (ii) a battery storage problem
with instantaneous operating costs, seasonal signals and fixed constraints on
both the charging power and the load capacity of the battery.

freelancer profiles by leveraging pre-trained multilingual language models. The
latter are used as backbone for a custom transformer architecture that aims to
keep the structure of the profiles and project. This model is trained with a

that this approach effectively captures skill matching similarity and

| An Efficient Projection-Based Next-best-view Planning Framework for
  Reconstruction of Unknown Objects | Zhizhou Jia, Shaohui Zhang, Qun Hao |   Efficiently and completely capturing the three-dimensional data of an object
is a fundamental problem in industrial and robotic applications. The task of
next-best-view (NBV) planning is to infer the pose of the next viewpoint based
on the current data, and gradually realize the complete three-dimensional
reconstruction. Many existing algorithms, however, suffer a large computational
burden due to the use of ray-casting. To address this, this paper proposes a
projection-based NBV planning framework. It can select the next best view at an
extremely fast speed while ensuring the complete scanning of the object.
Specifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into
ellipsoids based on the voxel structure.Then, the next best view is selected
from the candidate views using a projection-based viewpoint quality evaluation
function in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy. This process
replaces the ray-casting in voxel structures, significantly improving the
computational efficiency. Comparative experiments with other algorithms in a
simulation environment show that the framework proposed in this paper can
achieve 10 times efficiency improvement on the basis of capturing roughly the
same coverage. The real-world experimental results also prove the efficiency
and feasibility of the framework.

| Undersampling effects on observed periods of coronal oscillations | Daye Lim, Tom Van Doorsselaere, Valery M. Nakariakov, Dmitrii Y. Kolotkov, Yuhang Gao, David Berghmans |   Context. Recent observations of decayless transverse oscillations have shown
two branches in the relationship between periods and loop lengths. One is a
linear relationship, interpreted as a standing mode. The other shows almost no
correlation and has not yet been interpreted conclusively. Aims. We
investigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless
oscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely
follow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations
are standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations
where the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase
are randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal
by considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of
telescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast
Fourier transform. Results. When the sampling cadence is getting closer to the
actual oscillation period, a tendency for overestimating periods in short loops
is enhanced. The relationship between loop lengths and periods of the sampled
signals shows the two branches as in the observation. Conclusions. We find that
long periods of decayless oscillations occurring in short loops could be the
result of undersampling.

| Enwrapped Perylene Bisimide Enables Room Temperature Polariton Lasing
  and Photonic Lattices | Dominik Horneber, Johannes Düreth, Tim Schembri, Simon Betzold, Matthias Stolte, Sven Höfling, Frank Würthner, Sebastian Klembt |   Perylene bisimides (PBIs) are organic dyes with photoluminescence quantum
yields (PLQY) close to unity in solution and great thermal and photo-chemical
stability. These features alongside the tunability of their solid-state packing
arrangement via chemical functionalization make this material class an
excellent candidate for exciton-polariton lasing at room temperature. Polariton
lasing is well understood in III-V semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures,
however, the search for emitter materials for robust and versatile room
temperature applications is ongoing. While e.g. perovskites and several organic
materials have been identified to support polariton lasing, many of these
materials lack tunability and long-term stability under ambient conditions.
Here, we fabricate optical microcavities using a strongly enwrapped PBI
chromophore with prevailing monomer-like absorption and emission properties in
the solid state. Voluminous bay-substituents prevent stacking induced
PLQY-quenching, thereby enabling polariton lasing at room temperature.
Additionally, photonic confinement in single hemispheric resonators is
demonstrated leading to localized polaritonic modes with discrete energies, as
well as optical lattices revealing distinct polaritonic band-structures. Due to
the possibility of tunable properties by the precise control of the solid-state
packing arrangement of PBI emitters, our results pave the way for
polarization-dependent light-matter coupling, including topological photonic
effects within oriented crystalline thin-film microcavity structures.

| IMRL: Integrating Visual, Physical, Temporal, and Geometric
  Representations for Enhanced Food Acquisition | Rui Liu, Zahiruddin Mahammad, Amisha Bhaskar, Pratap Tokekar |   Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality
of life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse
food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents
unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric
information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g.,
color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially
when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance.
We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition.
Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy
based on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, such
representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse
acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which
integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance
the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach
captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular,
liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and
introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and
assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies
based on context, improving the robot's capability to handle diverse food
acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach's
robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations,
including zero-shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves
improvement up to $35\%$ in success rate compared with the best-performing
baseline.

| Uncovering liquid-substrate fluctuation effects on crystal growth and
  disordered hyperuniformity of two-dimensional materials | S. K. Mkhonta, Zhi-Feng Huang, K. R. Elder |   We investigate the growth of two-dimensional (2D) crystals on fluctuating
surfaces using a phase field crystal model that is relevant on atomic length
and diffusive time scales. Motivated by recent experiments which achieved
unprecedented fast growth of large-size high-quality 2D crystals on liquid
substrates, we uncover novel effects of liquid surfaces on microstructural
ordering. We find that substrate fluctuations generate short-ranged noise that
speeds up crystallization and grain growth of the overlayer, surpassing that of

modulate local randomness, leading to intriguing disordered structures with
hidden spatial order, i.e., disordered hyperuniformity. These results reveal
the physical mechanisms underlying the fast growth of 2D crystals on liquid

| The Impact of Element Ordering on LM Agent Performance | Wayne Chi, Ameet Talwalkar, Chris Donahue |   There has been a surge of interest in language model agents that can navigate
virtual environments such as the web or desktop. To navigate such environments,
agents benefit from information on the various elements (e.g., buttons, text,
or images) present. It remains unclear which element attributes have the
greatest impact on agent performance, especially in environments that only
provide a graphical representation (i.e., pixels). Here we find that the
ordering in which elements are presented to the language model is surprisingly
impactful--randomizing element ordering in a webpage degrades agent performance
comparably to removing all visible text from an agent's state representation.
While a webpage provides a hierarchical ordering of elements, there is no such
ordering when parsing elements directly from pixels. Moreover, as tasks become
more challenging and models more sophisticated, our experiments suggest that
the impact of ordering increases. Finding an effective ordering is non-trivial.
We investigate the impact of various element ordering methods in web and
desktop environments. We find that dimensionality reduction provides a viable
ordering for pixel-only environments. We train a UI element detection model to
derive elements from pixels and apply our findings to an agent
benchmark--OmniACT--where we only have access to pixels. Our method completes
more than two times as many tasks on average relative to the previous
state-of-the-art.

| Quark saturation in the QCD phase diagram | Marcus Bluhm, Yuki Fujimoto, Larry McLerran, Marlene Nahrgang |   We determine the onset of Quarkyonic Matter corresponding to values of
temperature and baryon chemical potential at which the quark phase space
density becomes one. At zero temperature for baryon chemical potentials below
the mass of the Lambda baryon, only nucleons contribute to the quark density.
This is different at finite temperature, where all baryons, mesons and their
resonances can be excited and thus add quarks to the phase space. The
probability density to find a quark inside a hadron is determined using the
Yukawa ansatz of the IdylliQ model of Quarkyonic Matter. We estimate separately
the magnitude of the various contributions of nucleons, Delta baryons, pions as
well as further hadrons and resonances. The uncertainty in the parametrization
of the probability density to find a quark inside a nucleon is spanned by
assuming that at zero temperature the transition density to Quarkyonic Matter
is between one and three times that of nuclear matter. Various predictions for
a possible critical point associated with the chiral phase transition are found
close to a triple point at which the line of the deconfinement transition and
the curve associated with the transition to Quarkyonic Matter intersect. These
considerations provide an estimate for the region in the QCD phase diagram
where Quarkyonic Matter may be found.

| Towards Interpretable End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Prediction:
  Utilizing Administrative Claims Data with Explainable AI Techniques | Yubo Li, Saba Al-Sayouri, Rema Padman |   This study explores the potential of utilizing administrative claims data,
combined with advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, to
predict the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to End-Stage Renal
Disease (ESRD). We analyze a comprehensive, 10-year dataset provided by a major
health insurance organization to develop prediction models for multiple
observation windows using traditional machine learning methods such as Random
Forest and XGBoost as well as deep learning approaches such as Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) networks. Our findings demonstrate that the LSTM model,
particularly with a 24-month observation window, exhibits superior performance
in predicting ESRD progression, outperforming existing models in the
literature. We further apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to
enhance interpretability, providing insights into the impact of individual
features on predictions at the individual patient level. This study underscores
the value of leveraging administrative claims data for CKD management and
predicting ESRD progression.

| Unveiling the Secrets of New Physics Through Top Quark Tagging | Rameswar Sahu, Saiyad Ashanujjaman, Kirtiman Ghosh |   The ubiquity of top-rich final states in the context of beyond the Standard
Model (BSM) searches has led to their status as extensively studied signatures
at the LHC. Over the past decade, numerous endeavours have been undertaken in
the literature to develop methods for efficiently distinguishing boosted top
quark jets from QCD jets. Although cut-based strategies for boosted top
tagging, which rely on substructure information from fat jets resulting from
the hadronic decay of boosted top quarks, were introduced in the literature as
early as 2008, recent years have witnessed a surge in the utilization of
machine learning-based approaches for the classification of top-jets from QCD
jets. The review focuses on the present status of boosted top tagging and its
application for BSM searchers.

| The $η_c$-meson leading-twist distribution amplitude | Benoît Blossier, Mariane Mangin-Brinet, José Manuel Morgado Chávez, Teseo San José |   In this project, we employ the short-distance factorization to compute the
distribution amplitude of the $\eta_c$-meson from Lattice QCD at leading twist.
We employ a set of CLS $N_f=2$ ensembles at three lattice spacings and various
quark masses to extrapolate the pseudo distribution to the physical point in
the isospin limit. We solve the inverse problem modeling the distribution
amplitude, and we match our results to the light-cone in the
$\overline{\text{MS}}$-scheme. We include a complete error budget, and we
compare to two alternative approaches: non-relativistic QCD and Dyson-Schwinger
equations, finding good agreement with the latter but not with the former.

following doubly degenerate chemotaxis-consumption system \begin{align*}
\left\{ \begin{array}{r@{\,}l@{\quad}l@{\,}c}
&u_{t}=\nabla\cdot\big(u^{m-1}v\nabla v\big)-\nabla\cdot\big(f(u)v\nabla

no-flux boundary conditions in a smoothly bounded convex domain $\Omega\subset
\R^2$, where the nonnegative function $f\in C^1([0,\infty))$ is asked to
satisfy $f(s)\le C_fs^{\al}$ with $\al, C_f>0$ for all $s\ge 1$.
  The global existence of weak solutions or classical solutions to the above
system has been established in both one- and two-dimensional bounded convex
domains in previous works. However, the results concerning the large time
behavior are still constrained to one dimension due to the lack of a
Harnack-type inequality in the two-dimensional case. In this note, we
complement this result by using the Moser iteration technique and building a

| ReLU Surrogates in Mixed-Integer MPC for Irrigation Scheduling | Bernard T. Agyeman, Jinfeng Liu, Sirish L. Shah |   Efficient water management in agriculture is important for mitigating the
growing freshwater scarcity crisis. Mixed-integer Model Predictive Control
(MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex
scheduling problems in agricultural irrigation. However, the computational
complexity of mixed-integer MPC still poses a significant challenge,
particularly in large-scale applications. This study proposes an approach to
enhance the computational efficiency of mixed-integer MPC-based irrigation
schedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture
dynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed-integer linear
representation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the
mixed-integer MPC-based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a
mixed-integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed-integer
nonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global
optimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated
through comparative studies conducted on a large-scale agricultural field
across two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models,
specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used
triggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU-based approach significantly
reduces solution times -- by up to 99.5\% -- while achieving comparable
performance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water
Use Efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, the ReLU-based approach maintains enhanced
performance in terms of total prescribed irrigation and IWUE compared to the
widely-used triggered irrigation scheduling method.

| Design of Ligand-Binding Proteins with Atomic Flow Matching | Junqi Liu, Shaoning Li, Chence Shi, Zhi Yang, Jian Tang |   Designing novel proteins that bind to small molecules is a long-standing
challenge in computational biology, with applications in developing catalysts,
biosensors, and more. Current computational methods rely on the assumption that
the binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible,
as conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon
binding. In this work, we formulate proteins and molecules as unified
biotokens, and present AtomFlow, a novel deep generative model under the
flow-matching framework for the design of ligand-binding proteins from the 2D
target molecular graph alone. Operating on representative atoms of biotokens,
AtomFlow captures the flexibility of ligands and generates ligand conformations
and protein backbone structures iteratively. We consider the multi-scale nature
of biotokens and demonstrate that AtomFlow can be effectively trained on a
subset of structures from the Protein Data Bank, by matching flow vector field
using an SE(3) equivariant structure prediction network. Experimental results
show that our method can generate high fidelity ligand-binding proteins and
achieve performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model RFDiffusionAA,
while not requiring bound ligand structures. As a general framework, AtomFlow
holds the potential to be applied to various biomolecule generation tasks in
the future.

| Denoising diffusion models for high-resolution microscopy image
  restoration | Pamela Osuna-Vargas, Maren H. Wehrheim, Lucas Zinz, Johanna Rahm, Ashwin Balakrishnan, Alexandra Kaminer, Mike Heilemann, Matthias Kaschube |   Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at
the nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological
organization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of
fluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses
remain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced
laser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and
increased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high-resolution
images by conditioning the model on low-resolution information. Additionally,
the probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images
that tend to further increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We show that our model
achieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously
best-performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly,
while any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but
not all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all
four data sets, suggesting high generalizability.

| Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Via Data Pruning | Andrea Napoli, Paul White |   The removal of carefully-selected examples from training data has recently
emerged as an effective way of improving the robustness of machine learning
models. However, the best way to select these examples remains an open
question. In this paper, we consider the problem from the perspective of
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). We propose AdaPrune, a method for UDA
whereby training examples are removed to attempt to align the training
distribution to that of the target data. By adopting the maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) as the criterion for alignment, the problem can be neatly
formulated and solved as an integer quadratic program. We evaluate our approach
on a real-world domain shift task of bioacoustic event detection. As a method
for UDA, we show that AdaPrune outperforms related techniques, and is
complementary to other UDA algorithms such as CORAL. Our analysis of the
relationship between the MMD and model accuracy, along with t-SNE plots,
validate the proposed method as a principled and well-founded way of performing
data pruning.

| The elastica sling | Alessandro Cazzolli, Francesco Dal Corso |   The nonlinear mechanics of a flexible elastic rod constrained at its edges by
a pair of sliding sleeves is analyzed. The planar equilibrium configurations of
this variable-length elastica are found to have shape defined only by the
inclination of the two constraints, while their distance is responsible only
for scaling the size. By extending the theoretical stability criterion
available for systems under isoperimetric constraints to the case of variable
domains, the existence of no more than one stable equilibrium solution is
revealed. The set of sliding sleeves' inclination pairs for which the stability
is lost are identified. Such critical conditions allow the indefinite ejection
of the flexible rod from the sliding sleeves, thus realizing an elastica sling.
Finally, the theoretical findings are validated by experiments on a physical
prototype. The present results lead to a novel actuation principle that may
find application as a mechanism in energy harvesting, wave mitigation devices,
and soft robotic locomotion.

| Online Refractive Camera Model Calibration in Visual Inertial Odometry | Mohit Singh, Kostas Alexis |   This paper presents a general refractive camera model and online
co-estimation of odometry and the refractive index of unknown media. This
enables operation in diverse and varying refractive fluids, given only the
camera calibration in air. The refractive index is estimated online as a state
variable of a monocular visual-inertial odometry framework in an iterative
formulation using the proposed camera model. The method was verified on data
collected using an underwater robot traversing inside a pool. The evaluations
demonstrate convergence to the ideal refractive index for water despite
significant perturbations in the initialization. Simultaneously, the approach
enables on-par visual-inertial odometry performance in refractive media without
prior knowledge of the refractive index or requirement of medium-specific
camera calibration.

| Influence of dislocations in multilayer graphene stacks: A phase field
  crystal study | K. R. Elder, Zhi-Feng Huang, T. Ala-Nissila |   In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene
stacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a
recently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems
incorporating out-of-plane deformations and parameterized to match to density
functional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems. The
specific configuration considered consists of one monolayer containing four
$5|7$ dislocations (i.e., two dislocation dipoles) sandwiched in between
perfect graphene layers. The study reveals how the strain field from the
dislocations in the defected layer leads to out-of-plane deformations that in
turn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are
made for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a
defect-free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and
system size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by
roughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence
across the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height
profiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.

| PAD-FT: A Lightweight Defense for Backdoor Attacks via Data Purification
  and Fine-Tuning | Yukai Xu, Yujie Gu, Kouichi Sakurai |   Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks,
particularly as recent advancements have led to increasingly subtle
implantation, making the defense more challenging. Existing defense mechanisms
typically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and
involve retraining an auxiliary model or fine-tuning the entire victim model.
However, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always
feasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and
lightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD-FT, that does not require an
additional clean dataset and fine-tunes only a very small part of the model to
disinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a
simple data purification process to identify and select the most-likely clean
data from the poisoned training dataset. The self-purified clean dataset is
then used for activation clipping and fine-tuning only the last classification
layer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation
clipping, and classifier fine-tuning, our mechanism PAD-FT demonstrates
superior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as
confirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.

| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing
  data in Irish sagas | P. MacCarron |   For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts
in order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify
similarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the
significance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture
requires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and
often impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the
network of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that
the top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent
with central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has
been lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust
to a large random removal of edges.

| The repetition threshold for ternary rich words | James D. Currie, Lucas Mol, Jarkko Peltomäki |   In 2014, Vesti proposed the problem of determining the repetition threshold
for infinite rich words, i.e., for infinite words in which all factors of

Mol, and Rampersad proved a conjecture of Baranwal and Shallit that the
repetition threshold for binary rich words is $2 + \sqrt{2}/2$. In this paper,
we prove a structure theorem for $16/7$-power-free ternary rich words. Using
the structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich
words is $1 + 1/(3 - \mu) \approx 2.25876324$, where $\mu$ is the unique real
root of the polynomial $x^3 - 2x^2 - 1$.

| Fitting Multilevel Factor Models | Tetiana Parshakova, Trevor Hastie, Stephen Boyd |   We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance
given by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~\cite{parshakova2023factor}. We
develop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of
the observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and
maintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved
through a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive
definite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of an invertible PSD MLR matrix
is also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the
recursive Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of
the inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky
factorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities,
yielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement. This paper is
accompanied by an open-source package that implements the proposed methods.

| Drifts of the sub-stellar points of the TRAPPIST-1 planets | Revol Alexandre, Émeline Bolmont, Mariana Sastre, Gabriel Tobie, Anne-Sophie Libert, Mathilde Kervazo, Sergi Blanco-Cuaresma |   Accurate modeling of tidal interactions is crucial for interpreting recent
JWST observations of the thermal emissions of TRAPPIST-1~b and c and for
characterizing the surface conditions and potential habitability of the other
planets in the system. Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by
tidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to
their proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the
TRAPPIST-1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In
this work, we present the recent implementation of the co-planar tidal torque
and forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N-body code
Posidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using
a tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of
each planet by taking into account their multi-layer internal structure
computed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets
are not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state.
Planet-planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and
tides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a
result, the sub-stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and
long-timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with
periods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.

| Quantum Magic and Multi-Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei | Florian Brökemeier, S. Momme Hengstenberg, James W. T. Keeble, Caroline E. P. Robin, Federico Rocco, Martin J. Savage |   Motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the
quantum complexity of $p$-shell and $sd$-shell nuclei. Valence-space nuclear
shell-model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit
registers using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$-shell and 24
qubits for the $sd$-shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement
($n$-tangles) and magic (non-stabilizerness) are determined. While exact
evaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of
active nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex
nuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique
is introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed
nuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\sim 8$ for some
nuclei. Significant multi-nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$-shell,
dominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of
magic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on
the path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion.
These results indicate that quantum-computing resources will accelerate
precision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.

| Post-Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a
  massive, rotating object | Lorenzo Iorio |   The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the
general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring
components of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are
analytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level. To the Newtonian
order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as
well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation
in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the
primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first
to 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system
along an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred
close to the Sun's flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due
to the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of
microarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for
the post-Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)
spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of
the latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current
(formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would
bring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the
predicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not
changed by any of the post--Keplerian accelerations considered. The
calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any
alternative models of gravity as well.

| Generalized Robot Learning Framework | Jiahuan Yan, Zhouyang Hong, Yu Zhao, Yu Tian, Yunxin Liu, Travis Davies, Luhui Hu |   Imitation based robot learning has recently gained significant attention in
the robotics field due to its theoretical potential for transferability and
generalizability. However, it remains notoriously costly, both in terms of
hardware and data collection, and deploying it in real-world environments
demands meticulous setup of robots and precise experimental conditions. In this
paper, we present a low-cost robot learning framework that is both easily
reproducible and transferable to various robots and environments. We
demonstrate that deployable imitation learning can be successfully applied even
to industrial-grade robots, not just expensive collaborative robotic arms.
Furthermore, our results show that multi-task robot learning is achievable with
simple network architectures and fewer demonstrations than previously thought
necessary. As the current evaluating method is almost subjective when it comes
to real-world manipulation tasks, we propose Voting Positive Rate (VPR) - a
novel evaluation strategy that provides a more objective assessment of
performance. We conduct an extensive comparison of success rates across various
self-designed tasks to validate our approach. To foster collaboration and
support the robot learning community, we have open-sourced all relevant
datasets and model checkpoints, available at huggingface.co/ZhiChengAI.

we release paraphrasus, a benchmark designed for multi-dimensional assessment

but may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have
been several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but
most of them are not data-driven or training-based. In this paper, we are
motivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel
model architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts
and then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines
to annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt-response samples, then
add language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We
train the language model by the thoughts-augmented data and successfully let
the thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally
output more reasonable responses. Both qualitative examples and quantitative
results validate the effectiveness and performance of TaS. Our code is

| Artemis: Efficient Commit-and-Prove SNARKs for zkML | Hidde Lycklama, Alexander Viand, Nikolay Avramov, Nicolas Küchler, Anwar Hithnawi |   The widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) in various critical
applications, from healthcare to autonomous systems, has raised significant
concerns about privacy, accountability, and trustworthiness. To address these
concerns, recent research has focused on developing zero-knowledge machine
learning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of
ML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have
substantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily
optimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the
substantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the
model and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new
Commit-and-Prove SNARK (CP-SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that
effectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML
pipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white-box use of the
underlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic
polynomial commitment and only makes black-box use of the proof system. As a
result, Artemis is compatible with state-of-the-art proof systems without
trusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP-SNARKs, evaluate
their performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial
improvements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover
costs and maintaining efficiency even for large-scale models. For example, for
the VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from
11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML
towards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and
complex ML models.

Enriques variety with canonical singularities. Finally, we investigate the

in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, together with particle conservation
and spin rotation symmetries. In this paper we present a new version of the
code that extends the available finite groups, previously limited to simply
reducible point groups, in a way that all point and double groups become
accessible. It also includes the full spin-orbital rotation group. Moreover, to
improve the code's flexibility for impurities with complex interactions, this
new version allows to choose between a standard Anderson Hamiltonian for the
impurity or, as another novel feature, an ionic model that requires only the
spectrum and the impurity Lehmann amplitudes.

| Quantum-like nonlinear interferometry with frequency-engineered
  classical light | Romain Dalidet, Anthony Martin, Grégory Sauder, Laurent Labonté, Sébastien Tanzilli |   Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic
entanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits. Nonlinear
optics has served as a workhorse for the generation of entangled photon pairs,
ensuring both energy and phase conservation, but at the cost of limited rate
and degraded signal-to-noise ratio compared to laser-based interferometry
approaches. We present a \"quantum-like\" nonlinear optical method that reaches
super-resolution in single-photon detection regime. This is achieved by
replacing photon-pairs by coherent states of light, mimicking quantum
properties through classical nonlinear optics processes. Our scheme utilizes
two high-brightness lasers. This results in a substantially greater
signal-to-noise ratio compared to its quantum counterpart. Such an approach
paves the way to significantly reduced acquisition times, providing a pathway
to explore signals across a broader range of bandwidth. The need to increase
the frequency bandwidth of the quantum sensor significantly motivates the
potential applications of this pathway.

| A Survey-Based Quantitative Analysis of Stress Factors and Their Impacts
  Among Cybersecurity Professionals | Sunil Arora, John D. Hastings |   This study investigates the prevalence and underlying causes of work-related
stress and burnout among cybersecurity professionals using a quantitative
survey approach guided by the Job Demands-Resources model. Analysis of
responses from 50 cybersecurity practitioners reveals an alarming reality: 44%
report experiencing severe work-related stress and burnout, while an additional
28% are uncertain about their condition. The demanding nature of cybersecurity
roles, unrealistic expectations, and unsupportive organizational cultures
emerge as primary factors fueling this crisis. Notably, 66% of respondents
perceive cybersecurity jobs as more stressful than other IT positions, with 84%
facing additional challenges due to the pandemic and recent high-profile
breaches. The study finds that most cybersecurity experts are reluctant to
report their struggles to management, perpetuating a cycle of silence and
neglect. To address this critical issue, the paper recommends that
organizations foster supportive work environments, implement mindfulness
programs, and address systemic challenges. By prioritizing the mental health of
cybersecurity professionals, organizations can cultivate a more resilient and
effective workforce to protect against an ever-evolving threat landscape.

| Using Large Language Models to Generate Clinical Trial Tables and
  Figures | Yumeng Yang, Peter Krusche, Kristyn Pantoja, Cheng Shi, Ethan Ludmir, Kirk Roberts, Gen Zhu |   Tables, figures, and listings (TFLs) are essential tools for summarizing
clinical trial data. Creation of TFLs for reporting activities is often a
time-consuming task encountered routinely during the execution of clinical
trials. This study explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate
the generation of TFLs through prompt engineering and few-shot transfer
learning. Using public clinical trial data in ADaM format, our results
demonstrated that LLMs can efficiently generate TFLs with prompt instructions,
showcasing their potential in this domain. Furthermore, we developed a
conservational agent named Clinical Trial TFL Generation Agent: An app that
matches user queries to predefined prompts that produce customized programs to
generate specific predefined TFLs.

| Handling Long-Term Safety and Uncertainty in Safe Reinforcement Learning | Jonas Günster, Puze Liu, Jan Peters, Davide Tateo |   Safety is one of the key issues preventing the deployment of reinforcement
learning techniques in real-world robots. While most approaches in the Safe
Reinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and
robot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them
in complex real-world settings. Instead, model-based approaches that
incorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning
framework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on
the real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot
dynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task-specific and hard
to obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to
compute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long-term safety
requirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe
exploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus
on ensuring long-term safety and handling of uncertainty. Our approach is
competitive or superior to state-of-the-art methods in final performance while
maintaining safer behavior during training.

| Quasiperiodic Floquet-Gibbs states in Rydberg atomic systems | Wilson S. Martins, Federico Carollo, Kay Brandner, Igor Lesanovsky |   Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by
fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an
equilibrium-like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet-Magnus
Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi's golden rule, we show
that such Floquet-Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated
Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab-frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function
of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the
system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which
is necessary to uphold high-lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To
corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five
interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate
numerically that the second-order Floquet-Gibbs state of this system is
essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding
Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently
large.

| Understanding the Effects of the Baidu-ULTR Logging Policy on Two-Tower
  Models | Morris de Haan, Philipp Hager |   Despite the popularity of the two-tower model for unbiased learning to rank
(ULTR) tasks, recent work suggests that it suffers from a major limitation that
could lead to its collapse in industry applications: the problem of logging
policy confounding. Several potential solutions have even been proposed;
however, the evaluation of these methods was mostly conducted using
semi-synthetic simulation experiments. This paper bridges the gap between
theory and practice by investigating the confounding problem on the largest
real-world dataset, Baidu-ULTR. Our main contributions are threefold: 1) we
show that the conditions for the confounding problem are given on Baidu-ULTR,
2) the confounding problem bears no significant effect on the two-tower model,
and 3) we point to a potential mismatch between expert annotations, the golden
standard in ULTR, and user click behavior.

| ASR Benchmarking: Need for a More Representative Conversational Dataset | Gaurav Maheshwari, Dmitry Ivanov, Théo Johannet, Kevin El Haddad |   Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable
performance on widely used benchmarks such as LibriSpeech and Fleurs. However,
these benchmarks do not adequately reflect the complexities of real-world
conversational environments, where speech is often unstructured and contains
disfluencies such as pauses, interruptions, and diverse accents. In this study,
we introduce a multilingual conversational dataset, derived from TalkBank,
consisting of unstructured phone conversation between adults. Our results show
a significant performance drop across various state-of-the-art ASR models when
tested in conversational settings. Furthermore, we observe a correlation
between Word Error Rate and the presence of speech disfluencies, highlighting
the critical need for more realistic, conversational ASR benchmarks.

| DynaMo: In-Domain Dynamics Pretraining for Visuo-Motor Control | Zichen Jeff Cui, Hengkai Pan, Aadhithya Iyer, Siddhant Haldar, Lerrel Pinto |   Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex
visuomotor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to
thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual
observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual
representations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or
trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present
DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual
representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a
latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of
image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without
augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.
Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet
datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real
environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly
improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised
learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo
hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,
and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and
measure its impact on downstream policy performance. Robot videos are best

models that redefines the conventional predetermined-resolution approach in
visual processing. Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,
which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions
into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to
generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning
with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary
Position Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional
information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for
processing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception
capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL
investigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By
scaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the
amount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive
performance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to
leading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal
benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models. Code is available at

| Bundle Adjustment in the Eager Mode | Zitong Zhan, Huan Xu, Zihang Fang, Xinpeng Wei, Yaoyu Hu, Chen Wang |   Bundle adjustment (BA) is a critical technique in various robotic
applications, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), augmented
reality (AR), and photogrammetry. BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses
and 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance
of deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to
integrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and
performance. However, widely-used C++-based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,
g$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries
like PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of
debugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we
introduce an eager-mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,
providing PyTorch-compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach
includes GPU-accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for
2nd-order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear
solvers. Our eager-mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency,
achieving an average speedup of 18.5$\times$, 22$\times$, and 23$\times$
compared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.

| Massively Multi-Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context | Felix B Mueller, Julian Tanke, Juergen Gall |   Forecasting long-term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of
human behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input
sequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby
people can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene-aware social
transformer model (SAST) to forecast long-term (10s) human motion motion.
Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely
varying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal
convolutional encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer-based bottleneck
that allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model
the conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We
benchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to
16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously. Our model
outperforms other approaches in terms of realism and diversity on different
metrics and in a user study. Code is available at

| SPECTER: An Instrument Concept for CMB Spectral Distortion Measurements
  with Enhanced Sensitivity | Alina Sabyr, Carlos Sierra, J. Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon |   Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a
perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from
fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\mu$-distortion) to late-time
baryonic feedback processes (y-distortion). While the y-distortion can be
detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude
smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a
serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\mu$
arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the
primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here,
we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly
detecting $\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but
with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we
optimize the instrument's configuration to target $\mu$ while robustly
marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike
Fourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their
individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing
significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion at $\approx 5\sigma$ (10$\sigma$)
assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission
duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized
configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular
resolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally
measure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic
correction at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total
thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.

  Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary-mass

Ringqvist, Dorian Demars, Markus Janson, Mickaël Bonnefoy, Yuhiko Aoyama, Gabriel-Dominique Marleau, Catherine Dougados, Judit Szulágyi, Thanawuth Thanathibodee |   Accretion among planets is a poorly understood phenomenon, due to lack of
both observational and theoretical studies. Detection of emission lines from
accreting gas giants facilitate detailed investigations into this process. This
work presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known
young, planetary-mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf
2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7-21 Mj and age 5-45 Myr, located at 45+-2
pc. We obtained the first high-resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target
with VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near-UV to visible wavelengths (3200-6800
AA). We report resolved H3-H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.
Based on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+-1
km/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR
excess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of
the parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+-63 K and radius to 1.5+-0.1
Rj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet-surface shock model
implies a pre-shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,-40) km/s and a pre-shock
density of log(n0/cm^-3)=14(+0,-5). Pre-shock velocity points to a mass of
6(+8,-4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary
Lline-Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of
1.4(+2.8,-0.9)x10^-8 Mj/yr.

from its predecessor, CodeQwen1.5. This series includes two models:
Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B. As a code-specific model,
Qwen2.5-Coder is built upon the Qwen2.5 architecture and continues pretrained
on a vast corpus of over 5.5 trillion tokens. Through meticulous data cleaning,
scalable synthetic data generation, and balanced data mixing, Qwen2.5-Coder
demonstrates impressive code generation capabilities while retaining general
versatility. The model has been evaluated on a wide range of code-related
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across more than 10
benchmarks, including code generation, completion, reasoning, and repair,
consistently outperforming larger models of the same model size. We believe
that the release of the Qwen2.5-Coder series will not only push the boundaries
of research in code intelligence but also, through its permissive licensing,
encourage broader adoption by developers in real-world applications.

Santa-Maria, H. A. Smith, Y. Sofue, M. C. Sormani, V. Tolls, D. L. Walker, Q. D. Wang, G. M. Williams, F. -W. Xu |   The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our
local solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions
it exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong
dynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).
Consequently, it is likely that there are large-scale physical structures
within the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we
present new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a
multi-wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the
M0.8$-$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring-like morphology. We
estimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring to be 79\"
and 154\", respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre
distance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $> 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, a
mass of $\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\odot$, and an expansion speed of $\sim$ 20 km
s$^{-1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($> 10^{51}$ erg) and
momentum ($> 10^7$ M$_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$). We discuss several possible causes
for the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback
and large-scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the
M0.8$-$0.2 ring is a single high-energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain
the observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have
taken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which
we now see as the M0.8$-$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an
extreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.

  reasoning | Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett |   Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of
tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted
a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own
evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives
strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with
much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the
answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the
question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic
operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of
CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing
against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic
execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our
results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance
while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond
prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation
across the whole range of LLM applications.

| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs | Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T. Chiu, Siyu Ren, Fei Yuan, Wenting Zhao, Zhiyong Wu, Alexander M. Rush |   Broad textual understanding and in-context learning require language models
that utilize full document contexts. Due to the implementation challenges
associated with directly training long-context models, many methods have been
proposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to
differences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these
approaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long-context
performance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a
controlled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation,
utilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several
insights into long-context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of
perplexity as a general-purpose performance indicator even in longer-context
tasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods
systematically underperform across long-context tasks. Finally, we confirm that
exact fine-tuning based methods are generally effective within the range of
their extension, whereas extrapolation remains challenging. All codebases,
models, and checkpoints will be made available open-source, promoting
transparency and facilitating further research in this critical area of AI

| Finetuning Language Models to Emit Linguistic Expressions of Uncertainty | Arslan Chaudhry, Sridhar Thiagarajan, Dilan Gorur |   Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in information-seeking
and decision-making tasks. Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate
information that conflicts with real-world facts, and their persuasive style
can make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result,
end-users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with
the accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all
outputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore
supervised finetuning on uncertainty-augmented predictions as a method to
develop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty.
Specifically, we measure the calibration of pre-trained models and then
fine-tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of
uncertainty. Through experiments on various question-answering datasets, we
demonstrate that LLMs are well-calibrated in assessing their predictions, and
supervised finetuning based on the model's own confidence leads to
well-calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single-claim
answers.

| Computational Dynamical Systems | Jordan Cotler, Semon Rezchikov |   We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite-dimensional
dynamical systems. Building off of previous work, we give definitions for what
it means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine. We then
show that 'chaotic' dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and
'integrable' dynamical systems (more generally, measure-preserving systems)
cannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines can
be robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, we
show that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable
one-dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and
moreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt.
More broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one 'machine' to simulate
another, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low-complexity 'encoders' and
'decoders' to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system
being simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical
system leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity
theory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.

| Poisson approximate likelihood compared to the particle filter | Yize Hao, Aaron A. Abkemeier, Edward L. Ionides |   Filtering algorithms are fundamental for inference on partially observed
stochastic dynamic systems, since they provide access to the likelihood
function and hence enable likelihood-based or Bayesian inference. A novel
Poisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.
(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering
a fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of
partially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL
is the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large
improvement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,
based on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.
(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should
use PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence
also reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a
shortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that
the comparison of log-likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al. (2023) is
flawed because their PAL calculations were carried out using a dataset scaled
differently from the previous study. If PAL and the particle filter are applied
to the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears. On simulations
where the model is correctly specified, the particle filter outperforms PAL.

Furthermore, YORO excels in handling questions with challenging value

| Ergodic properties of infinite extension of symmetric interval exchange
  transformations | Przemysław Berk, Frank Trujillo, Hao Wu |   We prove that skew products with the cocycle given by the function
$f(x)=a(x-1/2)$ with $a\neq 0$ are ergodic for every ergodic symmetric IET in
the base, thus giving the full characterization of ergodic extensions in this
family. Moreover, we prove that under an additional natural assumption of
unique ergodicity on the IET, we can replace $f$ with any differentiable
function with a non-zero sum of jumps. Finally, by considering weakly mixing
IETs instead of just ergodic, we show that the skew products with cocycle given
by $f$ have infinite ergodic index.

| multiPI-TransBTS: A Multi-Path Learning Framework for Brain Tumor Image
  Segmentation Based on Multi-Physical Information | Hongjun Zhu, Jiaohang Huang, Kuo Chen, Xuehui Ying, Ying Qian |   Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis,
treatment planning, and monitoring the progression of brain tumors. However,
due to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across
different MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In
this study, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework, multiPI-TransBTS,
which integrates multi-physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.
The model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi-modal
imaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor
characteristics. The multiPI-TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an
Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi-source, multi-scale feature
decoder. The encoder incorporates a multi-branch architecture to separately
extract modality-specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module
fuses information from multiple sources using channel-wise and element-wise
attention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both
common and task-specific features through a Task-Specific Feature Introduction
(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),
Tumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on
the BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of
multiPI-TransBTS over the state-of-the-art methods. The model consistently
achieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,
highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results
also indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision
and recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a
significant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving
clinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.

| Synchrotron self-Compton in a radiative-adiabatic fireball scenario:
  Modelling the multiwavelength observations in some Fermi/LAT bursts | Nissim Fraija, P. Veres, B. Betancourt Kamenetskaia, A. Galvan-Gamez, M. G. Dainotti, Simone Dichiara, R. L. Becerra |   Energetic GeV photons expected from the closest and the most energetic
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provide an unique opportunity to study the
very-high-energy emission as well as the possible correlations with lower
energy bands in realistic GRB afterglow models. In the standard GRB afterglow
model, the relativistic homogeneous shock is usually considered to be fully
adiabatic, however, it could be partially radiative. Based on the external
forward-shock scenario in both stellar wind and constant-density medium. We
present a radiative-adiabatic analytical model of the synchrotron self-Compton
(SSC) and synchrotron processes considering an electron energy distribution
with a power-law index of 1 < p < 2 and 2 $\leq$ p. We show that the SSC
scenario plays a relevant role in the radiative parameter $\epsilon$, leading
to a prolonged evolution during the slow cooling regime. In a particular case,
we derive the Fermi/LAT light curves together with the photons with energies
$\geq$ 100 MeV in a sample of nine bursts from the second Fermi/LAT GRB catalog
that exhibited temporal and spectral indices with $\geq$ 1.5 and $\approx$ 2,
respectively. These events can hardly be described with closure relations of
the standard synchrotron afterglow model, and also exhibit energetic photons
above the synchrotron limit. We have modeled the multi-wavelength observations
of our sample to constrain the microphysical parameters, the circumburst
density, the bulk Lorentz factor and the mechanism responsible for explaining
the energetic GeV photons.

| Blind Deconvolution on Graphs: Exact and Stable Recovery | Chang Ye, Gonzalo Mateos |   We study a blind deconvolution problem on graphs, which arises in the context
of localizing a few sources that diffuse over networks. While the observations
are bilinear functions of the unknown graph filter coefficients and sparse
input signals, a mild requirement on invertibility of the diffusion filter
enables an efficient convex relaxation leading to a linear programming
formulation that can be tackled with off-the-shelf solvers. Under the
Bernoulli-Gaussian model for the inputs, we derive sufficient exact recovery
conditions in the noise-free setting. A stable recovery result is then
established, ensuring the estimation error remains manageable even when the
observations are corrupted by a small amount of noise. Numerical tests with
synthetic and real-world network data illustrate the merits of the proposed
algorithm, its robustness to noise as well as the benefits of leveraging
multiple signals to aid the (blind) localization of sources of diffusion. At a
fundamental level, the results presented here broaden the scope of classical
blind deconvolution of (spatio-)temporal signals to irregular graph domains.

| Generalized compression and compressive search of large datasets | Morgan E. Prior, Thomas Howard III, Emily Light, Najib Ishaq, Noah M. Daniels |   The Big Data explosion has necessitated the development of search algorithms
that scale sub-linearly in time and memory.
  While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently,
few algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain-specific.
  We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to
perform $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search on compressed data while only decompressing
a small, relevant, portion of the data.
  panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low-dimensional
structure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.
  panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between
two points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in
terms of the other.
  This property holds for many widely-used distance functions, e.g. string edit
distances (Levenshtein, Needleman-Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures
(Jaccard, Dice, etc.).
  We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic,
and set data.
  We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the
compressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.
  panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering
sub-linear time performance for $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search.
  We conclude that panCAKES is an efficient, general-purpose algorithm for
exact compressive search on large datasets that obey the manifold hypothesis.
  We provide an open-source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming
language.

| WeHelp: A Shared Autonomy System for Wheelchair Users | Abulikemu Abuduweili, Alice Wu, Tianhao Wei, Weiye Zhao |   There is a large population of wheelchair users. Most of the wheelchair users
need help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs
are not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this
project, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair
users. A robot with a WeHelp system has three modes, following mode, remote
control mode and tele-operation mode. In the following mode, the robot follows
the wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can
ask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the
wheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech
recognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode.
In the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy
stick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs,
such as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high
shelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant
takes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks
for their needs. Our evaluation shows that the pipeline is useful and practical
for wheelchair users. Source code and demo of the paper are available at

| Identifying inflated Fermi surfaces via thermoelectric response in
  $d$-wave superconductor heterostructure | Amartya Pal, Paramita Dutta, Arijit Saha |   We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric response of inflated Fermi
surfaces (IFSs) generated in a two dimensional unconventional $d$-wave
superconductor subjected to an external in-plane Zeeman field. These IFSs
exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are
topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the
Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave
superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients
including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and
examine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage
and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of
$d$-wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the
normal-superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric
response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in
Seebeck coefficient ($\sim 200\,\mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($\sim 3.5$) due to the
generation of the IFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for
device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by
computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice-regularized
version of our continuum model.

| JEAN: Joint Expression and Audio-guided NeRF-based Talking Face
  Generation | Sai Tanmay Reddy Chakkera, Aggelina Chatziagapi, Dimitris Samaras |   We introduce a novel method for joint expression and audio-guided talking
face generation. Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker
identity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these
challenges, we propose a NeRF-based network. Since we train our network on
monocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn
disentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio
features in a self-supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects.
By incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned
audio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle
motion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer-based architecture
that learns expression features, capturing long-range facial expressions and
disentangling them from the speech-specific mouth movements. Through
quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-fidelity talking face videos, achieving state-of-the-art facial
expression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.

| Autopet III challenge: Incorporating anatomical knowledge into nnUNet
  for lesion segmentation in PET/CT | Hamza Kalisch, Fabian Hörst, Ken Herrmann, Jens Kleesiek, Constantin Seibold |   Lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging is essential for precise tumor
characterization, which supports personalized treatment planning and enhances
diagnostic precision in oncology. However, accurate manual segmentation of
lesions is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. Given the
rising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods,
particularly deep-learning-based approaches, have become increasingly more
relevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation
of tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting,
addressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable
solutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET
challenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers
(FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers. To this extent, we developed a
classifier that identifies the tracer of the given PET/CT based on the Maximum
Intensity Projection of the PET scan. We trained two individual
nnUNet-ensembles for each tracer where anatomical labels are included as a
multi-label task to enhance the model's performance. Our final submission
achieves cross-validation Dice scores of 76.90% and 61.33% for the publicly
available FDG and PSMA datasets, respectively. The code is available at

| Robots that Learn to Safely Influence via Prediction-Informed
  Reach-Avoid Dynamic Games | Ravi Pandya, Changliu Liu, Andrea Bajcsy |   Robots can influence people to accomplish their tasks more efficiently:
autonomous cars can inch forward at an intersection to pass through, and
tabletop manipulators can go for an object on the table first. However, a
robot's ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if
naively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach-avoid
dynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a
safety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human's behavior
as goal-driven but conditioned on the robot's plan, enabling us to capture
influence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical
and belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in
human behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE
(Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high-dimensional
(39-D) simulated human-robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline
game-theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust
baseline that treats the human as a worst-case adversary, a safety controller
that does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy-function-based
safety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage
the influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing
the robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate
during task execution.

| Decoding Style: Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Image-Guided Outfit
  Recommendation with Preference | Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan |   Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding
both fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper
presents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large
language models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their \"black box\" and static
nature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item
visual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style
and color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis
for personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the
open-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability
to recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative
examples is employed to enhance the LLM's decision-making process. This creates
a self-enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in
line with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore
dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill-in-the-blank,
and complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework's
ability to generate stylish, trend-aligned outfit suggestions, continuously
improving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our
proposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more
cohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the
proposed framework's potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate
suggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit
generation.

| Mechanical Wannier-Stark Ladder of Diamond Spin-Mechanical Lamb Wave
  Resonators | Philip Andrango, Hailin Wang |   We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier-Stark ladders of
diamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with
ultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin
properties. Three nearest-neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric
configurations and a large range of coupling rates have been explored for the
realization of Wannier-Stark ladders of LWRs, potentially enabling long-range
connectivity between spin qubits through their interactions with mechanical
vibrations. Additional analysis on the effects of disorder indicates that the
proposed Wannier-Stark ladder can be robust against realistic experimental
imperfections. The development of mechanical quantum networks of spin qubits
with long-range connectivity can open the door to the implementation of newly
developed quantum low-density parity-check codes in solid-state systems.

| MAgICoRe: Multi-Agent, Iterative, Coarse-to-Fine Refinement for
  Reasoning | Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Archiki Prasad, Swarnadeep Saha, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal |   Large Language Models' (LLM) reasoning can be improved using test-time
aggregation strategies, i.e., generating multiple samples and voting among
generated samples. While these improve performance, they often reach a
saturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated
feedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key
challenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can
over-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and
address errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to
identify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding
how many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too
soon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose
MAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty
as easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard
ones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error
localization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores.
Moreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with
three agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on
step-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure
sufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating
further rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5
and show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of
MAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by
4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with
baselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our
ablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe's RMs and multi-agent
communication.

| Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka |   Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string
processing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into
blocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence
of a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another
occurrence earlier in $T$. Due to numerous applications, LZ77 factorization is
one of the most studied problems on strings. In the 47 years since its
inception, several algorithms were developed for different models of
computation, including parallel, GPU, external-memory, and quantum. Remarkably,
however, the complexity of the most basic variant is still not settled: All
existing algorithms in the RAM model run in $\Omega(n)$ time, which is a
$\Theta(\log n)$ factor away from the lower bound of $\Omega(n/\log n)$
(following from the necessity to read the input, which takes $\Theta(n/\log n)$
space for $T\in\{0,1\}^{n}$).
  We present the first $o(n)$-time algorithm for LZ77 factorization, breaking
the linear-time barrier present for nearly 50 years. For $T\in\{0,1\}^{n}$, our
algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(n/\sqrt{\log n})=o(n)$ time and uses the optimal
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log n)$ working space. Our algorithm generalizes to
$\Sigma=[0..\sigma)$, where $\sigma=n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The runtime and
working space then become $\mathcal{O}((n\log\sigma)/\sqrt{\log n})$ and
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma} n)$. To obtain our algorithm, we prove a more
general result: For any constant $\epsilon\in(0,1)$ and $T\in[0..\sigma)^{n}$,
in $\mathcal{O}((n\log\sigma)/\sqrt{\log n})$ time and using
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma}n)$ space, we can construct an
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma}n)$-size index that, given any $P=T[j..j+\ell)$
(represented as $(j,\ell)$), computes the leftmost occurrence of $P$ in $T$ in
$\mathcal{O}(\log^{\epsilon}n)$ time. In other words, we solve the
indexing/online variant of the LZ77 problem.

are unnoticeable to consumers. Using a behavioral experiment, we show that
conversational AI models can indeed significantly shift consumer preferences.

precise mass measurements of neutron-rich Ru and Pd isotopes performed at the

$^{108}$Ru, $^{110}$Ru and $^{116}$Pd were measured to a relative mass
precision $\delta m/m \approx 10^{-8}$ via the phase-imaging
ion-cyclotron-resonance technique, and represent an improvement of
approximately an order of magnitude over previous measurements. These mass data
were used in conjunction with the physically interpretable machine learning

excesses via a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The effects of our new mass

generating high-quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human

to their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec
language model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a
multi-task training framework, capable of generating high-fidelity natural
speech in a zero-shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and
timbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while
advocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its
naturalness and expressiveness. Last, we propose the Takin Morphing system with
highly decoupled and advanced timbre and prosody modeling approaches, which
enables individuals to customize speech production with their preferred timbre
and prosody in a precise and controllable manner. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness and robustness of our Takin AudioLLM series models.

to sparse computation through expert routing, selectively activating only a
small subset of expert modules. However, sparse computation challenges
traditional training practices, as discrete expert routing hinders standard
backpropagation and thus gradient-based optimization, which are the cornerstone
of deep learning. To better pursue the scaling power of MoE, we introduce GRIN
(GRadient-INformed MoE training), which incorporates sparse gradient estimation
for expert routing and configures model parallelism to avoid token dropping.
Applying GRIN to autoregressive language modeling, we develop a top-2
16$\times$3.8B MoE model. Our model, with only 6.6B activated parameters,
outperforms a 7B dense model and matches the performance of a 14B dense model
trained on the same data. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks
demonstrate the potential of GRIN to significantly enhance MoE efficacy,
achieving 79.4 on MMLU, 83.7 on HellaSwag, 74.4 on HumanEval, and 58.9 on MATH.

| BERT-VBD: Vietnamese Multi-Document Summarization Framework | Tuan-Cuong Vuong, Trang Mai Xuan, Thien Van Luong |   In tackling the challenge of Multi-Document Summarization (MDS), numerous
methods have been proposed, spanning both extractive and abstractive
summarization techniques. However, each approach has its own limitations,
making it less effective to rely solely on either one. An emerging and
promising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractive
summarization methods. Despite the plethora of studies in this domain, research
on the combined methodology remains scarce, particularly in the context of
Vietnamese language processing. This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDS
framework leveraging a two-component pipeline architecture that integrates
extractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs an
extractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This is
achieved by a modification of the pre-trained BERT network, which derives
semantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet network
structures. The second component utilizes the VBD-LLaMA2-7B-50b model for
abstractive summarization, ultimately generating the final summary document.
Our proposed framework demonstrates a positive performance, attaining ROUGE-2

| Einstein-dilaton-four-Maxwell Holographic Anisotropic Models | Irina Ya. Aref'eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov |   In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the
five-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell models has played a crucial role.
Typically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while
additional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A
more general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field
represents spatial longitudinal-transverse anisotropy, while the third and
fourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We
consider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero
temperature and five functions at non-zero temperature. Maxwell field related
to the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,
whereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.
We demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of
the seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations -- either the
dilaton or the vector potential equation -- follows from the Einstein equations
and the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi
identity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress-energy
tensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is
provided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to
three Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis
shows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein
equations and the equation for the vector potential

| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components
  for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco-Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram |   Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data
together with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal
components used. It is therefore important to determine the number of
significant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a
variational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for
estimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of
samples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This
eliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of
principal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.
This framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows
and columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),
and with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data
with arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as
cultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our
method on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may
underestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the
synthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical
dataset. These results suggest that it is broadly applicable across the life
sciences.

| Linguini: A benchmark for language-agnostic linguistic reasoning | Eduardo Sánchez, Belen Alastruey, Christophe Ropers, Pontus Stenetorp, Mikel Artetxe, Marta R. Costa-jussà |   We propose a new benchmark to measure a language model's linguistic reasoning
skills without relying on pre-existing language-specific knowledge. The test
covers 894 questions grouped in 160 problems across 75 (mostly) extremely
low-resource languages, extracted from the International Linguistic Olympiad
corpus. To attain high accuracy on this benchmark, models don't need previous
knowledge of the tested language, as all the information needed to solve the
linguistic puzzle is presented in the context. We find that, while all analyzed
models rank below 25% accuracy, there is a significant gap between open and
closed models, with the best-performing proprietary model at 24.05% and the
best-performing open model at 8.84%.

| From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the
  primordial black hole reheating scenario | Guillem Domènech, Jan Tränkle |   We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs
originate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight
PBHs with masses $M\lesssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat
it via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate
whether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH
reheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the
initial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer
functions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and
isocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation
of state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH
dominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the
spectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive
to $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density
fluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance
as a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
observations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the
initial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we
find that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several
future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas,
especially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any
early matter-dominated universe scenario.

| Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules | Anqi Zhang, Wilson S. Geisler |   Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We
investigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented
displays having well-separated potential target-object locations. Performance
was compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption
that the information from the different potential target locations is
statistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than
optimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the
implausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show
that three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical
results. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near
optimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the
central potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise
causes search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These
findings have far-reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks
and other identification tasks in humans and other animals.

| Far-from-equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann
  approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows
  $v_n$ | Vincenzo Nugara, Vincenzo Greco, Salvatore Plumari |   We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal
system in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution
function and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system
sizes $R$ and interaction strength $\eta/s$ and identify universality classes
based upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each
of this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $\hat
\gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results
highlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum
moments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to
a 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of
different sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a
similar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse
flow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system
size and $\eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and
their response functions, along with the impact of the $\eta/s$ and the system
transverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in
momentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow
$v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of
large opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems
evolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play
in this process.

| Qwen2.5-Math Technical Report: Toward Mathematical Expert Model via
  Self-Improvement | An Yang, Beichen Zhang, Binyuan Hui, Bofei Gao, Bowen Yu, Chengpeng Li, Dayiheng Liu, Jianhong Tu, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin, Keming Lu, Mingfeng Xue, Runji Lin, Tianyu Liu, Xingzhang Ren, Zhenru Zhang |   In this report, we present a series of math-specific large language models:
Qwen2.5-Math and Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct-1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the
Qwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self-improvement
throughout the entire pipeline, from pre-training and post-training to
inference: (1) During the pre-training phase, Qwen2-Math-Instruct is utilized
to generate large-scale, high-quality mathematical data. (2) In the
post-training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive
sampling from Qwen2-Math-Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative
evolution of data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model,
it's possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the
next round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the
ultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct.
(3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling,
optimizing the model's performance.
  Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced
mathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics
datasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and
AIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math
competition problems.

| Computing the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two-Dimensional
  Strongly-Correlated Systems | Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn |   We show that the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time-reversal
invariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary-condition
dependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non-interacting and
strongly-correlated insulators. By introducing a family of quasi-single
particle states associated to the many-body ground state of an insulator, we
show that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant can be expressed as the integral of a
certain Berry connection over half the space of boundary conditions, providing
an alternative expression to the formulations that appear in [Lee et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. $\textbf{100}$, 186807 (2008)]. We show the equivalence of the
different many-body formulations of the invariant, and show how they reduce to
known band-theoretic results for Slater determinant ground states. Finally, we
apply our results to analytically calculate the invariant for the Kane-Mele
model with nonlocal (orbital) Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) interactions. This
rigorously establishes the topological nontriviality of the Kane-Mele model
with HK interactions, and represents one of the few exact calculations of the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a strongly-interacting system.

| Weak Lensing analysis of Abell 2390 using short exposures | A. Dutta, J. R. Peterson, T. Rose, M. Cianfaglione, A. Bonafede, G. Li, G. Sembroski |   We present a weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 2390 at z =
0.23 using second moment shape measurements made in 411 short 60s exposures.
The exposures are obtained in three broadband photometric filters (g, r, i)
using WIYN-ODI. Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a
moment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching
algorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The
measurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight
to obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim
simulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find
the mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We
also find the E-Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic
structures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical
and X-Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to
map large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of
the cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the
peaks are similar to X-Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster
and show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.

| Low Frame-rate Speech Codec: a Codec Designed for Fast High-quality
  Speech LLM Training and Inference | Edresson Casanova, Ryan Langman, Paarth Neekhara, Shehzeen Hussain, Jason Li, Subhankar Ghosh, Ante Jukić, Sang-gil Lee |   Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing
through audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the
application of language modeling techniques to audio data. However, audio
codecs often operate at high frame rates, resulting in slow training and
inference, especially for autoregressive models. To address this challenge, we
present the Low Frame-rate Speech Codec (LFSC): a neural audio codec that
leverages finite scalar quantization and adversarial training with large speech
language models to achieve high-quality audio compression with a 1.89 kbps
bitrate and 21.5 frames per second. We demonstrate that our novel codec can
make the inference of LLM-based text-to-speech models around three times faster
while improving intelligibility and producing quality comparable to previous
models.

| Stronger Baseline Models -- A Key Requirement for Aligning Machine
  Learning Research with Clinical Utility | Nathan Wolfrath, Joel Wolfrath, Hengrui Hu, Anjishnu Banerjee, Anai N. Kothari |   Machine Learning (ML) research has increased substantially in recent years,
due to the success of predictive modeling across diverse application domains.
However, well-known barriers exist when attempting to deploy ML models in
high-stakes, clinical settings, including lack of model transparency (or the
inability to audit the inference process), large training data requirements
with siloed data sources, and complicated metrics for measuring model utility.
In this work, we show empirically that including stronger baseline models in
healthcare ML evaluations has important downstream effects that aid
practitioners in addressing these challenges. Through a series of case studies,
we find that the common practice of omitting baselines or comparing against a
weak baseline model (e.g. a linear model with no optimization) obscures the
value of ML methods proposed in the research literature. Using these insights,
we propose some best practices that will enable practitioners to more
effectively study and deploy ML models in clinical settings.

| Revisiting Dark Photon Constraints from CMB Spectral Distortions | Jens Chluba, Bryce Cyr, Matthew C. Johnson |   Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide
stringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post-BBN (Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models
with COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.
Here, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark
photon conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous
works only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the
change to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon
distortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the
distortion has an opposite sign and a $\simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We
furthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover
the redshift range $\simeq 2\times 10^6-4\times 10^7$ between the $\mu$-era and
the end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints
for dark photon masses in the range $10^{-4}\,{\rm eV}\lesssim m_{\rm
dp}\lesssim 10^{-3}\,{\rm eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We
demonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon
to dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $\mu$-type distortion
independent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study
dark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with
CMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.

| Bi-objective trail-planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous
  environment | Cory M. Simon, Jeffrey Richley, Lucas Overbey, Darleen Perez-Lavin |   Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in
resource delivery, patrolling, information-gathering, agriculture, forest fire
fighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and
search-and-rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments -- with e.g.
rough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or
capturing robots -- should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of
risks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should
take the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the
team-level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward
from visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider
bi-objective trail-planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a
hazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed
graph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of
survival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a
robot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for
the Pareto-optimal robot-team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team
objectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive
the mission. A human decision-maker can then select trail plans that balance,
according to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony
optimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto-optimal set of
robot team trail plans. As a case study, we illustrate with an
information-gathering mission in an art museum.

| Pareto Data Framework: Steps Towards Resource-Efficient Decision Making
  Using Minimum Viable Data (MVD) | Tashfain Ahmed, Josh Siegel |   This paper introduces the Pareto Data Framework, an approach for identifying
and selecting the Minimum Viable Data (MVD) required for enabling machine
learning applications on constrained platforms such as embedded systems, mobile
devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We demonstrate that strategic
data reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing
bandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies
Minimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource-constrained
environments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient
practices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and
overprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for
optimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data
representation. An experimental methodology demonstrates effective acoustic
data characterization after downsampling, quantization, and truncation to
simulate reduced-fidelity sensors and network and storage constraints; results
shows that performance can be maintained up to 95\% with sample rates reduced
by 75\% and bit depths and clip length reduced by 50\% which translates into
substantial cost and resource reduction. These findings have implications on
the design and development of constrained systems. The paper also discusses
broader implications of the framework, including the potential to democratize
advanced AI technologies across IoT applications and sectors such as
agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing to improve access and multiply
the benefits of data-driven insights.

| Applications of Knowledge Distillation in Remote Sensing: A Survey | Yassine Himeur, Nour Aburaed, Omar Elharrouss, Iraklis Varlamis, Shadi Atalla, Wathiq Mansoor, Hussain Al Ahmad |   With the ever-growing complexity of models in the field of remote sensing
(RS), there is an increasing demand for solutions that balance model accuracy
with computational efficiency. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a
powerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,
complex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in
performance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and
its innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer
knowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact
and efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application
across various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and
historical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are
highlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational
efficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical
deployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of
KD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the
breadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case
studies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,
such as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review
discusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical
constraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive
overview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS. Through this
organization, the paper not only elucidates the current state of research in KD
but also sets the stage for future research opportunities, thereby contributing
significantly to both academic research and real-world applications.

function properly. Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing
evidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,
these growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,
more and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth-dependent systems
and develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of
'growth dependence' still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,
which impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article
proposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the
concept of 'growth dependence' across socio-economic systems. We provide a
general definition consisting of four components that can be specified for
different empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of
measurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions
or properties of the system under investigation. According to our general
definition, a socio-economic system is growth-dependent if it requires a
long-term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to
maintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen
normative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to
three areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:
employment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies
demonstrate that whether or not a system is growth-dependent hinges not only on
the empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of
the concept of growth dependence. Our framework enables coherent, robust and
effective definitions and research questions, fostering comparability of
findings across different cases and disciplines.

| SPRMamba: Surgical Phase Recognition for Endoscopic Submucosal
  Dissection with Mamba | Xiangning Zhang, Jinnan Chen, Qingwei Zhang, Chengfeng Zhou, Zhengjie Zhang, Xiaobo Li, Dahong Qian |   Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive procedure
initially designed for the treatment of early gastric cancer but is now widely
used for various gastrointestinal lesions. Computer-assisted Surgery systems
have played a crucial role in improving the precision and safety of ESD
procedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognition
of surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesion
characteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real-time
surgical phase recognition algorithms. Existing surgical phase recognition
algorithms struggle to efficiently capture temporal contexts in video-based
scenarios, leading to insufficient performance. To address these issues, we
propose SPRMamba, a novel Mamba-based framework for ESD surgical phase
recognition. SPRMamba leverages the strengths of Mamba for long-term temporal
modeling while introducing the Scaled Residual TranMamba block to enhance the
capture of fine-grained details, overcoming the limitations of traditional
temporal models like Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformers.
Moreover, a Temporal Sample Strategy is introduced to accelerate the
processing, which is essential for real-time phase recognition in clinical
settings. Extensive testing on the ESD385 dataset and the cholecystectomy
Cholec80 dataset demonstrates that SPRMamba surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits greater robustness across various surgical phase
recognition tasks.

| Measuring Human and AI Values based on Generative Psychometrics with
  Large Language Models | Haoran Ye, Yuhang Xie, Yuanyi Ren, Hanjun Fang, Xin Zhang, Guojie Song |   Human values and their measurement are long-standing interdisciplinary
inquiry. Recent advances in AI have sparked renewed interest in this area, with
large language models (LLMs) emerging as both tools and subjects of value
measurement. This work introduces Generative Psychometrics for Values (GPV), an
LLM-based, data-driven value measurement paradigm, theoretically grounded in
text-revealed selective perceptions. We begin by fine-tuning an LLM for
accurate perception-level value measurement and verifying the capability of
LLMs to parse texts into perceptions, forming the core of the GPV pipeline.
Applying GPV to human-authored blogs, we demonstrate its stability, validity,
and superiority over prior psychological tools. Then, extending GPV to LLM
value measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometric
methodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free-form
outputs, enabling context-specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis of
measurement paradigms, indicating response biases of prior methods; and 3) an
attempt to bridge LLM values and their safety, revealing the predictive power
of different value systems and the impacts of various values on LLM safety.
Through interdisciplinary efforts, we aim to leverage AI for next-generation
psychometrics and psychometrics for value-aligned AI.

| FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated
  Long-Tailed Learning | Xiuhua Lu, Peng Li, Xuefeng Jiang |   Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy
in distributed machine learning. However, datasets distributed across each
client in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can
be globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly
affects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated
learning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it
fails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data.
This results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting
the equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a
methodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,
we propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the
local training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred
optimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state-of-the-art
methods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed
distribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10-LT and
CIFAR-100-LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of
model performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long-tailed
distribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.

| Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error
  Detection | Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia |   Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications. Doing
so requires overcoming the noise present on today's hardware. The quantum
approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling
up due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup
over state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems. However,
achieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require
fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant
implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection
code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the
algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with
up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we
propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance, and use it
to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance
to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our
model can be used to determine necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform
Goemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware. Our results demonstrate the
largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially
fault-tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date,
paving the way towards solving real-world applications with quantum computers.

| Cyclicity Analysis of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process | Vivek Kaushik |   In this thesis, we consider an $N$-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)
process satisfying the linear stochastic differential equation $d\mathbf x(t) =
- \mathbf B\mathbf x(t) dt + \boldsymbol \Sigma d \mathbf w(t).$ Here, $\mathbf
B$ is a fixed $N \times N$ circulant friction matrix whose eigenvalues have
positive real parts, $\boldsymbol \Sigma$ is a fixed $N \times M$ matrix. We
consider a signal propagation model governed by this OU process. In this model,
an underlying signal propagates throughout a network consisting of $N$ linked
sensors located in space. We interpret the $n$-th component of the OU process
as the measurement of the propagating effect made by the $n$-th sensor. The
matrix $\mathbf B$ represents the sensor network structure: if $\mathbf B$ has
first row $(b_1 \ , \ \dots \ , \ b_N),$ where $b_1>0$ and $b_2 \ , \ \dots \
,\ b_N \le 0,$ then the magnitude of $b_p$ quantifies how receptive the $n$-th
sensor is to activity within the $(n+p-1)$-th sensor. Finally, the $(m,n)$-th
entry of the matrix $\mathbf D = \frac{\boldsymbol \Sigma \boldsymbol
\Sigma^\text T}{2}$ is the covariance of the component noises injected into the
$m$-th and $n$-th sensors. For different choices of $\mathbf B$ and
$\boldsymbol \Sigma,$ we investigate whether Cyclicity Analysis enables us to
recover the structure of network. Roughly speaking, Cyclicity Analysis studies
the lead-lag dynamics pertaining to the components of a multivariate signal. We
specifically consider an $N \times N$ skew-symmetric matrix $\mathbf Q,$ known
as the lead matrix, in which the sign of its $(m,n)$-th entry captures the
lead-lag relationship between the $m$-th and $n$-th component OU processes. We
investigate whether the structure of the leading eigenvector of $\mathbf Q,$
the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of $\mathbf Q$ in
modulus, reflects the network structure induced by $\mathbf B.$

| Brain-Streams: fMRI-to-Image Reconstruction with Multi-modal Guidance | Jaehoon Joo, Taejin Jeong, Seongjae Hwang |   Understanding how humans process visual information is one of the crucial
steps for unraveling the underlying mechanism of brain activity. Recently, this
curiosity has motivated the fMRI-to-image reconstruction task; given the fMRI
data from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual
stimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent
Diffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex
visual stimuli such as high-resolution natural images from vision datasets.
Despite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often
lack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.
Consequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere
visuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs
effectively incorporate multi-modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,
and image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image
generations. Specifically, inspired by the two-streams hypothesis suggesting
that perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain
regions, our framework, Brain-Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain
regions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from
semantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information
regions, Brain-Streams provides accurate multi-modal guidance to LDMs. We
validate the reconstruction ability of Brain-Streams both quantitatively and
qualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI
data.

| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal
  execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huyên Pham |   Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and
constraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity
markets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general
propagator model under linear functional inequality constraints. The optimal
control is given explicitly in terms of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers
and their conditional expectations, as a solution to a linear stochastic
Fredholm equation. We propose a stochastic version of the Uzawa algorithm on
the dual problem to construct the stochastic Lagrange multipliers numerically
via a stochastic projected gradient ascent, combined with a least-squares Monte
Carlo regression step to approximate their conditional expectations. We
illustrate our findings on two different practical applications with stochastic
signals: (i) an optimal execution problem with an exponential or a power law
decaying transient impact, with either a `no-shorting' constraint in the
presence of a `sell' signal, a `no-buying' constraint in the presence of a
`buy' signal or a stochastic `stop-trading' constraint whenever the exogenous
price drops below a specified reference level; (ii) a battery storage problem
with instantaneous operating costs, seasonal signals and fixed constraints on
both the charging power and the load capacity of the battery.

| Skill matching at scale: freelancer-project alignment for efficient
  multilingual candidate retrieval | Warren Jouanneau, Marc Palyart, Emma Jouffroy |   Finding the perfect match between a job proposal and a set of freelancers is
not an easy task to perform at scale, especially in multiple languages. In this
paper, we propose a novel neural retriever architecture that tackles this
problem in a multilingual setting. Our method encodes project descriptions and
freelancer profiles by leveraging pre-trained multilingual language models. The
latter are used as backbone for a custom transformer architecture that aims to
keep the structure of the profiles and project. This model is trained with a
contrastive loss on historical data. Thanks to several experiments, we show
that this approach effectively captures skill matching similarity and
facilitates efficient matching, outperforming traditional methods.

| An Efficient Projection-Based Next-best-view Planning Framework for
  Reconstruction of Unknown Objects | Zhizhou Jia, Shaohui Zhang, Qun Hao |   Efficiently and completely capturing the three-dimensional data of an object
is a fundamental problem in industrial and robotic applications. The task of
next-best-view (NBV) planning is to infer the pose of the next viewpoint based
on the current data, and gradually realize the complete three-dimensional
reconstruction. Many existing algorithms, however, suffer a large computational
burden due to the use of ray-casting. To address this, this paper proposes a
projection-based NBV planning framework. It can select the next best view at an
extremely fast speed while ensuring the complete scanning of the object.
Specifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into
ellipsoids based on the voxel structure.Then, the next best view is selected
from the candidate views using a projection-based viewpoint quality evaluation
function in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy. This process
replaces the ray-casting in voxel structures, significantly improving the
computational efficiency. Comparative experiments with other algorithms in a
simulation environment show that the framework proposed in this paper can
achieve 10 times efficiency improvement on the basis of capturing roughly the
same coverage. The real-world experimental results also prove the efficiency
and feasibility of the framework.

| Undersampling effects on observed periods of coronal oscillations | Daye Lim, Tom Van Doorsselaere, Valery M. Nakariakov, Dmitrii Y. Kolotkov, Yuhang Gao, David Berghmans |   Context. Recent observations of decayless transverse oscillations have shown
two branches in the relationship between periods and loop lengths. One is a
linear relationship, interpreted as a standing mode. The other shows almost no
correlation and has not yet been interpreted conclusively. Aims. We
investigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless
oscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely
follow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations
are standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations
where the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase
are randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal
by considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of
telescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast
Fourier transform. Results. When the sampling cadence is getting closer to the
actual oscillation period, a tendency for overestimating periods in short loops
is enhanced. The relationship between loop lengths and periods of the sampled
signals shows the two branches as in the observation. Conclusions. We find that
long periods of decayless oscillations occurring in short loops could be the
result of undersampling.

| Enwrapped Perylene Bisimide Enables Room Temperature Polariton Lasing
  and Photonic Lattices | Dominik Horneber, Johannes Düreth, Tim Schembri, Simon Betzold, Matthias Stolte, Sven Höfling, Frank Würthner, Sebastian Klembt |   Perylene bisimides (PBIs) are organic dyes with photoluminescence quantum
yields (PLQY) close to unity in solution and great thermal and photo-chemical
stability. These features alongside the tunability of their solid-state packing
arrangement via chemical functionalization make this material class an
excellent candidate for exciton-polariton lasing at room temperature. Polariton
lasing is well understood in III-V semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures,
however, the search for emitter materials for robust and versatile room
temperature applications is ongoing. While e.g. perovskites and several organic
materials have been identified to support polariton lasing, many of these
materials lack tunability and long-term stability under ambient conditions.
Here, we fabricate optical microcavities using a strongly enwrapped PBI
chromophore with prevailing monomer-like absorption and emission properties in
the solid state. Voluminous bay-substituents prevent stacking induced
PLQY-quenching, thereby enabling polariton lasing at room temperature.
Additionally, photonic confinement in single hemispheric resonators is
demonstrated leading to localized polaritonic modes with discrete energies, as
well as optical lattices revealing distinct polaritonic band-structures. Due to
the possibility of tunable properties by the precise control of the solid-state
packing arrangement of PBI emitters, our results pave the way for
polarization-dependent light-matter coupling, including topological photonic
effects within oriented crystalline thin-film microcavity structures.

| IMRL: Integrating Visual, Physical, Temporal, and Geometric
  Representations for Enhanced Food Acquisition | Rui Liu, Zahiruddin Mahammad, Amisha Bhaskar, Pratap Tokekar |   Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality
of life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse
food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents
unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric
information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g.,
color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially
when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance.
We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition.
Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy
based on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, such
representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse
acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which
integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance
the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach
captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular,
liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and
introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and
assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies
based on context, improving the robot's capability to handle diverse food
acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach's
robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations,
including zero-shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves
improvement up to $35\%$ in success rate compared with the best-performing
baseline.

| Uncovering liquid-substrate fluctuation effects on crystal growth and
  disordered hyperuniformity of two-dimensional materials | S. K. Mkhonta, Zhi-Feng Huang, K. R. Elder |   We investigate the growth of two-dimensional (2D) crystals on fluctuating
surfaces using a phase field crystal model that is relevant on atomic length
and diffusive time scales. Motivated by recent experiments which achieved
unprecedented fast growth of large-size high-quality 2D crystals on liquid
substrates, we uncover novel effects of liquid surfaces on microstructural
ordering. We find that substrate fluctuations generate short-ranged noise that
speeds up crystallization and grain growth of the overlayer, surpassing that of
free-standing system. Coupling to the liquid substrate fluctuations can also
modulate local randomness, leading to intriguing disordered structures with
hidden spatial order, i.e., disordered hyperuniformity. These results reveal
the physical mechanisms underlying the fast growth of 2D crystals on liquid
surfaces and demonstrate a novel strategy for synthesizing disordered
hyperuniform thin film structures.

| The Impact of Element Ordering on LM Agent Performance | Wayne Chi, Ameet Talwalkar, Chris Donahue |   There has been a surge of interest in language model agents that can navigate
virtual environments such as the web or desktop. To navigate such environments,
agents benefit from information on the various elements (e.g., buttons, text,
or images) present. It remains unclear which element attributes have the
greatest impact on agent performance, especially in environments that only
provide a graphical representation (i.e., pixels). Here we find that the
ordering in which elements are presented to the language model is surprisingly
impactful--randomizing element ordering in a webpage degrades agent performance
comparably to removing all visible text from an agent's state representation.
While a webpage provides a hierarchical ordering of elements, there is no such
ordering when parsing elements directly from pixels. Moreover, as tasks become
more challenging and models more sophisticated, our experiments suggest that
the impact of ordering increases. Finding an effective ordering is non-trivial.
We investigate the impact of various element ordering methods in web and
desktop environments. We find that dimensionality reduction provides a viable
ordering for pixel-only environments. We train a UI element detection model to
derive elements from pixels and apply our findings to an agent
benchmark--OmniACT--where we only have access to pixels. Our method completes
more than two times as many tasks on average relative to the previous
state-of-the-art.

| Quark saturation in the QCD phase diagram | Marcus Bluhm, Yuki Fujimoto, Larry McLerran, Marlene Nahrgang |   We determine the onset of Quarkyonic Matter corresponding to values of
temperature and baryon chemical potential at which the quark phase space
density becomes one. At zero temperature for baryon chemical potentials below
the mass of the Lambda baryon, only nucleons contribute to the quark density.
This is different at finite temperature, where all baryons, mesons and their
resonances can be excited and thus add quarks to the phase space. The
probability density to find a quark inside a hadron is determined using the
Yukawa ansatz of the IdylliQ model of Quarkyonic Matter. We estimate separately
the magnitude of the various contributions of nucleons, Delta baryons, pions as
well as further hadrons and resonances. The uncertainty in the parametrization
of the probability density to find a quark inside a nucleon is spanned by
assuming that at zero temperature the transition density to Quarkyonic Matter
is between one and three times that of nuclear matter. Various predictions for
a possible critical point associated with the chiral phase transition are found
close to a triple point at which the line of the deconfinement transition and
the curve associated with the transition to Quarkyonic Matter intersect. These
considerations provide an estimate for the region in the QCD phase diagram
where Quarkyonic Matter may be found.

predict the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to End-Stage Renal

health insurance organization to develop prediction models for multiple

particularly with a 24-month observation window, exhibits superior performance
in predicting ESRD progression, outperforming existing models in the
literature. We further apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to
enhance interpretability, providing insights into the impact of individual
features on predictions at the individual patient level. This study underscores
the value of leveraging administrative claims data for CKD management and
predicting ESRD progression.

machine learning-based approaches for the classification of top-jets from QCD
jets. The review focuses on the present status of boosted top tagging and its

We employ a set of CLS $N_f=2$ ensembles at three lattice spacings and various
quark masses to extrapolate the pseudo distribution to the physical point in
the isospin limit. We solve the inverse problem modeling the distribution
amplitude, and we match our results to the light-cone in the
$\overline{\text{MS}}$-scheme. We include a complete error budget, and we
compare to two alternative approaches: non-relativistic QCD and Dyson-Schwinger
equations, finding good agreement with the latter but not with the former.

no-flux boundary conditions in a smoothly bounded convex domain $\Omega\subset
\R^2$, where the nonnegative function $f\in C^1([0,\infty))$ is asked to
satisfy $f(s)\le C_fs^{\al}$ with $\al, C_f>0$ for all $s\ge 1$.
  The global existence of weak solutions or classical solutions to the above
system has been established in both one- and two-dimensional bounded convex
domains in previous works. However, the results concerning the large time
behavior are still constrained to one dimension due to the lack of a
Harnack-type inequality in the two-dimensional case. In this note, we
complement this result by using the Moser iteration technique and building a
new Harnack-type inequality.

| ReLU Surrogates in Mixed-Integer MPC for Irrigation Scheduling | Bernard T. Agyeman, Jinfeng Liu, Sirish L. Shah |   Efficient water management in agriculture is important for mitigating the
growing freshwater scarcity crisis. Mixed-integer Model Predictive Control
(MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex
scheduling problems in agricultural irrigation. However, the computational
complexity of mixed-integer MPC still poses a significant challenge,
particularly in large-scale applications. This study proposes an approach to
enhance the computational efficiency of mixed-integer MPC-based irrigation
schedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture
dynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed-integer linear
representation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the
mixed-integer MPC-based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a
mixed-integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed-integer
nonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global
optimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated
through comparative studies conducted on a large-scale agricultural field
across two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models,
specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used
triggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU-based approach significantly
reduces solution times -- by up to 99.5\% -- while achieving comparable
performance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water
Use Efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, the ReLU-based approach maintains enhanced
performance in terms of total prescribed irrigation and IWUE compared to the
widely-used triggered irrigation scheduling method.

| Design of Ligand-Binding Proteins with Atomic Flow Matching | Junqi Liu, Shaoning Li, Chence Shi, Zhi Yang, Jian Tang |   Designing novel proteins that bind to small molecules is a long-standing
challenge in computational biology, with applications in developing catalysts,
biosensors, and more. Current computational methods rely on the assumption that
the binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible,
as conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon
binding. In this work, we formulate proteins and molecules as unified
biotokens, and present AtomFlow, a novel deep generative model under the
flow-matching framework for the design of ligand-binding proteins from the 2D
target molecular graph alone. Operating on representative atoms of biotokens,
AtomFlow captures the flexibility of ligands and generates ligand conformations
and protein backbone structures iteratively. We consider the multi-scale nature
of biotokens and demonstrate that AtomFlow can be effectively trained on a
subset of structures from the Protein Data Bank, by matching flow vector field
using an SE(3) equivariant structure prediction network. Experimental results
show that our method can generate high fidelity ligand-binding proteins and
achieve performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model RFDiffusionAA,
while not requiring bound ligand structures. As a general framework, AtomFlow
holds the potential to be applied to various biomolecule generation tasks in
the future.

| Denoising diffusion models for high-resolution microscopy image
  restoration | Pamela Osuna-Vargas, Maren H. Wehrheim, Lucas Zinz, Johanna Rahm, Ashwin Balakrishnan, Alexandra Kaminer, Mike Heilemann, Matthias Kaschube |   Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at
the nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological
organization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of
fluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses
remain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced
laser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and
increased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high-resolution
images by conditioning the model on low-resolution information. Additionally,
the probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images
that tend to further increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We show that our model
achieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously
best-performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly,
while any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but
not all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all
four data sets, suggesting high generalizability.

| Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Via Data Pruning | Andrea Napoli, Paul White |   The removal of carefully-selected examples from training data has recently
emerged as an effective way of improving the robustness of machine learning
models. However, the best way to select these examples remains an open
question. In this paper, we consider the problem from the perspective of
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). We propose AdaPrune, a method for UDA
whereby training examples are removed to attempt to align the training
distribution to that of the target data. By adopting the maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) as the criterion for alignment, the problem can be neatly
formulated and solved as an integer quadratic program. We evaluate our approach
on a real-world domain shift task of bioacoustic event detection. As a method
for UDA, we show that AdaPrune outperforms related techniques, and is
complementary to other UDA algorithms such as CORAL. Our analysis of the
relationship between the MMD and model accuracy, along with t-SNE plots,
validate the proposed method as a principled and well-founded way of performing
data pruning.

| The elastica sling | Alessandro Cazzolli, Francesco Dal Corso |   The nonlinear mechanics of a flexible elastic rod constrained at its edges by
a pair of sliding sleeves is analyzed. The planar equilibrium configurations of
this variable-length elastica are found to have shape defined only by the
inclination of the two constraints, while their distance is responsible only
for scaling the size. By extending the theoretical stability criterion
available for systems under isoperimetric constraints to the case of variable
domains, the existence of no more than one stable equilibrium solution is
revealed. The set of sliding sleeves' inclination pairs for which the stability
is lost are identified. Such critical conditions allow the indefinite ejection
of the flexible rod from the sliding sleeves, thus realizing an elastica sling.
Finally, the theoretical findings are validated by experiments on a physical
prototype. The present results lead to a novel actuation principle that may
find application as a mechanism in energy harvesting, wave mitigation devices,
and soft robotic locomotion.

| Online Refractive Camera Model Calibration in Visual Inertial Odometry | Mohit Singh, Kostas Alexis |   This paper presents a general refractive camera model and online
co-estimation of odometry and the refractive index of unknown media. This
enables operation in diverse and varying refractive fluids, given only the
camera calibration in air. The refractive index is estimated online as a state
variable of a monocular visual-inertial odometry framework in an iterative
formulation using the proposed camera model. The method was verified on data
collected using an underwater robot traversing inside a pool. The evaluations
demonstrate convergence to the ideal refractive index for water despite
significant perturbations in the initialization. Simultaneously, the approach
enables on-par visual-inertial odometry performance in refractive media without
prior knowledge of the refractive index or requirement of medium-specific

| Influence of dislocations in multilayer graphene stacks: A phase field
  crystal study | K. R. Elder, Zhi-Feng Huang, T. Ala-Nissila |   In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene
stacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a
recently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems
incorporating out-of-plane deformations and parameterized to match to density
functional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems. The
specific configuration considered consists of one monolayer containing four
$5|7$ dislocations (i.e., two dislocation dipoles) sandwiched in between
perfect graphene layers. The study reveals how the strain field from the
dislocations in the defected layer leads to out-of-plane deformations that in
turn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are
made for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a
defect-free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and
system size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by
roughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence
across the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height
profiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.

| PAD-FT: A Lightweight Defense for Backdoor Attacks via Data Purification
  and Fine-Tuning | Yukai Xu, Yujie Gu, Kouichi Sakurai |   Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks,
particularly as recent advancements have led to increasingly subtle
implantation, making the defense more challenging. Existing defense mechanisms
typically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and
involve retraining an auxiliary model or fine-tuning the entire victim model.
However, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always
feasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and
lightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD-FT, that does not require an
additional clean dataset and fine-tunes only a very small part of the model to
disinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a
simple data purification process to identify and select the most-likely clean
data from the poisoned training dataset. The self-purified clean dataset is
then used for activation clipping and fine-tuning only the last classification
layer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation
clipping, and classifier fine-tuning, our mechanism PAD-FT demonstrates
superior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as
confirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.

| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing
  data in Irish sagas | P. MacCarron |   For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts
in order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify
similarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the
significance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture

often impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the
network of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that
the top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent
with central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has
been lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust
to a large random removal of edges.

we prove a structure theorem for $16/7$-power-free ternary rich words. Using
the structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich

| Fitting Multilevel Factor Models | Tetiana Parshakova, Trevor Hastie, Stephen Boyd |   We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance
given by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~\cite{parshakova2023factor}. We
develop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of
the observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and
maintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved
through a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive
definite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of an invertible PSD MLR matrix
is also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the
recursive Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of
the inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky
factorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities,
yielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement. This paper is

| Drifts of the sub-stellar points of the TRAPPIST-1 planets | Revol Alexandre, Émeline Bolmont, Mariana Sastre, Gabriel Tobie, Anne-Sophie Libert, Mathilde Kervazo, Sergi Blanco-Cuaresma |   Accurate modeling of tidal interactions is crucial for interpreting recent
JWST observations of the thermal emissions of TRAPPIST-1~b and c and for
characterizing the surface conditions and potential habitability of the other
planets in the system. Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by
tidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to
their proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the
TRAPPIST-1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In
this work, we present the recent implementation of the co-planar tidal torque
and forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N-body code
Posidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using
a tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of
each planet by taking into account their multi-layer internal structure
computed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets
are not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state.
Planet-planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and
tides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a
result, the sub-stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and
long-timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with
periods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.

evaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of
active nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex
nuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique
is introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed
nuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\sim 8$ for some
nuclei. Significant multi-nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$-shell,
dominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of
magic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on
the path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion.
These results indicate that quantum-computing resources will accelerate
precision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.

| Post-Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a
  massive, rotating object | Lorenzo Iorio |   The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the
general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring
components of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are
analytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level. To the Newtonian
order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as
well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation
in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the
primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first
to 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system
along an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred
close to the Sun's flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due
to the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of
microarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for
the post-Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)
spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of
the latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current
(formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would
bring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the
predicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not
changed by any of the post--Keplerian accelerations considered. The
calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any
alternative models of gravity as well.

| Generalized Robot Learning Framework | Jiahuan Yan, Zhouyang Hong, Yu Zhao, Yu Tian, Yunxin Liu, Travis Davies, Luhui Hu |   Imitation based robot learning has recently gained significant attention in
the robotics field due to its theoretical potential for transferability and
generalizability. However, it remains notoriously costly, both in terms of
hardware and data collection, and deploying it in real-world environments
demands meticulous setup of robots and precise experimental conditions. In this
paper, we present a low-cost robot learning framework that is both easily
reproducible and transferable to various robots and environments. We
demonstrate that deployable imitation learning can be successfully applied even
to industrial-grade robots, not just expensive collaborative robotic arms.
Furthermore, our results show that multi-task robot learning is achievable with
simple network architectures and fewer demonstrations than previously thought
necessary. As the current evaluating method is almost subjective when it comes
to real-world manipulation tasks, we propose Voting Positive Rate (VPR) - a
novel evaluation strategy that provides a more objective assessment of
performance. We conduct an extensive comparison of success rates across various
self-designed tasks to validate our approach. To foster collaboration and
support the robot learning community, we have open-sourced all relevant
datasets and model checkpoints, available at huggingface.co/ZhiChengAI.

| PARAPHRASUS : A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Paraphrase
  Detection Models | Andrianos Michail, Simon Clematide, Juri Opitz |   The task of determining whether two texts are paraphrases has long been a
challenge in NLP. However, the prevailing notion of paraphrase is often quite
simplistic, offering only a limited view of the vast spectrum of paraphrase
phenomena. Indeed, we find that evaluating models in a paraphrase dataset can
leave uncertainty about their true semantic understanding. To alleviate this,
we release paraphrasus, a benchmark designed for multi-dimensional assessment
of paraphrase detection models and finer model selection. We find that
paraphrase detection models under a fine-grained evaluation lens exhibit
trade-offs that cannot be captured through a single classification dataset.

| Dual-Layer Training and Decoding of Large Language Model with
  Simultaneously Thinking and Speaking | Ningyuan Xi, Xiaoyu Wang, Yetao Wu, Teng Chen, Qingqing Gu, Jinxian Qu, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong Chen, Luo Ji |   Large Language Model can reasonably understand and generate human expressions
but may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have
been several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but
most of them are not data-driven or training-based. In this paper, we are
motivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel
model architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts
and then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines
to annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt-response samples, then
add language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We
train the language model by the thoughts-augmented data and successfully let
the thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally
output more reasonable responses. Both qualitative examples and quantitative
results validate the effectiveness and performance of TaS. Our code is
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TadE.

| Artemis: Efficient Commit-and-Prove SNARKs for zkML | Hidde Lycklama, Alexander Viand, Nikolay Avramov, Nicolas Küchler, Anwar Hithnawi |   The widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) in various critical
applications, from healthcare to autonomous systems, has raised significant
concerns about privacy, accountability, and trustworthiness. To address these
concerns, recent research has focused on developing zero-knowledge machine
learning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of
ML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have
substantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily
optimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the
substantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the
model and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new
Commit-and-Prove SNARK (CP-SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that
effectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML
pipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white-box use of the
underlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic
polynomial commitment and only makes black-box use of the proof system. As a
result, Artemis is compatible with state-of-the-art proof systems without
trusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP-SNARKs, evaluate
their performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial
improvements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover
costs and maintaining efficiency even for large-scale models. For example, for
the VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from
11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML
towards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and
complex ML models.

| MMP for Enriques pairs and singular Enriques varieties | Francesco Antonio Denisi, Ángel David Ríos Ortiz, Nikolaos Tsakanikas, Zhixin Xie |   We introduce and study the class of primitive Enriques varieties, whose
smooth members are Enriques manifolds. We provide several examples and we
demonstrate that this class is stable under the operations of the Minimal Model
Program (MMP). In particular, given an Enriques manifold $Y$ and an effective
$\mathbb{R}$-divisor $B_Y$ on $Y$ such that the pair $(Y,B_Y)$ is log
canonical, we prove that any $(K_Y+B_Y)$-MMP terminates with a minimal model
$(Y',B_{Y'})$ of $(Y,B_Y)$, where $Y'$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial primitive
Enriques variety with canonical singularities. Finally, we investigate the
asymptotic theory of Enriques manifolds.

| Numerical renormalization group calculations for magnetic impurity
  systems with spin-orbit coupling and crystal-field effects | Aitor Calvo-Fernández, María Blanco-Rey, Asier Eiguren |   Exploiting symmetries in the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method
significantly enhances performance by improving accuracy, increasing
computational speed, and optimizing memory efficiency. Published codes focus on
continuous rotations and unitary groups, which generally are not applicable to
systems with strong crystal-field effects. The PointGroupNRG code implements
symmetries related to discrete rotation groups, which are defined by the user
in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, together with particle conservation
and spin rotation symmetries. In this paper we present a new version of the
code that extends the available finite groups, previously limited to simply
reducible point groups, in a way that all point and double groups become
accessible. It also includes the full spin-orbital rotation group. Moreover, to
improve the code's flexibility for impurities with complex interactions, this
new version allows to choose between a standard Anderson Hamiltonian for the
impurity or, as another novel feature, an ionic model that requires only the
spectrum and the impurity Lehmann amplitudes.

| Quantum-like nonlinear interferometry with frequency-engineered
  classical light | Romain Dalidet, Anthony Martin, Grégory Sauder, Laurent Labonté, Sébastien Tanzilli |   Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic
entanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits. Nonlinear
optics has served as a workhorse for the generation of entangled photon pairs,
ensuring both energy and phase conservation, but at the cost of limited rate
and degraded signal-to-noise ratio compared to laser-based interferometry
approaches. We present a \"quantum-like\" nonlinear optical method that reaches
super-resolution in single-photon detection regime. This is achieved by
replacing photon-pairs by coherent states of light, mimicking quantum
properties through classical nonlinear optics processes. Our scheme utilizes
two high-brightness lasers. This results in a substantially greater
signal-to-noise ratio compared to its quantum counterpart. Such an approach
paves the way to significantly reduced acquisition times, providing a pathway
to explore signals across a broader range of bandwidth. The need to increase
the frequency bandwidth of the quantum sensor significantly motivates the
potential applications of this pathway.

| A Survey-Based Quantitative Analysis of Stress Factors and Their Impacts
  Among Cybersecurity Professionals | Sunil Arora, John D. Hastings |   This study investigates the prevalence and underlying causes of work-related
stress and burnout among cybersecurity professionals using a quantitative
survey approach guided by the Job Demands-Resources model. Analysis of
responses from 50 cybersecurity practitioners reveals an alarming reality: 44%
report experiencing severe work-related stress and burnout, while an additional
28% are uncertain about their condition. The demanding nature of cybersecurity
roles, unrealistic expectations, and unsupportive organizational cultures
emerge as primary factors fueling this crisis. Notably, 66% of respondents
perceive cybersecurity jobs as more stressful than other IT positions, with 84%
facing additional challenges due to the pandemic and recent high-profile
breaches. The study finds that most cybersecurity experts are reluctant to
report their struggles to management, perpetuating a cycle of silence and
neglect. To address this critical issue, the paper recommends that
organizations foster supportive work environments, implement mindfulness
programs, and address systemic challenges. By prioritizing the mental health of
cybersecurity professionals, organizations can cultivate a more resilient and
effective workforce to protect against an ever-evolving threat landscape.

| Handling Long-Term Safety and Uncertainty in Safe Reinforcement Learning | Jonas Günster, Puze Liu, Jan Peters, Davide Tateo |   Safety is one of the key issues preventing the deployment of reinforcement
learning techniques in real-world robots. While most approaches in the Safe
Reinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and
robot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them
in complex real-world settings. Instead, model-based approaches that
incorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning
framework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on
the real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot
dynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task-specific and hard
to obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to
compute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long-term safety
requirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe
exploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus
on ensuring long-term safety and handling of uncertainty. Our approach is
competitive or superior to state-of-the-art methods in final performance while
maintaining safer behavior during training.

| Quasiperiodic Floquet-Gibbs states in Rydberg atomic systems | Wilson S. Martins, Federico Carollo, Kay Brandner, Igor Lesanovsky |   Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by
fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an
equilibrium-like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet-Magnus
Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi's golden rule, we show
that such Floquet-Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated
Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab-frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function
of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the
system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which
is necessary to uphold high-lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To
corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five
interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate
numerically that the second-order Floquet-Gibbs state of this system is
essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding
Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently
large.

| Understanding the Effects of the Baidu-ULTR Logging Policy on Two-Tower
  Models | Morris de Haan, Philipp Hager |   Despite the popularity of the two-tower model for unbiased learning to rank
(ULTR) tasks, recent work suggests that it suffers from a major limitation that
could lead to its collapse in industry applications: the problem of logging
policy confounding. Several potential solutions have even been proposed;
however, the evaluation of these methods was mostly conducted using
semi-synthetic simulation experiments. This paper bridges the gap between
theory and practice by investigating the confounding problem on the largest
real-world dataset, Baidu-ULTR. Our main contributions are threefold: 1) we
show that the conditions for the confounding problem are given on Baidu-ULTR,
2) the confounding problem bears no significant effect on the two-tower model,
and 3) we point to a potential mismatch between expert annotations, the golden
standard in ULTR, and user click behavior.

we introduce a multilingual conversational dataset, derived from TalkBank,

a significant performance drop across various state-of-the-art ASR models when
tested in conversational settings. Furthermore, we observe a correlation
between Word Error Rate and the presence of speech disfluencies, highlighting
the critical need for more realistic, conversational ASR benchmarks.

| DynaMo: In-Domain Dynamics Pretraining for Visuo-Motor Control | Zichen Jeff Cui, Hengkai Pan, Aadhithya Iyer, Siddhant Haldar, Lerrel Pinto |   Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex
visuomotor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to
thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual
observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual
representations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or
trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present
DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual
representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a
latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of
image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without
augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.
Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet
datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real
environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly
improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised
learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo
hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,
and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and
measure its impact on downstream policy performance. Robot videos are best

models that redefines the conventional predetermined-resolution approach in
visual processing. Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,
which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions
into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to
generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning
with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary
Position Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional
information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for
processing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception
capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL
investigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By
scaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the
amount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive
performance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to
leading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal
benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models. Code is available at

| Bundle Adjustment in the Eager Mode | Zitong Zhan, Huan Xu, Zihang Fang, Xinpeng Wei, Yaoyu Hu, Chen Wang |   Bundle adjustment (BA) is a critical technique in various robotic
applications, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), augmented
reality (AR), and photogrammetry. BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses
and 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance
of deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to
integrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and
performance. However, widely-used C++-based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,
g$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries
like PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of
debugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we
introduce an eager-mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,
providing PyTorch-compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach
includes GPU-accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for
2nd-order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear
solvers. Our eager-mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency,
achieving an average speedup of 18.5$\times$, 22$\times$, and 23$\times$
compared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.

| Massively Multi-Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context | Felix B Mueller, Julian Tanke, Juergen Gall |   Forecasting long-term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of
human behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input
sequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby
people can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene-aware social
transformer model (SAST) to forecast long-term (10s) human motion motion.
Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely
varying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal
convolutional encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer-based bottleneck
that allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model
the conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We
benchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to
16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously. Our model
outperforms other approaches in terms of realism and diversity on different
metrics and in a user study. Code is available at

| SPECTER: An Instrument Concept for CMB Spectral Distortion Measurements
  with Enhanced Sensitivity | Alina Sabyr, Carlos Sierra, J. Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon |   Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a
perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from
fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\mu$-distortion) to late-time
baryonic feedback processes (y-distortion). While the y-distortion can be
detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude
smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a
serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\mu$
arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the
primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here,
we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly
detecting $\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but
with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we
optimize the instrument's configuration to target $\mu$ while robustly
marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike
Fourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their
individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing
significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion at $\approx 5\sigma$ (10$\sigma$)
assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission
duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized
configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular
resolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally
measure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic
correction at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total
thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.

Ringqvist, Dorian Demars, Markus Janson, Mickaël Bonnefoy, Yuhiko Aoyama, Gabriel-Dominique Marleau, Catherine Dougados, Judit Szulágyi, Thanawuth Thanathibodee |   Accretion among planets is a poorly understood phenomenon, due to lack of
both observational and theoretical studies. Detection of emission lines from
accreting gas giants facilitate detailed investigations into this process. This
work presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known
young, planetary-mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf
2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7-21 Mj and age 5-45 Myr, located at 45+-2
pc. We obtained the first high-resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target
with VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near-UV to visible wavelengths (3200-6800
AA). We report resolved H3-H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.
Based on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+-1
km/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR
excess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of
the parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+-63 K and radius to 1.5+-0.1
Rj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet-surface shock model
implies a pre-shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,-40) km/s and a pre-shock
density of log(n0/cm^-3)=14(+0,-5). Pre-shock velocity points to a mass of
6(+8,-4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary
Lline-Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of
1.4(+2.8,-0.9)x10^-8 Mj/yr.

from its predecessor, CodeQwen1.5. This series includes two models:
Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B. As a code-specific model,
Qwen2.5-Coder is built upon the Qwen2.5 architecture and continues pretrained
on a vast corpus of over 5.5 trillion tokens. Through meticulous data cleaning,
scalable synthetic data generation, and balanced data mixing, Qwen2.5-Coder
demonstrates impressive code generation capabilities while retaining general
versatility. The model has been evaluated on a wide range of code-related
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across more than 10
benchmarks, including code generation, completion, reasoning, and repair,
consistently outperforming larger models of the same model size. We believe
that the release of the Qwen2.5-Coder series will not only push the boundaries
of research in code intelligence but also, through its permissive licensing,
encourage broader adoption by developers in real-world applications.

local solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions
it exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong
dynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).
Consequently, it is likely that there are large-scale physical structures
within the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we
present new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a
multi-wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the
M0.8$-$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring-like morphology. We
estimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring to be 79\"
and 154\", respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre
distance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $> 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, a
mass of $\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\odot$, and an expansion speed of $\sim$ 20 km
s$^{-1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($> 10^{51}$ erg) and
momentum ($> 10^7$ M$_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$). We discuss several possible causes
for the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback
and large-scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the
M0.8$-$0.2 ring is a single high-energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain
the observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have
taken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which
we now see as the M0.8$-$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an
extreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.

| To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic
  reasoning | Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett |   Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of
tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted
a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own
evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives
strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with
much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the
answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the
question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic
operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of
CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing
against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic
execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our
results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance
while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond
prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation
across the whole range of LLM applications.

| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs | Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T. Chiu, Siyu Ren, Fei Yuan, Wenting Zhao, Zhiyong Wu, Alexander M. Rush |   Broad textual understanding and in-context learning require language models
that utilize full document contexts. Due to the implementation challenges
associated with directly training long-context models, many methods have been
proposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to
differences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these
approaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long-context
performance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a
controlled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation,
utilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several
insights into long-context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of
perplexity as a general-purpose performance indicator even in longer-context
tasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods
systematically underperform across long-context tasks. Finally, we confirm that
exact fine-tuning based methods are generally effective within the range of
their extension, whereas extrapolation remains challenging. All codebases,
models, and checkpoints will be made available open-source, promoting
transparency and facilitating further research in this critical area of AI
development.

| Finetuning Language Models to Emit Linguistic Expressions of Uncertainty | Arslan Chaudhry, Sridhar Thiagarajan, Dilan Gorur |   Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in information-seeking
and decision-making tasks. Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate
information that conflicts with real-world facts, and their persuasive style
can make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result,
end-users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with
the accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all
outputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore
supervised finetuning on uncertainty-augmented predictions as a method to
develop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty.
Specifically, we measure the calibration of pre-trained models and then
fine-tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of
uncertainty. Through experiments on various question-answering datasets, we
demonstrate that LLMs are well-calibrated in assessing their predictions, and
supervised finetuning based on the model's own confidence leads to
well-calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single-claim
answers.

| Computational Dynamical Systems | Jordan Cotler, Semon Rezchikov |   We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite-dimensional
dynamical systems. Building off of previous work, we give definitions for what
it means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine. We then
show that 'chaotic' dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and
'integrable' dynamical systems (more generally, measure-preserving systems)
cannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines can
be robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, we
show that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable
one-dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and
moreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt.
More broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one 'machine' to simulate
another, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low-complexity 'encoders' and
'decoders' to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system
being simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical
system leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity
theory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.

| Poisson approximate likelihood compared to the particle filter | Yize Hao, Aaron A. Abkemeier, Edward L. Ionides |   Filtering algorithms are fundamental for inference on partially observed
stochastic dynamic systems, since they provide access to the likelihood
function and hence enable likelihood-based or Bayesian inference. A novel
Poisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.
(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering
a fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of
partially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL
is the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large
improvement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,
based on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.
(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should
use PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence
also reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a
shortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that
the comparison of log-likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al. (2023) is
flawed because their PAL calculations were carried out using a dataset scaled
differently from the previous study. If PAL and the particle filter are applied
to the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears. On simulations
where the model is correctly specified, the particle filter outperforms PAL.

| You Only Read Once (YORO): Learning to Internalize Database Knowledge
  for Text-to-SQL | Hideo Kobayashi, Wuwei Lan, Peng Shi, Shuaichen Chang, Jiang Guo, Henghui Zhu, Zhiguo Wang, Patrick Ng |   While significant progress has been made on the text-to-SQL task, recent
solutions repeatedly encode the same database schema for every question,
resulting in unnecessary high inference cost and often overlooking crucial
database knowledge. To address these issues, we propose You Only Read Once
(YORO), a novel paradigm that directly internalizes database knowledge into the
parametric knowledge of a text-to-SQL model during training and eliminates the
need for schema encoding during inference. YORO significantly reduces the input
token length by 66%-98%. Despite its shorter inputs, our empirical results
demonstrate YORO's competitive performances with traditional systems on three
benchmarks as well as its significant outperformance on large databases.
Furthermore, YORO excels in handling questions with challenging value
retrievals such as abbreviation.

| Ergodic properties of infinite extension of symmetric interval exchange
  transformations | Przemysław Berk, Frank Trujillo, Hao Wu |   We prove that skew products with the cocycle given by the function
$f(x)=a(x-1/2)$ with $a\neq 0$ are ergodic for every ergodic symmetric IET in
the base, thus giving the full characterization of ergodic extensions in this
family. Moreover, we prove that under an additional natural assumption of
unique ergodicity on the IET, we can replace $f$ with any differentiable
function with a non-zero sum of jumps. Finally, by considering weakly mixing
IETs instead of just ergodic, we show that the skew products with cocycle given
by $f$ have infinite ergodic index.

| multiPI-TransBTS: A Multi-Path Learning Framework for Brain Tumor Image
  Segmentation Based on Multi-Physical Information | Hongjun Zhu, Jiaohang Huang, Kuo Chen, Xuehui Ying, Ying Qian |   Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis,
treatment planning, and monitoring the progression of brain tumors. However,
due to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across
different MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In
this study, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework, multiPI-TransBTS,
which integrates multi-physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.
The model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi-modal
imaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor
characteristics. The multiPI-TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an
Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi-source, multi-scale feature
decoder. The encoder incorporates a multi-branch architecture to separately
extract modality-specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module
fuses information from multiple sources using channel-wise and element-wise
attention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both
common and task-specific features through a Task-Specific Feature Introduction
(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),
Tumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on
the BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of
multiPI-TransBTS over the state-of-the-art methods. The model consistently
achieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,
highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results
also indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision
and recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a
significant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving
clinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.

| Synchrotron self-Compton in a radiative-adiabatic fireball scenario:
  Modelling the multiwavelength observations in some Fermi/LAT bursts | Nissim Fraija, P. Veres, B. Betancourt Kamenetskaia, A. Galvan-Gamez, M. G. Dainotti, Simone Dichiara, R. L. Becerra |   Energetic GeV photons expected from the closest and the most energetic
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provide an unique opportunity to study the
very-high-energy emission as well as the possible correlations with lower
energy bands in realistic GRB afterglow models. In the standard GRB afterglow
model, the relativistic homogeneous shock is usually considered to be fully
adiabatic, however, it could be partially radiative. Based on the external
forward-shock scenario in both stellar wind and constant-density medium. We
present a radiative-adiabatic analytical model of the synchrotron self-Compton
(SSC) and synchrotron processes considering an electron energy distribution
with a power-law index of 1 < p < 2 and 2 $\leq$ p. We show that the SSC
scenario plays a relevant role in the radiative parameter $\epsilon$, leading
to a prolonged evolution during the slow cooling regime. In a particular case,
we derive the Fermi/LAT light curves together with the photons with energies
$\geq$ 100 MeV in a sample of nine bursts from the second Fermi/LAT GRB catalog
that exhibited temporal and spectral indices with $\geq$ 1.5 and $\approx$ 2,
respectively. These events can hardly be described with closure relations of
the standard synchrotron afterglow model, and also exhibit energetic photons
above the synchrotron limit. We have modeled the multi-wavelength observations
of our sample to constrain the microphysical parameters, the circumburst
density, the bulk Lorentz factor and the mechanism responsible for explaining
the energetic GeV photons.

| Blind Deconvolution on Graphs: Exact and Stable Recovery | Chang Ye, Gonzalo Mateos |   We study a blind deconvolution problem on graphs, which arises in the context
of localizing a few sources that diffuse over networks. While the observations
are bilinear functions of the unknown graph filter coefficients and sparse
input signals, a mild requirement on invertibility of the diffusion filter
enables an efficient convex relaxation leading to a linear programming
formulation that can be tackled with off-the-shelf solvers. Under the
Bernoulli-Gaussian model for the inputs, we derive sufficient exact recovery
conditions in the noise-free setting. A stable recovery result is then
established, ensuring the estimation error remains manageable even when the
observations are corrupted by a small amount of noise. Numerical tests with
synthetic and real-world network data illustrate the merits of the proposed
algorithm, its robustness to noise as well as the benefits of leveraging
multiple signals to aid the (blind) localization of sources of diffusion. At a
fundamental level, the results presented here broaden the scope of classical
blind deconvolution of (spatio-)temporal signals to irregular graph domains.

| Generalized compression and compressive search of large datasets | Morgan E. Prior, Thomas Howard III, Emily Light, Najib Ishaq, Noah M. Daniels |   The Big Data explosion has necessitated the development of search algorithms
that scale sub-linearly in time and memory.
  While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently,
few algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain-specific.
  We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to
perform $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search on compressed data while only decompressing
a small, relevant, portion of the data.
  panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low-dimensional
structure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.
  panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between
two points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in
terms of the other.
  This property holds for many widely-used distance functions, e.g. string edit
distances (Levenshtein, Needleman-Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures
(Jaccard, Dice, etc.).
  We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic,
and set data.
  We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the
compressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.
  panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering
sub-linear time performance for $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search.
  We conclude that panCAKES is an efficient, general-purpose algorithm for
exact compressive search on large datasets that obey the manifold hypothesis.
  We provide an open-source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming
language.

| WeHelp: A Shared Autonomy System for Wheelchair Users | Abulikemu Abuduweili, Alice Wu, Tianhao Wei, Weiye Zhao |   There is a large population of wheelchair users. Most of the wheelchair users
need help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs
are not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this
project, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair
users. A robot with a WeHelp system has three modes, following mode, remote
control mode and tele-operation mode. In the following mode, the robot follows
the wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can
ask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the
wheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech
recognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode.
In the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy
stick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs,
such as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high
shelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant
takes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks
for their needs. Our evaluation shows that the pipeline is useful and practical
for wheelchair users. Source code and demo of the paper are available at

| Identifying inflated Fermi surfaces via thermoelectric response in
  $d$-wave superconductor heterostructure | Amartya Pal, Paramita Dutta, Arijit Saha |   We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric response of inflated Fermi
surfaces (IFSs) generated in a two dimensional unconventional $d$-wave
superconductor subjected to an external in-plane Zeeman field. These IFSs
exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are
topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the
Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave
superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients
including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and
examine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage
and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of
$d$-wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the
normal-superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric
response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in
Seebeck coefficient ($\sim 200\,\mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($\sim 3.5$) due to the
generation of the IFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for
device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by
computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice-regularized
version of our continuum model.

| JEAN: Joint Expression and Audio-guided NeRF-based Talking Face
  Generation | Sai Tanmay Reddy Chakkera, Aggelina Chatziagapi, Dimitris Samaras |   We introduce a novel method for joint expression and audio-guided talking
face generation. Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker
identity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these
challenges, we propose a NeRF-based network. Since we train our network on
monocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn
disentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio
features in a self-supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects.
By incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned
audio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle
motion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer-based architecture
that learns expression features, capturing long-range facial expressions and
disentangling them from the speech-specific mouth movements. Through
quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-fidelity talking face videos, achieving state-of-the-art facial
expression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.

| Autopet III challenge: Incorporating anatomical knowledge into nnUNet
  for lesion segmentation in PET/CT | Hamza Kalisch, Fabian Hörst, Ken Herrmann, Jens Kleesiek, Constantin Seibold |   Lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging is essential for precise tumor
characterization, which supports personalized treatment planning and enhances
diagnostic precision in oncology. However, accurate manual segmentation of
lesions is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. Given the
rising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods,
particularly deep-learning-based approaches, have become increasingly more
relevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation
of tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting,
addressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable
solutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET
challenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers
(FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers. To this extent, we developed a
classifier that identifies the tracer of the given PET/CT based on the Maximum
Intensity Projection of the PET scan. We trained two individual
nnUNet-ensembles for each tracer where anatomical labels are included as a
multi-label task to enhance the model's performance. Our final submission
achieves cross-validation Dice scores of 76.90% and 61.33% for the publicly
available FDG and PSMA datasets, respectively. The code is available at

| Robots that Learn to Safely Influence via Prediction-Informed
  Reach-Avoid Dynamic Games | Ravi Pandya, Changliu Liu, Andrea Bajcsy |   Robots can influence people to accomplish their tasks more efficiently:
autonomous cars can inch forward at an intersection to pass through, and
tabletop manipulators can go for an object on the table first. However, a
robot's ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if
naively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach-avoid
dynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a
safety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human's behavior
as goal-driven but conditioned on the robot's plan, enabling us to capture
influence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical
and belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in
human behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE
(Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high-dimensional
(39-D) simulated human-robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline
game-theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust
baseline that treats the human as a worst-case adversary, a safety controller
that does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy-function-based
safety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage
the influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing
the robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate
during task execution.

| Decoding Style: Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Image-Guided Outfit
  Recommendation with Preference | Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan |   Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding
both fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper
presents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large
language models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their \"black box\" and static
nature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item
visual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style
and color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis
for personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the
open-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability
to recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative
examples is employed to enhance the LLM's decision-making process. This creates
a self-enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in
line with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore
dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill-in-the-blank,
and complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework's
ability to generate stylish, trend-aligned outfit suggestions, continuously
improving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our
proposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more
cohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the
proposed framework's potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate
suggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit
generation.

  Resonators | Philip Andrango, Hailin Wang |   We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier-Stark ladders of
diamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with
ultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin
properties. Three nearest-neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric
configurations and a large range of coupling rates have been explored for the
realization of Wannier-Stark ladders of LWRs, potentially enabling long-range
connectivity between spin qubits through their interactions with mechanical
vibrations. Additional analysis on the effects of disorder indicates that the
proposed Wannier-Stark ladder can be robust against realistic experimental
imperfections. The development of mechanical quantum networks of spin qubits
with long-range connectivity can open the door to the implementation of newly

| MAgICoRe: Multi-Agent, Iterative, Coarse-to-Fine Refinement for
  Reasoning | Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Archiki Prasad, Swarnadeep Saha, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal |   Large Language Models' (LLM) reasoning can be improved using test-time
aggregation strategies, i.e., generating multiple samples and voting among
generated samples. While these improve performance, they often reach a
saturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated
feedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key
challenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can
over-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and
address errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to
identify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding
how many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too
soon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose
MAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty
as easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard
ones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error
localization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores.
Moreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with
three agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on
step-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure
sufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating
further rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5
and show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of
MAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by
4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with
baselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our
ablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe's RMs and multi-agent
communication.

| Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka |   Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string
processing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into
blocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence
of a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another
occurrence earlier in $T$. Due to numerous applications, LZ77 factorization is
one of the most studied problems on strings. In the 47 years since its
inception, several algorithms were developed for different models of
computation, including parallel, GPU, external-memory, and quantum. Remarkably,
however, the complexity of the most basic variant is still not settled: All
existing algorithms in the RAM model run in $\Omega(n)$ time, which is a
$\Theta(\log n)$ factor away from the lower bound of $\Omega(n/\log n)$
(following from the necessity to read the input, which takes $\Theta(n/\log n)$
space for $T\in\{0,1\}^{n}$).
  We present the first $o(n)$-time algorithm for LZ77 factorization, breaking
the linear-time barrier present for nearly 50 years. For $T\in\{0,1\}^{n}$, our
algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(n/\sqrt{\log n})=o(n)$ time and uses the optimal
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log n)$ working space. Our algorithm generalizes to
$\Sigma=[0..\sigma)$, where $\sigma=n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The runtime and
working space then become $\mathcal{O}((n\log\sigma)/\sqrt{\log n})$ and
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma} n)$. To obtain our algorithm, we prove a more
general result: For any constant $\epsilon\in(0,1)$ and $T\in[0..\sigma)^{n}$,
in $\mathcal{O}((n\log\sigma)/\sqrt{\log n})$ time and using
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma}n)$ space, we can construct an
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma}n)$-size index that, given any $P=T[j..j+\ell)$
(represented as $(j,\ell)$), computes the leftmost occurrence of $P$ in $T$ in
$\mathcal{O}(\log^{\epsilon}n)$ time. In other words, we solve the
indexing/online variant of the LZ77 problem.

replace traditional search engines for information retrieval and product
discovery. This raises concerns about monetization strategies and the potential
for subtle consumer manipulation. Companies may have financial incentives to
steer users toward search results or products in a conversation in ways that
are unnoticeable to consumers. Using a behavioral experiment, we show that
conversational AI models can indeed significantly shift consumer preferences.
We discuss implications and ask whether regulators are sufficiently prepared to
combat potential consumer deception.

  isotopes on machine learning mass modeling | W. S. Porter, B. Liu, D. Ray, A. A. Valverde, M. Li, M. R. Mumpower, M. Brodeur, D. P. Burdette, N. Callahan, A. Cannon, J. A. Clark, D. E. M. Hoff, A. M. Houff, F. G. Kondev, A. E. Lovell, A. T. Mohan, G. E. Morgan, C. Quick, G. Savard, K. S. Sharma, T. M. Sprouse, L. Varriano |   Atomic masses are a foundational quantity in our understanding of nuclear
structure, astrophysics and fundamental symmetries. The long-standing goal of
creating a predictive global model for the binding energy of a nucleus remains
a significant challenge, however, and prompts the need for precise measurements
of atomic masses to serve as anchor points for model developments. We present
precise mass measurements of neutron-rich Ru and Pd isotopes performed at the
Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade facility at Argonne National
Laboratory using the Canadian Penning Trap mass spectrometer. The masses of
$^{108}$Ru, $^{110}$Ru and $^{116}$Pd were measured to a relative mass
precision $\delta m/m \approx 10^{-8}$ via the phase-imaging
ion-cyclotron-resonance technique, and represent an improvement of
approximately an order of magnitude over previous measurements. These mass data
were used in conjunction with the physically interpretable machine learning
(PIML) model, which uses a mixture density neural network to model mass
excesses via a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The effects of our new mass
data on a Bayesian-updating of a PIML model are presented.

| MoRAG -- Multi-Fusion Retrieval Augmented Generation for Human Motion | Kalakonda Sai Shashank, Shubh Maheshwari, Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla |   We introduce MoRAG, a novel multi-part fusion based retrieval-augmented
generation strategy for text-based human motion generation. The method enhances
motion diffusion models by leveraging additional knowledge obtained through an
improved motion retrieval process. By effectively prompting large language
models (LLMs), we address spelling errors and rephrasing issues in motion
retrieval. Our approach utilizes a multi-part retrieval strategy to improve the
generalizability of motion retrieval across the language space. We create
diverse samples through the spatial composition of the retrieved motions.
Furthermore, by utilizing low-level, part-specific motion information, we can
construct motion samples for unseen text descriptions. Our experiments
demonstrate that our framework can serve as a plug-and-play module, improving
the performance of motion diffusion models. Code, pretrained models and sample
videos will be made available at: https://motion-rag.github.io/

| Takin: A Cohort of Superior Quality Zero-shot Speech Generation Models |  EverestAI,  :, Sijin Chen, Yuan Feng, Laipeng He, Tianwei He, Wendi He, Yanni Hu, Bin Lin, Yiting Lin, Pengfei Tan, Chengwei Tian, Chen Wang, Zhicheng Wang, Ruoye Xie, Jingjing Yin, Jianhao Ye, Jixun Yao, Quanlei Yan, Yuguang Yang |   With the advent of the big data and large language model era, zero-shot
personalized rapid customization has emerged as a significant trend. In this
report, we introduce Takin AudioLLM, a series of techniques and models, mainly
including Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, specifically designed for
audiobook production. These models are capable of zero-shot speech production,
generating high-quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human
speech and facilitating individuals to customize the speech content according
to their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec
language model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a
multi-task training framework, capable of generating high-fidelity natural
speech in a zero-shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and
timbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while
advocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its
naturalness and expressiveness. Last, we propose the Takin Morphing system with
highly decoupled and advanced timbre and prosody modeling approaches, which
enables individuals to customize speech production with their preferred timbre
and prosody in a precise and controllable manner. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness and robustness of our Takin AudioLLM series models.

to sparse computation through expert routing, selectively activating only a
small subset of expert modules. However, sparse computation challenges
traditional training practices, as discrete expert routing hinders standard
backpropagation and thus gradient-based optimization, which are the cornerstone
of deep learning. To better pursue the scaling power of MoE, we introduce GRIN
(GRadient-INformed MoE training), which incorporates sparse gradient estimation
for expert routing and configures model parallelism to avoid token dropping.
Applying GRIN to autoregressive language modeling, we develop a top-2
16$\times$3.8B MoE model. Our model, with only 6.6B activated parameters,
outperforms a 7B dense model and matches the performance of a 14B dense model
trained on the same data. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks
demonstrate the potential of GRIN to significantly enhance MoE efficacy,
achieving 79.4 on MMLU, 83.7 on HellaSwag, 74.4 on HumanEval, and 58.9 on MATH.

| BERT-VBD: Vietnamese Multi-Document Summarization Framework | Tuan-Cuong Vuong, Trang Mai Xuan, Thien Van Luong |   In tackling the challenge of Multi-Document Summarization (MDS), numerous
methods have been proposed, spanning both extractive and abstractive
summarization techniques. However, each approach has its own limitations,
making it less effective to rely solely on either one. An emerging and
promising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractive
summarization methods. Despite the plethora of studies in this domain, research
on the combined methodology remains scarce, particularly in the context of
Vietnamese language processing. This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDS
framework leveraging a two-component pipeline architecture that integrates
extractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs an
extractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This is
achieved by a modification of the pre-trained BERT network, which derives
semantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet network
structures. The second component utilizes the VBD-LLaMA2-7B-50b model for
abstractive summarization, ultimately generating the final summary document.
Our proposed framework demonstrates a positive performance, attaining ROUGE-2
scores of 39.6% on the VN-MDS dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art
baselines.

| Einstein-dilaton-four-Maxwell Holographic Anisotropic Models | Irina Ya. Aref'eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov |   In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the
five-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell models has played a crucial role.
Typically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while
additional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A
more general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field
represents spatial longitudinal-transverse anisotropy, while the third and
fourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We
consider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero
temperature and five functions at non-zero temperature. Maxwell field related
to the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,
whereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.
We demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of
the seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations -- either the
dilaton or the vector potential equation -- follows from the Einstein equations
and the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi
identity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress-energy
tensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is
provided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to
three Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis
shows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein
equations and the equation for the vector potential

| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components
  for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco-Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram |   Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data
together with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal
components used. It is therefore important to determine the number of
significant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a
variational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for
estimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of
samples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This
eliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of
principal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.
This framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows
and columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),
and with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data
with arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as
cultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our
method on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may
underestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the
synthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical
dataset. These results suggest that it is broadly applicable across the life
sciences.

| Linguini: A benchmark for language-agnostic linguistic reasoning | Eduardo Sánchez, Belen Alastruey, Christophe Ropers, Pontus Stenetorp, Mikel Artetxe, Marta R. Costa-jussà |   We propose a new benchmark to measure a language model's linguistic reasoning
skills without relying on pre-existing language-specific knowledge. The test
covers 894 questions grouped in 160 problems across 75 (mostly) extremely
low-resource languages, extracted from the International Linguistic Olympiad
corpus. To attain high accuracy on this benchmark, models don't need previous
knowledge of the tested language, as all the information needed to solve the
linguistic puzzle is presented in the context. We find that, while all analyzed
models rank below 25% accuracy, there is a significant gap between open and
closed models, with the best-performing proprietary model at 24.05% and the
best-performing open model at 8.84%.

| From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the
  primordial black hole reheating scenario | Guillem Domènech, Jan Tränkle |   We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs
originate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight
PBHs with masses $M\lesssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat
it via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate
whether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH
reheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the
initial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer
functions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and
isocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation
of state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH
dominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the
spectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive
to $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density
fluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance
as a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
observations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the
initial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we
find that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several
future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas,
especially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any
early matter-dominated universe scenario.

| Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules | Anqi Zhang, Wilson S. Geisler |   Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We
investigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented
displays having well-separated potential target-object locations. Performance
was compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption
that the information from the different potential target locations is
statistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than
optimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the
implausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show
that three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical
results. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near
optimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the
central potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise
causes search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These
findings have far-reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks
and other identification tasks in humans and other animals.

| Far-from-equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann
  approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows
  $v_n$ | Vincenzo Nugara, Vincenzo Greco, Salvatore Plumari |   We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal
system in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution
function and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system
sizes $R$ and interaction strength $\eta/s$ and identify universality classes
based upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each
of this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $\hat
\gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results
highlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum
moments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to
a 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of
different sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a
similar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse
flow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system
size and $\eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and
their response functions, along with the impact of the $\eta/s$ and the system
transverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in
momentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow
$v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of
large opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems
evolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play
in this process.

Qwen2.5-Math and Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct-1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the
Qwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self-improvement
throughout the entire pipeline, from pre-training and post-training to
inference: (1) During the pre-training phase, Qwen2-Math-Instruct is utilized
to generate large-scale, high-quality mathematical data. (2) In the
post-training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive
sampling from Qwen2-Math-Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative
evolution of data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model,
it's possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the
next round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the
ultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct.
(3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling,
optimizing the model's performance.
  Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced
mathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics
datasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and
AIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math
competition problems.

| Computing the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two-Dimensional
  Strongly-Correlated Systems | Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn |   We show that the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time-reversal
invariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary-condition
dependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non-interacting and
strongly-correlated insulators. By introducing a family of quasi-single
particle states associated to the many-body ground state of an insulator, we
show that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant can be expressed as the integral of a
certain Berry connection over half the space of boundary conditions, providing
an alternative expression to the formulations that appear in [Lee et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. $\textbf{100}$, 186807 (2008)]. We show the equivalence of the
different many-body formulations of the invariant, and show how they reduce to
known band-theoretic results for Slater determinant ground states. Finally, we
apply our results to analytically calculate the invariant for the Kane-Mele
model with nonlocal (orbital) Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) interactions. This
rigorously establishes the topological nontriviality of the Kane-Mele model
with HK interactions, and represents one of the few exact calculations of the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a strongly-interacting system.

| Weak Lensing analysis of Abell 2390 using short exposures | A. Dutta, J. R. Peterson, T. Rose, M. Cianfaglione, A. Bonafede, G. Li, G. Sembroski |   We present a weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 2390 at z =
0.23 using second moment shape measurements made in 411 short 60s exposures.
The exposures are obtained in three broadband photometric filters (g, r, i)
using WIYN-ODI. Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a
moment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching
algorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The
measurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight
to obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim
simulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find
the mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We
also find the E-Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic
structures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical
and X-Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to
map large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of
the cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the
peaks are similar to X-Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster
and show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.

  Speech LLM Training and Inference | Edresson Casanova, Ryan Langman, Paarth Neekhara, Shehzeen Hussain, Jason Li, Subhankar Ghosh, Ante Jukić, Sang-gil Lee |   Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing
through audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the

present the Low Frame-rate Speech Codec (LFSC): a neural audio codec that
leverages finite scalar quantization and adversarial training with large speech
language models to achieve high-quality audio compression with a 1.89 kbps
bitrate and 21.5 frames per second. We demonstrate that our novel codec can

| Stronger Baseline Models -- A Key Requirement for Aligning Machine
  Learning Research with Clinical Utility | Nathan Wolfrath, Joel Wolfrath, Hengrui Hu, Anjishnu Banerjee, Anai N. Kothari |   Machine Learning (ML) research has increased substantially in recent years,
due to the success of predictive modeling across diverse application domains.
However, well-known barriers exist when attempting to deploy ML models in
high-stakes, clinical settings, including lack of model transparency (or the
inability to audit the inference process), large training data requirements
with siloed data sources, and complicated metrics for measuring model utility.
In this work, we show empirically that including stronger baseline models in
healthcare ML evaluations has important downstream effects that aid
practitioners in addressing these challenges. Through a series of case studies,
we find that the common practice of omitting baselines or comparing against a
weak baseline model (e.g. a linear model with no optimization) obscures the
value of ML methods proposed in the research literature. Using these insights,
we propose some best practices that will enable practitioners to more
effectively study and deploy ML models in clinical settings.

| Revisiting Dark Photon Constraints from CMB Spectral Distortions | Jens Chluba, Bryce Cyr, Matthew C. Johnson |   Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide
stringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post-BBN (Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models
with COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.
Here, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark
photon conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous
works only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the
change to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon
distortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the
distortion has an opposite sign and a $\simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We
furthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover
the redshift range $\simeq 2\times 10^6-4\times 10^7$ between the $\mu$-era and
the end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints
for dark photon masses in the range $10^{-4}\,{\rm eV}\lesssim m_{\rm
dp}\lesssim 10^{-3}\,{\rm eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We
demonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon
to dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $\mu$-type distortion
independent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study
dark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with
CMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.

| Bi-objective trail-planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous
  environment | Cory M. Simon, Jeffrey Richley, Lucas Overbey, Darleen Perez-Lavin |   Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in
resource delivery, patrolling, information-gathering, agriculture, forest fire
fighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and
search-and-rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments -- with e.g.
rough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or
capturing robots -- should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of
risks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should
take the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the
team-level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward
from visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider
bi-objective trail-planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a
hazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed
graph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of
survival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a
robot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for
the Pareto-optimal robot-team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team
objectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive
the mission. A human decision-maker can then select trail plans that balance,
according to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony
optimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto-optimal set of
robot team trail plans. As a case study, we illustrate with an
information-gathering mission in an art museum.

| Pareto Data Framework: Steps Towards Resource-Efficient Decision Making
  Using Minimum Viable Data (MVD) | Tashfain Ahmed, Josh Siegel |   This paper introduces the Pareto Data Framework, an approach for identifying
and selecting the Minimum Viable Data (MVD) required for enabling machine
learning applications on constrained platforms such as embedded systems, mobile
devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We demonstrate that strategic
data reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing
bandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies
Minimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource-constrained
environments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient
practices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and
overprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for
optimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data
representation. An experimental methodology demonstrates effective acoustic
data characterization after downsampling, quantization, and truncation to
simulate reduced-fidelity sensors and network and storage constraints; results
shows that performance can be maintained up to 95\% with sample rates reduced
by 75\% and bit depths and clip length reduced by 50\% which translates into
substantial cost and resource reduction. These findings have implications on
the design and development of constrained systems. The paper also discusses
broader implications of the framework, including the potential to democratize
advanced AI technologies across IoT applications and sectors such as
agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing to improve access and multiply
the benefits of data-driven insights.

| Applications of Knowledge Distillation in Remote Sensing: A Survey | Yassine Himeur, Nour Aburaed, Omar Elharrouss, Iraklis Varlamis, Shadi Atalla, Wathiq Mansoor, Hussain Al Ahmad |   With the ever-growing complexity of models in the field of remote sensing
(RS), there is an increasing demand for solutions that balance model accuracy
with computational efficiency. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a
powerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,
complex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in
performance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and
its innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer
knowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact
and efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application
across various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and
historical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are
highlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational
efficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical
deployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of
KD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the
breadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case
studies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,
such as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review
discusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical
constraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive
overview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS. Through this
organization, the paper not only elucidates the current state of research in KD
but also sets the stage for future research opportunities, thereby contributing
significantly to both academic research and real-world applications.

function properly. Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing
evidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,
these growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,
more and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth-dependent systems
and develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of
'growth dependence' still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,
which impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article
proposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the
concept of 'growth dependence' across socio-economic systems. We provide a
general definition consisting of four components that can be specified for
different empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of
measurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions
or properties of the system under investigation. According to our general
definition, a socio-economic system is growth-dependent if it requires a
long-term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to
maintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen
normative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to
three areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:
employment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies
demonstrate that whether or not a system is growth-dependent hinges not only on
the empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of
the concept of growth dependence. Our framework enables coherent, robust and
effective definitions and research questions, fostering comparability of
findings across different cases and disciplines.

procedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognition
of surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesion
characteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real-time
surgical phase recognition algorithms. Existing surgical phase recognition
algorithms struggle to efficiently capture temporal contexts in video-based
scenarios, leading to insufficient performance. To address these issues, we
propose SPRMamba, a novel Mamba-based framework for ESD surgical phase
recognition. SPRMamba leverages the strengths of Mamba for long-term temporal
modeling while introducing the Scaled Residual TranMamba block to enhance the
capture of fine-grained details, overcoming the limitations of traditional
temporal models like Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformers.
Moreover, a Temporal Sample Strategy is introduced to accelerate the
processing, which is essential for real-time phase recognition in clinical
settings. Extensive testing on the ESD385 dataset and the cholecystectomy
Cholec80 dataset demonstrates that SPRMamba surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits greater robustness across various surgical phase
recognition tasks.

| Who's the GOAT? Sports Rankings and Data-Driven Random Walks on the
  Symmetric Group | Gian-Gabriel P. Garcia, J. Carlos Martínez Mori |   Given a collection of historical sports rankings, can one tell which player
is the greatest of all time (i.e., the GOAT)? In this work, we design a
data-driven random walk on the symmetric group to obtain a stationary
distribution over player rankings, spanning across different time periods in
sports history. We combine this distribution with a notion of stochastic
dominance to obtain a partial order over the players. We implement our methods
using publicly available data from the Association of Tennis Professionals
(ATP) and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) to find the GOATs in the
respective categories.

| Measuring Human and AI Values based on Generative Psychometrics with
  Large Language Models | Haoran Ye, Yuhang Xie, Yuanyi Ren, Hanjun Fang, Xin Zhang, Guojie Song |   Human values and their measurement are long-standing interdisciplinary
inquiry. Recent advances in AI have sparked renewed interest in this area, with
large language models (LLMs) emerging as both tools and subjects of value
measurement. This work introduces Generative Psychometrics for Values (GPV), an
LLM-based, data-driven value measurement paradigm, theoretically grounded in
text-revealed selective perceptions. We begin by fine-tuning an LLM for
accurate perception-level value measurement and verifying the capability of
LLMs to parse texts into perceptions, forming the core of the GPV pipeline.
Applying GPV to human-authored blogs, we demonstrate its stability, validity,
and superiority over prior psychological tools. Then, extending GPV to LLM
value measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometric
methodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free-form
outputs, enabling context-specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis of
measurement paradigms, indicating response biases of prior methods; and 3) an
attempt to bridge LLM values and their safety, revealing the predictive power
of different value systems and the impacts of various values on LLM safety.
Through interdisciplinary efforts, we aim to leverage AI for next-generation
psychometrics and psychometrics for value-aligned AI.

| FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated
  Long-Tailed Learning | Xiuhua Lu, Peng Li, Xuefeng Jiang |   Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy
in distributed machine learning. However, datasets distributed across each
client in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can
be globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly
affects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated
learning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it
fails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data.
This results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting
the equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a
methodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,
we propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the
local training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred
optimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state-of-the-art
methods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed
distribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10-LT and
CIFAR-100-LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of
model performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long-tailed
distribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.

| Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error
  Detection | Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia |   Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications. Doing
so requires overcoming the noise present on today's hardware. The quantum
approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling
up due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup
over state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems. However,
achieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require
fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant
implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection
code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the
algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with
up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we
propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance, and use it
to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance
to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our
model can be used to determine necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform
Goemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware. Our results demonstrate the
largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially
fault-tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date,
paving the way towards solving real-world applications with quantum computers.

| Cyclicity Analysis of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process | Vivek Kaushik |   In this thesis, we consider an $N$-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)
process satisfying the linear stochastic differential equation $d\mathbf x(t) =
- \mathbf B\mathbf x(t) dt + \boldsymbol \Sigma d \mathbf w(t).$ Here, $\mathbf
B$ is a fixed $N \times N$ circulant friction matrix whose eigenvalues have
positive real parts, $\boldsymbol \Sigma$ is a fixed $N \times M$ matrix. We
consider a signal propagation model governed by this OU process. In this model,
an underlying signal propagates throughout a network consisting of $N$ linked
sensors located in space. We interpret the $n$-th component of the OU process
as the measurement of the propagating effect made by the $n$-th sensor. The
matrix $\mathbf B$ represents the sensor network structure: if $\mathbf B$ has
first row $(b_1 \ , \ \dots \ , \ b_N),$ where $b_1>0$ and $b_2 \ , \ \dots \
,\ b_N \le 0,$ then the magnitude of $b_p$ quantifies how receptive the $n$-th
sensor is to activity within the $(n+p-1)$-th sensor. Finally, the $(m,n)$-th
entry of the matrix $\mathbf D = \frac{\boldsymbol \Sigma \boldsymbol
\Sigma^\text T}{2}$ is the covariance of the component noises injected into the
$m$-th and $n$-th sensors. For different choices of $\mathbf B$ and
$\boldsymbol \Sigma,$ we investigate whether Cyclicity Analysis enables us to
recover the structure of network. Roughly speaking, Cyclicity Analysis studies
the lead-lag dynamics pertaining to the components of a multivariate signal. We
specifically consider an $N \times N$ skew-symmetric matrix $\mathbf Q,$ known
as the lead matrix, in which the sign of its $(m,n)$-th entry captures the
lead-lag relationship between the $m$-th and $n$-th component OU processes. We
investigate whether the structure of the leading eigenvector of $\mathbf Q,$
the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of $\mathbf Q$ in
modulus, reflects the network structure induced by $\mathbf B.$

| Symmetry-Enriched Learning: A Category-Theoretic Framework for Robust
  Machine Learning Models | Ronald Katende |   This manuscript presents a novel framework that integrates higher-order
symmetries and category theory into machine learning. We introduce new
mathematical constructs, including hyper-symmetry categories and functorial
representations, to model complex transformations within learning algorithms.
Our contributions include the design of symmetry-enriched learning models, the
development of advanced optimization techniques leveraging categorical
symmetries, and the theoretical analysis of their implications for model
robustness, generalization, and convergence. Through rigorous proofs and
practical applications, we demonstrate that incorporating higher-dimensional
categorical structures enhances both the theoretical foundations and practical
capabilities of modern machine learning algorithms, opening new directions for

| Brain-Streams: fMRI-to-Image Reconstruction with Multi-modal Guidance | Jaehoon Joo, Taejin Jeong, Seongjae Hwang |   Understanding how humans process visual information is one of the crucial
steps for unraveling the underlying mechanism of brain activity. Recently, this
curiosity has motivated the fMRI-to-image reconstruction task; given the fMRI
data from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual
stimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent
Diffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex
visual stimuli such as high-resolution natural images from vision datasets.
Despite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often
lack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.
Consequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere
visuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs
effectively incorporate multi-modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,
and image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image
generations. Specifically, inspired by the two-streams hypothesis suggesting
that perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain
regions, our framework, Brain-Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain
regions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from
semantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information
regions, Brain-Streams provides accurate multi-modal guidance to LDMs. We
validate the reconstruction ability of Brain-Streams both quantitatively and
qualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI
data.

| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal
  execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huyên Pham |   Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and
constraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity
markets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general
propagator model under linear functional inequality constraints. The optimal
control is given explicitly in terms of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers
and their conditional expectations, as a solution to a linear stochastic
Fredholm equation. We propose a stochastic version of the Uzawa algorithm on
the dual problem to construct the stochastic Lagrange multipliers numerically
via a stochastic projected gradient ascent, combined with a least-squares Monte
Carlo regression step to approximate their conditional expectations. We
illustrate our findings on two different practical applications with stochastic
signals: (i) an optimal execution problem with an exponential or a power law
decaying transient impact, with either a `no-shorting' constraint in the
presence of a `sell' signal, a `no-buying' constraint in the presence of a
`buy' signal or a stochastic `stop-trading' constraint whenever the exogenous
price drops below a specified reference level; (ii) a battery storage problem
with instantaneous operating costs, seasonal signals and fixed constraints on
both the charging power and the load capacity of the battery.

| Skill matching at scale: freelancer-project alignment for efficient
  multilingual candidate retrieval | Warren Jouanneau, Marc Palyart, Emma Jouffroy |   Finding the perfect match between a job proposal and a set of freelancers is
not an easy task to perform at scale, especially in multiple languages. In this
paper, we propose a novel neural retriever architecture that tackles this
problem in a multilingual setting. Our method encodes project descriptions and
freelancer profiles by leveraging pre-trained multilingual language models. The
latter are used as backbone for a custom transformer architecture that aims to
keep the structure of the profiles and project. This model is trained with a
contrastive loss on historical data. Thanks to several experiments, we show
that this approach effectively captures skill matching similarity and
facilitates efficient matching, outperforming traditional methods.

| An Efficient Projection-Based Next-best-view Planning Framework for
  Reconstruction of Unknown Objects | Zhizhou Jia, Shaohui Zhang, Qun Hao |   Efficiently and completely capturing the three-dimensional data of an object
is a fundamental problem in industrial and robotic applications. The task of
next-best-view (NBV) planning is to infer the pose of the next viewpoint based
on the current data, and gradually realize the complete three-dimensional
reconstruction. Many existing algorithms, however, suffer a large computational
burden due to the use of ray-casting. To address this, this paper proposes a
projection-based NBV planning framework. It can select the next best view at an
extremely fast speed while ensuring the complete scanning of the object.
Specifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into
ellipsoids based on the voxel structure.Then, the next best view is selected
from the candidate views using a projection-based viewpoint quality evaluation
function in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy. This process
replaces the ray-casting in voxel structures, significantly improving the
computational efficiency. Comparative experiments with other algorithms in a
simulation environment show that the framework proposed in this paper can
achieve 10 times efficiency improvement on the basis of capturing roughly the
same coverage. The real-world experimental results also prove the efficiency
and feasibility of the framework.

| Undersampling effects on observed periods of coronal oscillations | Daye Lim, Tom Van Doorsselaere, Valery M. Nakariakov, Dmitrii Y. Kolotkov, Yuhang Gao, David Berghmans |   Context. Recent observations of decayless transverse oscillations have shown
two branches in the relationship between periods and loop lengths. One is a
linear relationship, interpreted as a standing mode. The other shows almost no
correlation and has not yet been interpreted conclusively. Aims. We
investigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless
oscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely
follow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations
are standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations
where the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase
are randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal
by considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of
telescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast
Fourier transform. Results. When the sampling cadence is getting closer to the
actual oscillation period, a tendency for overestimating periods in short loops
is enhanced. The relationship between loop lengths and periods of the sampled
signals shows the two branches as in the observation. Conclusions. We find that
long periods of decayless oscillations occurring in short loops could be the
result of undersampling.

| Enwrapped Perylene Bisimide Enables Room Temperature Polariton Lasing
  and Photonic Lattices | Dominik Horneber, Johannes Düreth, Tim Schembri, Simon Betzold, Matthias Stolte, Sven Höfling, Frank Würthner, Sebastian Klembt |   Perylene bisimides (PBIs) are organic dyes with photoluminescence quantum
yields (PLQY) close to unity in solution and great thermal and photo-chemical
stability. These features alongside the tunability of their solid-state packing
arrangement via chemical functionalization make this material class an
excellent candidate for exciton-polariton lasing at room temperature. Polariton
lasing is well understood in III-V semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures,
however, the search for emitter materials for robust and versatile room
temperature applications is ongoing. While e.g. perovskites and several organic
materials have been identified to support polariton lasing, many of these
materials lack tunability and long-term stability under ambient conditions.
Here, we fabricate optical microcavities using a strongly enwrapped PBI
chromophore with prevailing monomer-like absorption and emission properties in
the solid state. Voluminous bay-substituents prevent stacking induced
PLQY-quenching, thereby enabling polariton lasing at room temperature.
Additionally, photonic confinement in single hemispheric resonators is
demonstrated leading to localized polaritonic modes with discrete energies, as
well as optical lattices revealing distinct polaritonic band-structures. Due to
the possibility of tunable properties by the precise control of the solid-state
packing arrangement of PBI emitters, our results pave the way for
polarization-dependent light-matter coupling, including topological photonic
effects within oriented crystalline thin-film microcavity structures.

| IMRL: Integrating Visual, Physical, Temporal, and Geometric
  Representations for Enhanced Food Acquisition | Rui Liu, Zahiruddin Mahammad, Amisha Bhaskar, Pratap Tokekar |   Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality
of life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse
food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents
unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric
information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g.,
color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially
when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance.
We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition.
Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy
based on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, such
representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse
acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which
integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance
the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach
captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular,
liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and
introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and
assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies
based on context, improving the robot's capability to handle diverse food
acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach's
robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations,
including zero-shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves
improvement up to $35\%$ in success rate compared with the best-performing
baseline.

| Uncovering liquid-substrate fluctuation effects on crystal growth and
  disordered hyperuniformity of two-dimensional materials | S. K. Mkhonta, Zhi-Feng Huang, K. R. Elder |   We investigate the growth of two-dimensional (2D) crystals on fluctuating
surfaces using a phase field crystal model that is relevant on atomic length
and diffusive time scales. Motivated by recent experiments which achieved
unprecedented fast growth of large-size high-quality 2D crystals on liquid
substrates, we uncover novel effects of liquid surfaces on microstructural
ordering. We find that substrate fluctuations generate short-ranged noise that
speeds up crystallization and grain growth of the overlayer, surpassing that of
free-standing system. Coupling to the liquid substrate fluctuations can also
modulate local randomness, leading to intriguing disordered structures with
hidden spatial order, i.e., disordered hyperuniformity. These results reveal
the physical mechanisms underlying the fast growth of 2D crystals on liquid
surfaces and demonstrate a novel strategy for synthesizing disordered
hyperuniform thin film structures.

| The Impact of Element Ordering on LM Agent Performance | Wayne Chi, Ameet Talwalkar, Chris Donahue |   There has been a surge of interest in language model agents that can navigate
virtual environments such as the web or desktop. To navigate such environments,
agents benefit from information on the various elements (e.g., buttons, text,
or images) present. It remains unclear which element attributes have the
greatest impact on agent performance, especially in environments that only
provide a graphical representation (i.e., pixels). Here we find that the
ordering in which elements are presented to the language model is surprisingly
impactful--randomizing element ordering in a webpage degrades agent performance
comparably to removing all visible text from an agent's state representation.
While a webpage provides a hierarchical ordering of elements, there is no such
ordering when parsing elements directly from pixels. Moreover, as tasks become
more challenging and models more sophisticated, our experiments suggest that
the impact of ordering increases. Finding an effective ordering is non-trivial.
We investigate the impact of various element ordering methods in web and
desktop environments. We find that dimensionality reduction provides a viable
ordering for pixel-only environments. We train a UI element detection model to
derive elements from pixels and apply our findings to an agent
benchmark--OmniACT--where we only have access to pixels. Our method completes
more than two times as many tasks on average relative to the previous
state-of-the-art.

| Quark saturation in the QCD phase diagram | Marcus Bluhm, Yuki Fujimoto, Larry McLerran, Marlene Nahrgang |   We determine the onset of Quarkyonic Matter corresponding to values of
temperature and baryon chemical potential at which the quark phase space
density becomes one. At zero temperature for baryon chemical potentials below
the mass of the Lambda baryon, only nucleons contribute to the quark density.
This is different at finite temperature, where all baryons, mesons and their
resonances can be excited and thus add quarks to the phase space. The
probability density to find a quark inside a hadron is determined using the
Yukawa ansatz of the IdylliQ model of Quarkyonic Matter. We estimate separately
the magnitude of the various contributions of nucleons, Delta baryons, pions as
well as further hadrons and resonances. The uncertainty in the parametrization
of the probability density to find a quark inside a nucleon is spanned by
assuming that at zero temperature the transition density to Quarkyonic Matter
is between one and three times that of nuclear matter. Various predictions for
a possible critical point associated with the chiral phase transition are found
close to a triple point at which the line of the deconfinement transition and
the curve associated with the transition to Quarkyonic Matter intersect. These
considerations provide an estimate for the region in the QCD phase diagram
where Quarkyonic Matter may be found.

  The global existence of weak solutions or classical solutions to the above

| ReLU Surrogates in Mixed-Integer MPC for Irrigation Scheduling | Bernard T. Agyeman, Jinfeng Liu, Sirish L. Shah |   Efficient water management in agriculture is important for mitigating the
growing freshwater scarcity crisis. Mixed-integer Model Predictive Control
(MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex
scheduling problems in agricultural irrigation. However, the computational
complexity of mixed-integer MPC still poses a significant challenge,
particularly in large-scale applications. This study proposes an approach to
enhance the computational efficiency of mixed-integer MPC-based irrigation
schedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture
dynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed-integer linear
representation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the
mixed-integer MPC-based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a
mixed-integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed-integer
nonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global
optimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated
through comparative studies conducted on a large-scale agricultural field
across two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models,
specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used
triggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU-based approach significantly
reduces solution times -- by up to 99.5\% -- while achieving comparable
performance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water
Use Efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, the ReLU-based approach maintains enhanced
performance in terms of total prescribed irrigation and IWUE compared to the
widely-used triggered irrigation scheduling method.

| Design of Ligand-Binding Proteins with Atomic Flow Matching | Junqi Liu, Shaoning Li, Chence Shi, Zhi Yang, Jian Tang |   Designing novel proteins that bind to small molecules is a long-standing
challenge in computational biology, with applications in developing catalysts,
biosensors, and more. Current computational methods rely on the assumption that
the binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible,
as conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon
binding. In this work, we formulate proteins and molecules as unified
biotokens, and present AtomFlow, a novel deep generative model under the
flow-matching framework for the design of ligand-binding proteins from the 2D
target molecular graph alone. Operating on representative atoms of biotokens,
AtomFlow captures the flexibility of ligands and generates ligand conformations
and protein backbone structures iteratively. We consider the multi-scale nature
of biotokens and demonstrate that AtomFlow can be effectively trained on a
subset of structures from the Protein Data Bank, by matching flow vector field
using an SE(3) equivariant structure prediction network. Experimental results
show that our method can generate high fidelity ligand-binding proteins and
achieve performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model RFDiffusionAA,
while not requiring bound ligand structures. As a general framework, AtomFlow
holds the potential to be applied to various biomolecule generation tasks in
the future.

| Denoising diffusion models for high-resolution microscopy image
  restoration | Pamela Osuna-Vargas, Maren H. Wehrheim, Lucas Zinz, Johanna Rahm, Ashwin Balakrishnan, Alexandra Kaminer, Mike Heilemann, Matthias Kaschube |   Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at
the nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological
organization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of
fluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses
remain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced
laser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and
increased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high-resolution
images by conditioning the model on low-resolution information. Additionally,
the probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images
that tend to further increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We show that our model
achieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously
best-performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly,
while any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but
not all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all
four data sets, suggesting high generalizability.

| Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Via Data Pruning | Andrea Napoli, Paul White |   The removal of carefully-selected examples from training data has recently
emerged as an effective way of improving the robustness of machine learning
models. However, the best way to select these examples remains an open
question. In this paper, we consider the problem from the perspective of
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). We propose AdaPrune, a method for UDA
whereby training examples are removed to attempt to align the training
distribution to that of the target data. By adopting the maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) as the criterion for alignment, the problem can be neatly
formulated and solved as an integer quadratic program. We evaluate our approach
on a real-world domain shift task of bioacoustic event detection. As a method
for UDA, we show that AdaPrune outperforms related techniques, and is
complementary to other UDA algorithms such as CORAL. Our analysis of the
relationship between the MMD and model accuracy, along with t-SNE plots,
validate the proposed method as a principled and well-founded way of performing
data pruning.

| The elastica sling | Alessandro Cazzolli, Francesco Dal Corso |   The nonlinear mechanics of a flexible elastic rod constrained at its edges by
a pair of sliding sleeves is analyzed. The planar equilibrium configurations of
this variable-length elastica are found to have shape defined only by the
inclination of the two constraints, while their distance is responsible only
for scaling the size. By extending the theoretical stability criterion
available for systems under isoperimetric constraints to the case of variable
domains, the existence of no more than one stable equilibrium solution is
revealed. The set of sliding sleeves' inclination pairs for which the stability
is lost are identified. Such critical conditions allow the indefinite ejection
of the flexible rod from the sliding sleeves, thus realizing an elastica sling.
Finally, the theoretical findings are validated by experiments on a physical
prototype. The present results lead to a novel actuation principle that may
find application as a mechanism in energy harvesting, wave mitigation devices,
and soft robotic locomotion.

| Online Refractive Camera Model Calibration in Visual Inertial Odometry | Mohit Singh, Kostas Alexis |   This paper presents a general refractive camera model and online
co-estimation of odometry and the refractive index of unknown media. This
enables operation in diverse and varying refractive fluids, given only the
camera calibration in air. The refractive index is estimated online as a state
variable of a monocular visual-inertial odometry framework in an iterative
formulation using the proposed camera model. The method was verified on data
collected using an underwater robot traversing inside a pool. The evaluations
demonstrate convergence to the ideal refractive index for water despite
significant perturbations in the initialization. Simultaneously, the approach
enables on-par visual-inertial odometry performance in refractive media without
prior knowledge of the refractive index or requirement of medium-specific
camera calibration.

| Influence of dislocations in multilayer graphene stacks: A phase field
  crystal study | K. R. Elder, Zhi-Feng Huang, T. Ala-Nissila |   In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene
stacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a
recently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems
incorporating out-of-plane deformations and parameterized to match to density
functional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems. The
specific configuration considered consists of one monolayer containing four
$5|7$ dislocations (i.e., two dislocation dipoles) sandwiched in between
perfect graphene layers. The study reveals how the strain field from the
dislocations in the defected layer leads to out-of-plane deformations that in
turn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are
made for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a
defect-free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and
system size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by
roughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence
across the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height
profiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.

| PAD-FT: A Lightweight Defense for Backdoor Attacks via Data Purification
  and Fine-Tuning | Yukai Xu, Yujie Gu, Kouichi Sakurai |   Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks,
particularly as recent advancements have led to increasingly subtle
implantation, making the defense more challenging. Existing defense mechanisms
typically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and
involve retraining an auxiliary model or fine-tuning the entire victim model.
However, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always
feasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and
lightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD-FT, that does not require an
additional clean dataset and fine-tunes only a very small part of the model to
disinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a
simple data purification process to identify and select the most-likely clean
data from the poisoned training dataset. The self-purified clean dataset is
then used for activation clipping and fine-tuning only the last classification
layer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation
clipping, and classifier fine-tuning, our mechanism PAD-FT demonstrates
superior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as
confirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.

| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing
  data in Irish sagas | P. MacCarron |   For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts
in order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify
similarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the
significance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture
requires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and
often impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the
network of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that
the top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent
with central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has
been lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust
to a large random removal of edges.

| The repetition threshold for ternary rich words | James D. Currie, Lucas Mol, Jarkko Peltomäki |   In 2014, Vesti proposed the problem of determining the repetition threshold
for infinite rich words, i.e., for infinite words in which all factors of
length $n$ contain $n$ distinct nonempty palindromic factors. In 2020, Currie,
Mol, and Rampersad proved a conjecture of Baranwal and Shallit that the
repetition threshold for binary rich words is $2 + \sqrt{2}/2$. In this paper,
we prove a structure theorem for $16/7$-power-free ternary rich words. Using
the structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich
words is $1 + 1/(3 - \mu) \approx 2.25876324$, where $\mu$ is the unique real
root of the polynomial $x^3 - 2x^2 - 1$.

| Fitting Multilevel Factor Models | Tetiana Parshakova, Trevor Hastie, Stephen Boyd |   We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance
given by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~\cite{parshakova2023factor}. We
develop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of
the observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and
maintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved
through a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive
definite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of an invertible PSD MLR matrix
is also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the
recursive Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of
the inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky
factorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities,
yielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement. This paper is
accompanied by an open-source package that implements the proposed methods.

| Drifts of the sub-stellar points of the TRAPPIST-1 planets | Revol Alexandre, Émeline Bolmont, Mariana Sastre, Gabriel Tobie, Anne-Sophie Libert, Mathilde Kervazo, Sergi Blanco-Cuaresma |   Accurate modeling of tidal interactions is crucial for interpreting recent
JWST observations of the thermal emissions of TRAPPIST-1~b and c and for
characterizing the surface conditions and potential habitability of the other
planets in the system. Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by
tidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to
their proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the
TRAPPIST-1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In
this work, we present the recent implementation of the co-planar tidal torque
and forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N-body code
Posidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using
a tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of
each planet by taking into account their multi-layer internal structure
computed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets
are not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state.
Planet-planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and
tides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a
result, the sub-stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and
long-timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with
periods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.

| Quantum Magic and Multi-Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei | Florian Brökemeier, S. Momme Hengstenberg, James W. T. Keeble, Caroline E. P. Robin, Federico Rocco, Martin J. Savage |   Motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the
quantum complexity of $p$-shell and $sd$-shell nuclei. Valence-space nuclear
shell-model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit
registers using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$-shell and 24
qubits for the $sd$-shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement
($n$-tangles) and magic (non-stabilizerness) are determined. While exact
evaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of
active nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex
nuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique
is introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed
nuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\sim 8$ for some
nuclei. Significant multi-nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$-shell,
dominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of
magic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on
the path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion.
These results indicate that quantum-computing resources will accelerate
precision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.

| Post-Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a
  massive, rotating object | Lorenzo Iorio |   The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the
general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring
components of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are
analytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level. To the Newtonian
order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as
well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation
in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the
primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first
to 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system
along an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred
close to the Sun's flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due
to the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of
microarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for
the post-Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)
spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of
the latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current
(formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would
bring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the
predicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not
changed by any of the post--Keplerian accelerations considered. The
calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any
alternative models of gravity as well.

| Generalized Robot Learning Framework | Jiahuan Yan, Zhouyang Hong, Yu Zhao, Yu Tian, Yunxin Liu, Travis Davies, Luhui Hu |   Imitation based robot learning has recently gained significant attention in
the robotics field due to its theoretical potential for transferability and
generalizability. However, it remains notoriously costly, both in terms of
hardware and data collection, and deploying it in real-world environments
demands meticulous setup of robots and precise experimental conditions. In this
paper, we present a low-cost robot learning framework that is both easily
reproducible and transferable to various robots and environments. We
demonstrate that deployable imitation learning can be successfully applied even
to industrial-grade robots, not just expensive collaborative robotic arms.
Furthermore, our results show that multi-task robot learning is achievable with
simple network architectures and fewer demonstrations than previously thought
necessary. As the current evaluating method is almost subjective when it comes
to real-world manipulation tasks, we propose Voting Positive Rate (VPR) - a
novel evaluation strategy that provides a more objective assessment of
performance. We conduct an extensive comparison of success rates across various
self-designed tasks to validate our approach. To foster collaboration and
support the robot learning community, we have open-sourced all relevant
datasets and model checkpoints, available at huggingface.co/ZhiChengAI.

| PARAPHRASUS : A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Paraphrase
  Detection Models | Andrianos Michail, Simon Clematide, Juri Opitz |   The task of determining whether two texts are paraphrases has long been a
challenge in NLP. However, the prevailing notion of paraphrase is often quite
simplistic, offering only a limited view of the vast spectrum of paraphrase
phenomena. Indeed, we find that evaluating models in a paraphrase dataset can
leave uncertainty about their true semantic understanding. To alleviate this,
we release paraphrasus, a benchmark designed for multi-dimensional assessment
of paraphrase detection models and finer model selection. We find that
paraphrase detection models under a fine-grained evaluation lens exhibit
trade-offs that cannot be captured through a single classification dataset.

| Dual-Layer Training and Decoding of Large Language Model with
  Simultaneously Thinking and Speaking | Ningyuan Xi, Xiaoyu Wang, Yetao Wu, Teng Chen, Qingqing Gu, Jinxian Qu, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong Chen, Luo Ji |   Large Language Model can reasonably understand and generate human expressions
but may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have
been several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but
most of them are not data-driven or training-based. In this paper, we are
motivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel
model architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts
and then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines
to annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt-response samples, then
add language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We
train the language model by the thoughts-augmented data and successfully let
the thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally
output more reasonable responses. Both qualitative examples and quantitative
results validate the effectiveness and performance of TaS. Our code is
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TadE.

| Artemis: Efficient Commit-and-Prove SNARKs for zkML | Hidde Lycklama, Alexander Viand, Nikolay Avramov, Nicolas Küchler, Anwar Hithnawi |   The widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) in various critical
applications, from healthcare to autonomous systems, has raised significant
concerns about privacy, accountability, and trustworthiness. To address these
concerns, recent research has focused on developing zero-knowledge machine
learning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of
ML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have
substantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily
optimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the
substantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the
model and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new
Commit-and-Prove SNARK (CP-SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that
effectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML
pipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white-box use of the
underlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic
polynomial commitment and only makes black-box use of the proof system. As a
result, Artemis is compatible with state-of-the-art proof systems without
trusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP-SNARKs, evaluate
their performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial
improvements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover
costs and maintaining efficiency even for large-scale models. For example, for
the VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from
11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML
towards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and
complex ML models.

| MMP for Enriques pairs and singular Enriques varieties | Francesco Antonio Denisi, Ángel David Ríos Ortiz, Nikolaos Tsakanikas, Zhixin Xie |   We introduce and study the class of primitive Enriques varieties, whose
smooth members are Enriques manifolds. We provide several examples and we
demonstrate that this class is stable under the operations of the Minimal Model
Program (MMP). In particular, given an Enriques manifold $Y$ and an effective
$\mathbb{R}$-divisor $B_Y$ on $Y$ such that the pair $(Y,B_Y)$ is log
canonical, we prove that any $(K_Y+B_Y)$-MMP terminates with a minimal model
$(Y',B_{Y'})$ of $(Y,B_Y)$, where $Y'$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial primitive
Enriques variety with canonical singularities. Finally, we investigate the
asymptotic theory of Enriques manifolds.

| Numerical renormalization group calculations for magnetic impurity
  systems with spin-orbit coupling and crystal-field effects | Aitor Calvo-Fernández, María Blanco-Rey, Asier Eiguren |   Exploiting symmetries in the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method
significantly enhances performance by improving accuracy, increasing
computational speed, and optimizing memory efficiency. Published codes focus on
continuous rotations and unitary groups, which generally are not applicable to
systems with strong crystal-field effects. The PointGroupNRG code implements
symmetries related to discrete rotation groups, which are defined by the user
in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, together with particle conservation
and spin rotation symmetries. In this paper we present a new version of the
code that extends the available finite groups, previously limited to simply
reducible point groups, in a way that all point and double groups become
accessible. It also includes the full spin-orbital rotation group. Moreover, to
improve the code's flexibility for impurities with complex interactions, this
new version allows to choose between a standard Anderson Hamiltonian for the
impurity or, as another novel feature, an ionic model that requires only the
spectrum and the impurity Lehmann amplitudes.

| Quantum-like nonlinear interferometry with frequency-engineered
  classical light | Romain Dalidet, Anthony Martin, Grégory Sauder, Laurent Labonté, Sébastien Tanzilli |   Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic
entanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits. Nonlinear
optics has served as a workhorse for the generation of entangled photon pairs,
ensuring both energy and phase conservation, but at the cost of limited rate
and degraded signal-to-noise ratio compared to laser-based interferometry
approaches. We present a \"quantum-like\" nonlinear optical method that reaches
super-resolution in single-photon detection regime. This is achieved by
replacing photon-pairs by coherent states of light, mimicking quantum
properties through classical nonlinear optics processes. Our scheme utilizes
two high-brightness lasers. This results in a substantially greater
signal-to-noise ratio compared to its quantum counterpart. Such an approach
paves the way to significantly reduced acquisition times, providing a pathway
to explore signals across a broader range of bandwidth. The need to increase
the frequency bandwidth of the quantum sensor significantly motivates the
potential applications of this pathway.

  Among Cybersecurity Professionals | Sunil Arora, John D. Hastings |   This study investigates the prevalence and underlying causes of work-related
stress and burnout among cybersecurity professionals using a quantitative
survey approach guided by the Job Demands-Resources model. Analysis of
responses from 50 cybersecurity practitioners reveals an alarming reality: 44%
report experiencing severe work-related stress and burnout, while an additional
28% are uncertain about their condition. The demanding nature of cybersecurity
roles, unrealistic expectations, and unsupportive organizational cultures
emerge as primary factors fueling this crisis. Notably, 66% of respondents
perceive cybersecurity jobs as more stressful than other IT positions, with 84%
facing additional challenges due to the pandemic and recent high-profile
breaches. The study finds that most cybersecurity experts are reluctant to
report their struggles to management, perpetuating a cycle of silence and
neglect. To address this critical issue, the paper recommends that
organizations foster supportive work environments, implement mindfulness
programs, and address systemic challenges. By prioritizing the mental health of
cybersecurity professionals, organizations can cultivate a more resilient and
effective workforce to protect against an ever-evolving threat landscape.

| Handling Long-Term Safety and Uncertainty in Safe Reinforcement Learning | Jonas Günster, Puze Liu, Jan Peters, Davide Tateo |   Safety is one of the key issues preventing the deployment of reinforcement
learning techniques in real-world robots. While most approaches in the Safe
Reinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and
robot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them
in complex real-world settings. Instead, model-based approaches that
incorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning
framework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on
the real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot
dynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task-specific and hard
to obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to
compute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long-term safety
requirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe
exploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus
on ensuring long-term safety and handling of uncertainty. Our approach is
competitive or superior to state-of-the-art methods in final performance while
maintaining safer behavior during training.

| Quasiperiodic Floquet-Gibbs states in Rydberg atomic systems | Wilson S. Martins, Federico Carollo, Kay Brandner, Igor Lesanovsky |   Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by
fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an
equilibrium-like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet-Magnus
Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi's golden rule, we show
that such Floquet-Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated
Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab-frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function
of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the
system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which
is necessary to uphold high-lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To
corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five
interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate
numerically that the second-order Floquet-Gibbs state of this system is
essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding
Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently
large.

| Understanding the Effects of the Baidu-ULTR Logging Policy on Two-Tower
  Models | Morris de Haan, Philipp Hager |   Despite the popularity of the two-tower model for unbiased learning to rank
(ULTR) tasks, recent work suggests that it suffers from a major limitation that
could lead to its collapse in industry applications: the problem of logging
policy confounding. Several potential solutions have even been proposed;
however, the evaluation of these methods was mostly conducted using
semi-synthetic simulation experiments. This paper bridges the gap between
theory and practice by investigating the confounding problem on the largest
real-world dataset, Baidu-ULTR. Our main contributions are threefold: 1) we
show that the conditions for the confounding problem are given on Baidu-ULTR,
2) the confounding problem bears no significant effect on the two-tower model,
and 3) we point to a potential mismatch between expert annotations, the golden
standard in ULTR, and user click behavior.

| DynaMo: In-Domain Dynamics Pretraining for Visuo-Motor Control | Zichen Jeff Cui, Hengkai Pan, Aadhithya Iyer, Siddhant Haldar, Lerrel Pinto |   Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex
visuomotor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to
thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual
observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual
representations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or
trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present
DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual
representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a
latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of
image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without
augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.
Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet
datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real
environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly
improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised
learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo
hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,
and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and
measure its impact on downstream policy performance. Robot videos are best

with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary

capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL
investigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By
scaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the
amount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive
performance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to
leading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal

| Bundle Adjustment in the Eager Mode | Zitong Zhan, Huan Xu, Zihang Fang, Xinpeng Wei, Yaoyu Hu, Chen Wang |   Bundle adjustment (BA) is a critical technique in various robotic
applications, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), augmented
reality (AR), and photogrammetry. BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses
and 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance
of deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to
integrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and
performance. However, widely-used C++-based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,
g$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries
like PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of
debugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we
introduce an eager-mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,
providing PyTorch-compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach
includes GPU-accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for
2nd-order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear
solvers. Our eager-mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency,
achieving an average speedup of 18.5$\times$, 22$\times$, and 23$\times$
compared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.

| Massively Multi-Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context | Felix B Mueller, Julian Tanke, Juergen Gall |   Forecasting long-term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of
human behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input
sequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby
people can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene-aware social
transformer model (SAST) to forecast long-term (10s) human motion motion.
Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely
varying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal
convolutional encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer-based bottleneck
that allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model
the conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We
benchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to
16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously. Our model
outperforms other approaches in terms of realism and diversity on different
metrics and in a user study. Code is available at

| SPECTER: An Instrument Concept for CMB Spectral Distortion Measurements
  with Enhanced Sensitivity | Alina Sabyr, Carlos Sierra, J. Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon |   Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a
perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from
fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\mu$-distortion) to late-time
baryonic feedback processes (y-distortion). While the y-distortion can be
detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude
smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a
serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\mu$
arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the
primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here,
we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly
detecting $\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but
with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we
optimize the instrument's configuration to target $\mu$ while robustly
marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike
Fourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their
individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing
significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion at $\approx 5\sigma$ (10$\sigma$)
assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission
duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized
configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular
resolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally
measure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic
correction at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total
thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.

  Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary-mass
  object 2MASS J11151597+1937266 | Gayathri Viswanath, Simon C. Ringqvist, Dorian Demars, Markus Janson, Mickaël Bonnefoy, Yuhiko Aoyama, Gabriel-Dominique Marleau, Catherine Dougados, Judit Szulágyi, Thanawuth Thanathibodee |   Accretion among planets is a poorly understood phenomenon, due to lack of
both observational and theoretical studies. Detection of emission lines from
accreting gas giants facilitate detailed investigations into this process. This
work presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known
young, planetary-mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf
2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7-21 Mj and age 5-45 Myr, located at 45+-2
pc. We obtained the first high-resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target
with VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near-UV to visible wavelengths (3200-6800
AA). We report resolved H3-H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.
Based on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+-1
km/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR
excess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of
the parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+-63 K and radius to 1.5+-0.1
Rj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet-surface shock model
implies a pre-shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,-40) km/s and a pre-shock
density of log(n0/cm^-3)=14(+0,-5). Pre-shock velocity points to a mass of
6(+8,-4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary
Lline-Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of
1.4(+2.8,-0.9)x10^-8 Mj/yr.

from its predecessor, CodeQwen1.5. This series includes two models:
Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B. As a code-specific model,
Qwen2.5-Coder is built upon the Qwen2.5 architecture and continues pretrained
on a vast corpus of over 5.5 trillion tokens. Through meticulous data cleaning,
scalable synthetic data generation, and balanced data mixing, Qwen2.5-Coder
demonstrates impressive code generation capabilities while retaining general
versatility. The model has been evaluated on a wide range of code-related
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across more than 10
benchmarks, including code generation, completion, reasoning, and repair,
consistently outperforming larger models of the same model size. We believe
that the release of the Qwen2.5-Coder series will not only push the boundaries
of research in code intelligence but also, through its permissive licensing,
encourage broader adoption by developers in real-world applications.

| Disruption of a massive molecular cloud by a supernova in the Galactic
  Centre: Initial results from the ACES project | M. Nonhebel, A. T. Barnes, K. Immer, J. Armijos-Abendaño, J. Bally, C. Battersby, M. G. Burton, N. Butterfield, L. Colzi, P. García, A. Ginsburg, J.

Santa-Maria, H. A. Smith, Y. Sofue, M. C. Sormani, V. Tolls, D. L. Walker, Q. D. Wang, G. M. Williams, F. -W. Xu |   The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our
local solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions
it exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong
dynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).
Consequently, it is likely that there are large-scale physical structures
within the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we
present new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a
multi-wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the
M0.8$-$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring-like morphology. We
estimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring to be 79\"
and 154\", respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre
distance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $> 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, a
mass of $\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\odot$, and an expansion speed of $\sim$ 20 km
s$^{-1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($> 10^{51}$ erg) and
momentum ($> 10^7$ M$_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$). We discuss several possible causes
for the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback
and large-scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the
M0.8$-$0.2 ring is a single high-energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain
the observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have
taken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which
we now see as the M0.8$-$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an
extreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.

| To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic
  reasoning | Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett |   Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of
tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted
a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own
evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives
strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with
much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the
answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the
question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic
operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of
CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing
against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic
execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our
results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance
while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond
prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation
across the whole range of LLM applications.

| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs | Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T. Chiu, Siyu Ren, Fei Yuan, Wenting Zhao, Zhiyong Wu, Alexander M. Rush |   Broad textual understanding and in-context learning require language models
that utilize full document contexts. Due to the implementation challenges
associated with directly training long-context models, many methods have been
proposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to
differences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these
approaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long-context
performance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a
controlled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation,
utilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several
insights into long-context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of
perplexity as a general-purpose performance indicator even in longer-context
tasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods
systematically underperform across long-context tasks. Finally, we confirm that
exact fine-tuning based methods are generally effective within the range of
their extension, whereas extrapolation remains challenging. All codebases,
models, and checkpoints will be made available open-source, promoting
transparency and facilitating further research in this critical area of AI
development.

| Finetuning Language Models to Emit Linguistic Expressions of Uncertainty | Arslan Chaudhry, Sridhar Thiagarajan, Dilan Gorur |   Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in information-seeking
and decision-making tasks. Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate
information that conflicts with real-world facts, and their persuasive style
can make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result,
end-users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with
the accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all
outputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore
supervised finetuning on uncertainty-augmented predictions as a method to
develop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty.
Specifically, we measure the calibration of pre-trained models and then
fine-tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of
uncertainty. Through experiments on various question-answering datasets, we
demonstrate that LLMs are well-calibrated in assessing their predictions, and
supervised finetuning based on the model's own confidence leads to
well-calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single-claim
answers.

| Computational Dynamical Systems | Jordan Cotler, Semon Rezchikov |   We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite-dimensional
dynamical systems. Building off of previous work, we give definitions for what
it means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine. We then
show that 'chaotic' dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and
'integrable' dynamical systems (more generally, measure-preserving systems)
cannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines can
be robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, we
show that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable
one-dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and
moreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt.
More broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one 'machine' to simulate
another, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low-complexity 'encoders' and
'decoders' to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system
being simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical
system leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity
theory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.

| Poisson approximate likelihood compared to the particle filter | Yize Hao, Aaron A. Abkemeier, Edward L. Ionides |   Filtering algorithms are fundamental for inference on partially observed
stochastic dynamic systems, since they provide access to the likelihood
function and hence enable likelihood-based or Bayesian inference. A novel
Poisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.
(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering
a fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of
partially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL
is the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large
improvement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,
based on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.
(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should
use PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence
also reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a
shortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that
the comparison of log-likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al. (2023) is
flawed because their PAL calculations were carried out using a dataset scaled
differently from the previous study. If PAL and the particle filter are applied
to the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears. On simulations
where the model is correctly specified, the particle filter outperforms PAL.

| You Only Read Once (YORO): Learning to Internalize Database Knowledge
  for Text-to-SQL | Hideo Kobayashi, Wuwei Lan, Peng Shi, Shuaichen Chang, Jiang Guo, Henghui Zhu, Zhiguo Wang, Patrick Ng |   While significant progress has been made on the text-to-SQL task, recent
solutions repeatedly encode the same database schema for every question,
resulting in unnecessary high inference cost and often overlooking crucial
database knowledge. To address these issues, we propose You Only Read Once
(YORO), a novel paradigm that directly internalizes database knowledge into the
parametric knowledge of a text-to-SQL model during training and eliminates the
need for schema encoding during inference. YORO significantly reduces the input
token length by 66%-98%. Despite its shorter inputs, our empirical results
demonstrate YORO's competitive performances with traditional systems on three
benchmarks as well as its significant outperformance on large databases.
Furthermore, YORO excels in handling questions with challenging value

$f(x)=a(x-1/2)$ with $a\neq 0$ are ergodic for every ergodic symmetric IET in
the base, thus giving the full characterization of ergodic extensions in this
family. Moreover, we prove that under an additional natural assumption of
unique ergodicity on the IET, we can replace $f$ with any differentiable
function with a non-zero sum of jumps. Finally, by considering weakly mixing
IETs instead of just ergodic, we show that the skew products with cocycle given

| multiPI-TransBTS: A Multi-Path Learning Framework for Brain Tumor Image
  Segmentation Based on Multi-Physical Information | Hongjun Zhu, Jiaohang Huang, Kuo Chen, Xuehui Ying, Ying Qian |   Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis,
treatment planning, and monitoring the progression of brain tumors. However,
due to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across
different MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In
this study, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework, multiPI-TransBTS,
which integrates multi-physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.
The model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi-modal
imaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor
characteristics. The multiPI-TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an
Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi-source, multi-scale feature
decoder. The encoder incorporates a multi-branch architecture to separately
extract modality-specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module
fuses information from multiple sources using channel-wise and element-wise
attention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both
common and task-specific features through a Task-Specific Feature Introduction
(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),
Tumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on
the BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of
multiPI-TransBTS over the state-of-the-art methods. The model consistently
achieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,
highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results
also indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision
and recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a
significant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving
clinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.

| Synchrotron self-Compton in a radiative-adiabatic fireball scenario:
  Modelling the multiwavelength observations in some Fermi/LAT bursts | Nissim Fraija, P. Veres, B. Betancourt Kamenetskaia, A. Galvan-Gamez, M. G. Dainotti, Simone Dichiara, R. L. Becerra |   Energetic GeV photons expected from the closest and the most energetic
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provide an unique opportunity to study the
very-high-energy emission as well as the possible correlations with lower
energy bands in realistic GRB afterglow models. In the standard GRB afterglow
model, the relativistic homogeneous shock is usually considered to be fully
adiabatic, however, it could be partially radiative. Based on the external
forward-shock scenario in both stellar wind and constant-density medium. We
present a radiative-adiabatic analytical model of the synchrotron self-Compton
(SSC) and synchrotron processes considering an electron energy distribution
with a power-law index of 1 < p < 2 and 2 $\leq$ p. We show that the SSC
scenario plays a relevant role in the radiative parameter $\epsilon$, leading
to a prolonged evolution during the slow cooling regime. In a particular case,
we derive the Fermi/LAT light curves together with the photons with energies
$\geq$ 100 MeV in a sample of nine bursts from the second Fermi/LAT GRB catalog
that exhibited temporal and spectral indices with $\geq$ 1.5 and $\approx$ 2,
respectively. These events can hardly be described with closure relations of
the standard synchrotron afterglow model, and also exhibit energetic photons
above the synchrotron limit. We have modeled the multi-wavelength observations
of our sample to constrain the microphysical parameters, the circumburst
density, the bulk Lorentz factor and the mechanism responsible for explaining
the energetic GeV photons.

| Blind Deconvolution on Graphs: Exact and Stable Recovery | Chang Ye, Gonzalo Mateos |   We study a blind deconvolution problem on graphs, which arises in the context
of localizing a few sources that diffuse over networks. While the observations
are bilinear functions of the unknown graph filter coefficients and sparse
input signals, a mild requirement on invertibility of the diffusion filter
enables an efficient convex relaxation leading to a linear programming
formulation that can be tackled with off-the-shelf solvers. Under the
Bernoulli-Gaussian model for the inputs, we derive sufficient exact recovery
conditions in the noise-free setting. A stable recovery result is then
established, ensuring the estimation error remains manageable even when the
observations are corrupted by a small amount of noise. Numerical tests with
synthetic and real-world network data illustrate the merits of the proposed
algorithm, its robustness to noise as well as the benefits of leveraging
multiple signals to aid the (blind) localization of sources of diffusion. At a
fundamental level, the results presented here broaden the scope of classical
blind deconvolution of (spatio-)temporal signals to irregular graph domains.

| Generalized compression and compressive search of large datasets | Morgan E. Prior, Thomas Howard III, Emily Light, Najib Ishaq, Noah M. Daniels |   The Big Data explosion has necessitated the development of search algorithms
that scale sub-linearly in time and memory.
  While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently,
few algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain-specific.
  We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to
perform $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search on compressed data while only decompressing
a small, relevant, portion of the data.
  panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low-dimensional
structure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.
  panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between
two points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in
terms of the other.
  This property holds for many widely-used distance functions, e.g. string edit
distances (Levenshtein, Needleman-Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures
(Jaccard, Dice, etc.).
  We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic,
and set data.
  We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the
compressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.
  panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering
sub-linear time performance for $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search.
  We conclude that panCAKES is an efficient, general-purpose algorithm for
exact compressive search on large datasets that obey the manifold hypothesis.
  We provide an open-source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming
language.

| WeHelp: A Shared Autonomy System for Wheelchair Users | Abulikemu Abuduweili, Alice Wu, Tianhao Wei, Weiye Zhao |   There is a large population of wheelchair users. Most of the wheelchair users
need help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs
are not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this
project, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair
users. A robot with a WeHelp system has three modes, following mode, remote
control mode and tele-operation mode. In the following mode, the robot follows
the wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can
ask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the
wheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech
recognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode.
In the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy
stick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs,
such as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high
shelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant
takes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks
for their needs. Our evaluation shows that the pipeline is useful and practical

| Identifying inflated Fermi surfaces via thermoelectric response in
  $d$-wave superconductor heterostructure | Amartya Pal, Paramita Dutta, Arijit Saha |   We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric response of inflated Fermi
surfaces (IFSs) generated in a two dimensional unconventional $d$-wave
superconductor subjected to an external in-plane Zeeman field. These IFSs
exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are
topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the
Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave
superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients
including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and
examine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage
and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of
$d$-wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the
normal-superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric
response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in
Seebeck coefficient ($\sim 200\,\mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($\sim 3.5$) due to the
generation of the IFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for
device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by
computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice-regularized
version of our continuum model.

| JEAN: Joint Expression and Audio-guided NeRF-based Talking Face
  Generation | Sai Tanmay Reddy Chakkera, Aggelina Chatziagapi, Dimitris Samaras |   We introduce a novel method for joint expression and audio-guided talking
face generation. Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker
identity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these
challenges, we propose a NeRF-based network. Since we train our network on
monocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn
disentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio
features in a self-supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects.
By incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned
audio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle
motion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer-based architecture
that learns expression features, capturing long-range facial expressions and
disentangling them from the speech-specific mouth movements. Through
quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-fidelity talking face videos, achieving state-of-the-art facial
expression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.

  for lesion segmentation in PET/CT | Hamza Kalisch, Fabian Hörst, Ken Herrmann, Jens Kleesiek, Constantin Seibold |   Lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging is essential for precise tumor
characterization, which supports personalized treatment planning and enhances
diagnostic precision in oncology. However, accurate manual segmentation of
lesions is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. Given the
rising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods,
particularly deep-learning-based approaches, have become increasingly more
relevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation
of tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting,
addressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable
solutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET
challenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers
(FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers. To this extent, we developed a

| Robots that Learn to Safely Influence via Prediction-Informed
  Reach-Avoid Dynamic Games | Ravi Pandya, Changliu Liu, Andrea Bajcsy |   Robots can influence people to accomplish their tasks more efficiently:
autonomous cars can inch forward at an intersection to pass through, and
tabletop manipulators can go for an object on the table first. However, a
robot's ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if
naively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach-avoid
dynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a
safety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human's behavior
as goal-driven but conditioned on the robot's plan, enabling us to capture
influence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical
and belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in
human behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE
(Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high-dimensional
(39-D) simulated human-robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline
game-theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust
baseline that treats the human as a worst-case adversary, a safety controller
that does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy-function-based
safety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage
the influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing
the robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate
during task execution.

| Decoding Style: Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Image-Guided Outfit
  Recommendation with Preference | Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan |   Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding
both fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper
presents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large
language models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their \"black box\" and static
nature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item
visual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style
and color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis
for personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the
open-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability
to recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative
examples is employed to enhance the LLM's decision-making process. This creates
a self-enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in
line with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore
dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill-in-the-blank,
and complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework's
ability to generate stylish, trend-aligned outfit suggestions, continuously
improving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our
proposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more
cohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the
proposed framework's potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate
suggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit
generation.

| Mechanical Wannier-Stark Ladder of Diamond Spin-Mechanical Lamb Wave
  Resonators | Philip Andrango, Hailin Wang |   We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier-Stark ladders of
diamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with
ultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin
properties. Three nearest-neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric
configurations and a large range of coupling rates have been explored for the
realization of Wannier-Stark ladders of LWRs, potentially enabling long-range
connectivity between spin qubits through their interactions with mechanical
vibrations. Additional analysis on the effects of disorder indicates that the
proposed Wannier-Stark ladder can be robust against realistic experimental
imperfections. The development of mechanical quantum networks of spin qubits
with long-range connectivity can open the door to the implementation of newly
developed quantum low-density parity-check codes in solid-state systems.

| MAgICoRe: Multi-Agent, Iterative, Coarse-to-Fine Refinement for
  Reasoning | Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Archiki Prasad, Swarnadeep Saha, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal |   Large Language Models' (LLM) reasoning can be improved using test-time
aggregation strategies, i.e., generating multiple samples and voting among
generated samples. While these improve performance, they often reach a
saturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated
feedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key
challenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can
over-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and
address errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to
identify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding
how many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too
soon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose
MAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty
as easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard
ones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error
localization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores.
Moreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with
three agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on
step-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure
sufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating
further rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5
and show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of
MAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by
4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with
baselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our
ablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe's RMs and multi-agent
communication.

| Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka |   Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string
processing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into
blocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence
of a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another
occurrence earlier in $T$. Due to numerous applications, LZ77 factorization is
one of the most studied problems on strings. In the 47 years since its
inception, several algorithms were developed for different models of
computation, including parallel, GPU, external-memory, and quantum. Remarkably,
however, the complexity of the most basic variant is still not settled: All
existing algorithms in the RAM model run in $\Omega(n)$ time, which is a
$\Theta(\log n)$ factor away from the lower bound of $\Omega(n/\log n)$
(following from the necessity to read the input, which takes $\Theta(n/\log n)$
space for $T\in\{0,1\}^{n}$).
  We present the first $o(n)$-time algorithm for LZ77 factorization, breaking
the linear-time barrier present for nearly 50 years. For $T\in\{0,1\}^{n}$, our
algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(n/\sqrt{\log n})=o(n)$ time and uses the optimal
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log n)$ working space. Our algorithm generalizes to
$\Sigma=[0..\sigma)$, where $\sigma=n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The runtime and
working space then become $\mathcal{O}((n\log\sigma)/\sqrt{\log n})$ and
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma} n)$. To obtain our algorithm, we prove a more
general result: For any constant $\epsilon\in(0,1)$ and $T\in[0..\sigma)^{n}$,
in $\mathcal{O}((n\log\sigma)/\sqrt{\log n})$ time and using
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma}n)$ space, we can construct an
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma}n)$-size index that, given any $P=T[j..j+\ell)$
(represented as $(j,\ell)$), computes the leftmost occurrence of $P$ in $T$ in
$\mathcal{O}(\log^{\epsilon}n)$ time. In other words, we solve the
indexing/online variant of the LZ77 problem.

| Experimental Evidence That Conversational Artificial Intelligence Can
  Steer Consumer Behavior Without Detection | Tobias Werner, Ivan Soraperra, Emilio Calvano, David C. Parkes, Iyad Rahwan |   Conversational AI models are becoming increasingly popular and are about to
replace traditional search engines for information retrieval and product
discovery. This raises concerns about monetization strategies and the potential
for subtle consumer manipulation. Companies may have financial incentives to
steer users toward search results or products in a conversation in ways that
are unnoticeable to consumers. Using a behavioral experiment, we show that
conversational AI models can indeed significantly shift consumer preferences.
We discuss implications and ask whether regulators are sufficiently prepared to
combat potential consumer deception.

M. Houff, F. G. Kondev, A. E. Lovell, A. T. Mohan, G. E. Morgan, C. Quick, G. Savard, K. S. Sharma, T. M. Sprouse, L. Varriano |   Atomic masses are a foundational quantity in our understanding of nuclear
structure, astrophysics and fundamental symmetries. The long-standing goal of
creating a predictive global model for the binding energy of a nucleus remains
a significant challenge, however, and prompts the need for precise measurements
of atomic masses to serve as anchor points for model developments. We present
precise mass measurements of neutron-rich Ru and Pd isotopes performed at the
Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade facility at Argonne National
Laboratory using the Canadian Penning Trap mass spectrometer. The masses of
$^{108}$Ru, $^{110}$Ru and $^{116}$Pd were measured to a relative mass
precision $\delta m/m \approx 10^{-8}$ via the phase-imaging
ion-cyclotron-resonance technique, and represent an improvement of
approximately an order of magnitude over previous measurements. These mass data
were used in conjunction with the physically interpretable machine learning
(PIML) model, which uses a mixture density neural network to model mass
excesses via a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The effects of our new mass
data on a Bayesian-updating of a PIML model are presented.

| MoRAG -- Multi-Fusion Retrieval Augmented Generation for Human Motion | Kalakonda Sai Shashank, Shubh Maheshwari, Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla |   We introduce MoRAG, a novel multi-part fusion based retrieval-augmented
generation strategy for text-based human motion generation. The method enhances
motion diffusion models by leveraging additional knowledge obtained through an
improved motion retrieval process. By effectively prompting large language
models (LLMs), we address spelling errors and rephrasing issues in motion
retrieval. Our approach utilizes a multi-part retrieval strategy to improve the
generalizability of motion retrieval across the language space. We create
diverse samples through the spatial composition of the retrieved motions.
Furthermore, by utilizing low-level, part-specific motion information, we can
construct motion samples for unseen text descriptions. Our experiments
demonstrate that our framework can serve as a plug-and-play module, improving
the performance of motion diffusion models. Code, pretrained models and sample

personalized rapid customization has emerged as a significant trend. In this
report, we introduce Takin AudioLLM, a series of techniques and models, mainly
including Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, specifically designed for
audiobook production. These models are capable of zero-shot speech production,
generating high-quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human
speech and facilitating individuals to customize the speech content according
to their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec
language model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a
multi-task training framework, capable of generating high-fidelity natural
speech in a zero-shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and
timbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while
advocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its
naturalness and expressiveness. Last, we propose the Takin Morphing system with
highly decoupled and advanced timbre and prosody modeling approaches, which
enables individuals to customize speech production with their preferred timbre
and prosody in a precise and controllable manner. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness and robustness of our Takin AudioLLM series models.

to sparse computation through expert routing, selectively activating only a
small subset of expert modules. However, sparse computation challenges
traditional training practices, as discrete expert routing hinders standard
backpropagation and thus gradient-based optimization, which are the cornerstone
of deep learning. To better pursue the scaling power of MoE, we introduce GRIN
(GRadient-INformed MoE training), which incorporates sparse gradient estimation
for expert routing and configures model parallelism to avoid token dropping.
Applying GRIN to autoregressive language modeling, we develop a top-2
16$\times$3.8B MoE model. Our model, with only 6.6B activated parameters,
outperforms a 7B dense model and matches the performance of a 14B dense model
trained on the same data. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks
demonstrate the potential of GRIN to significantly enhance MoE efficacy,
achieving 79.4 on MMLU, 83.7 on HellaSwag, 74.4 on HumanEval, and 58.9 on MATH.

| BERT-VBD: Vietnamese Multi-Document Summarization Framework | Tuan-Cuong Vuong, Trang Mai Xuan, Thien Van Luong |   In tackling the challenge of Multi-Document Summarization (MDS), numerous
methods have been proposed, spanning both extractive and abstractive
summarization techniques. However, each approach has its own limitations,
making it less effective to rely solely on either one. An emerging and
promising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractive
summarization methods. Despite the plethora of studies in this domain, research
on the combined methodology remains scarce, particularly in the context of
Vietnamese language processing. This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDS
framework leveraging a two-component pipeline architecture that integrates
extractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs an
extractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This is
achieved by a modification of the pre-trained BERT network, which derives
semantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet network
structures. The second component utilizes the VBD-LLaMA2-7B-50b model for
abstractive summarization, ultimately generating the final summary document.
Our proposed framework demonstrates a positive performance, attaining ROUGE-2
scores of 39.6% on the VN-MDS dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art
baselines.

| Einstein-dilaton-four-Maxwell Holographic Anisotropic Models | Irina Ya. Aref'eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov |   In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the
five-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell models has played a crucial role.
Typically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while
additional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A
more general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field
represents spatial longitudinal-transverse anisotropy, while the third and
fourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We
consider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero
temperature and five functions at non-zero temperature. Maxwell field related
to the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,
whereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.
We demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of
the seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations -- either the
dilaton or the vector potential equation -- follows from the Einstein equations
and the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi
identity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress-energy
tensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is
provided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to
three Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis
shows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein
equations and the equation for the vector potential

| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components
  for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco-Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram |   Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data
together with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal
components used. It is therefore important to determine the number of
significant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a
variational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for
estimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of
samples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This
eliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of
principal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.
This framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows
and columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),
and with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data
with arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as
cultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our
method on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may
underestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the
synthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical
dataset. These results suggest that it is broadly applicable across the life
sciences.

| Linguini: A benchmark for language-agnostic linguistic reasoning | Eduardo Sánchez, Belen Alastruey, Christophe Ropers, Pontus Stenetorp, Mikel Artetxe, Marta R. Costa-jussà |   We propose a new benchmark to measure a language model's linguistic reasoning
skills without relying on pre-existing language-specific knowledge. The test
covers 894 questions grouped in 160 problems across 75 (mostly) extremely
low-resource languages, extracted from the International Linguistic Olympiad
corpus. To attain high accuracy on this benchmark, models don't need previous
knowledge of the tested language, as all the information needed to solve the
linguistic puzzle is presented in the context. We find that, while all analyzed
models rank below 25% accuracy, there is a significant gap between open and
closed models, with the best-performing proprietary model at 24.05% and the
best-performing open model at 8.84%.

| From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the
  primordial black hole reheating scenario | Guillem Domènech, Jan Tränkle |   We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs
originate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight
PBHs with masses $M\lesssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat
it via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate
whether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH
reheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the
initial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer
functions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and
isocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation
of state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH
dominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the
spectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive
to $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density
fluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance
as a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
observations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the
initial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we
find that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several
future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas,
especially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any
early matter-dominated universe scenario.

| Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules | Anqi Zhang, Wilson S. Geisler |   Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We
investigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented
displays having well-separated potential target-object locations. Performance
was compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption
that the information from the different potential target locations is
statistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than
optimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the
implausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show
that three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical
results. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near
optimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the
central potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise
causes search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These
findings have far-reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks
and other identification tasks in humans and other animals.

| Far-from-equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann
  approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows
  $v_n$ | Vincenzo Nugara, Vincenzo Greco, Salvatore Plumari |   We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal
system in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution
function and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system
sizes $R$ and interaction strength $\eta/s$ and identify universality classes
based upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each
of this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $\hat
\gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results
highlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum
moments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to
a 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of
different sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a
similar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse
flow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system
size and $\eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and
their response functions, along with the impact of the $\eta/s$ and the system
transverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in
momentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow
$v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of
large opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems
evolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play
in this process.

Qwen2.5-Math and Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct-1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the
Qwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self-improvement
throughout the entire pipeline, from pre-training and post-training to
inference: (1) During the pre-training phase, Qwen2-Math-Instruct is utilized
to generate large-scale, high-quality mathematical data. (2) In the
post-training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive
sampling from Qwen2-Math-Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative
evolution of data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model,
it's possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the
next round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the
ultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct.
(3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling,
optimizing the model's performance.
  Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced
mathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics
datasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and
AIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math
competition problems.

| Computing the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two-Dimensional
  Strongly-Correlated Systems | Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn |   We show that the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time-reversal
invariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary-condition
dependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non-interacting and
strongly-correlated insulators. By introducing a family of quasi-single
particle states associated to the many-body ground state of an insulator, we
show that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant can be expressed as the integral of a
certain Berry connection over half the space of boundary conditions, providing
an alternative expression to the formulations that appear in [Lee et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. $\textbf{100}$, 186807 (2008)]. We show the equivalence of the
different many-body formulations of the invariant, and show how they reduce to
known band-theoretic results for Slater determinant ground states. Finally, we
apply our results to analytically calculate the invariant for the Kane-Mele
model with nonlocal (orbital) Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) interactions. This
rigorously establishes the topological nontriviality of the Kane-Mele model
with HK interactions, and represents one of the few exact calculations of the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a strongly-interacting system.

| Weak Lensing analysis of Abell 2390 using short exposures | A. Dutta, J. R. Peterson, T. Rose, M. Cianfaglione, A. Bonafede, G. Li, G. Sembroski |   We present a weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 2390 at z =
0.23 using second moment shape measurements made in 411 short 60s exposures.
The exposures are obtained in three broadband photometric filters (g, r, i)
using WIYN-ODI. Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a
moment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching
algorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The
measurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight
to obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim
simulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find
the mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We
also find the E-Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic
structures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical
and X-Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to
map large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of
the cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the
peaks are similar to X-Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster
and show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.

inability to audit the inference process), large training data requirements
with siloed data sources, and complicated metrics for measuring model utility.
In this work, we show empirically that including stronger baseline models in
healthcare ML evaluations has important downstream effects that aid
practitioners in addressing these challenges. Through a series of case studies,
we find that the common practice of omitting baselines or comparing against a
weak baseline model (e.g. a linear model with no optimization) obscures the
value of ML methods proposed in the research literature. Using these insights,
we propose some best practices that will enable practitioners to more
effectively study and deploy ML models in clinical settings.

| Revisiting Dark Photon Constraints from CMB Spectral Distortions | Jens Chluba, Bryce Cyr, Matthew C. Johnson |   Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide
stringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post-BBN (Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models
with COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.
Here, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark
photon conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous
works only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the
change to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon
distortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the
distortion has an opposite sign and a $\simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We
furthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover
the redshift range $\simeq 2\times 10^6-4\times 10^7$ between the $\mu$-era and
the end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints
for dark photon masses in the range $10^{-4}\,{\rm eV}\lesssim m_{\rm
dp}\lesssim 10^{-3}\,{\rm eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We
demonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon
to dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $\mu$-type distortion
independent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study
dark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with
CMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.

| Bi-objective trail-planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous
  environment | Cory M. Simon, Jeffrey Richley, Lucas Overbey, Darleen Perez-Lavin |   Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in
resource delivery, patrolling, information-gathering, agriculture, forest fire
fighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and
search-and-rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments -- with e.g.
rough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or
capturing robots -- should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of
risks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should
take the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the
team-level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward
from visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider
bi-objective trail-planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a
hazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed
graph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of
survival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a
robot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for
the Pareto-optimal robot-team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team
objectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive
the mission. A human decision-maker can then select trail plans that balance,
according to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony
optimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto-optimal set of
robot team trail plans. As a case study, we illustrate with an
information-gathering mission in an art museum.

| Pareto Data Framework: Steps Towards Resource-Efficient Decision Making
  Using Minimum Viable Data (MVD) | Tashfain Ahmed, Josh Siegel |   This paper introduces the Pareto Data Framework, an approach for identifying
and selecting the Minimum Viable Data (MVD) required for enabling machine
learning applications on constrained platforms such as embedded systems, mobile
devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We demonstrate that strategic
data reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing
bandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies
Minimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource-constrained
environments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient
practices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and
overprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for
optimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data
representation. An experimental methodology demonstrates effective acoustic
data characterization after downsampling, quantization, and truncation to
simulate reduced-fidelity sensors and network and storage constraints; results
shows that performance can be maintained up to 95\% with sample rates reduced
by 75\% and bit depths and clip length reduced by 50\% which translates into
substantial cost and resource reduction. These findings have implications on
the design and development of constrained systems. The paper also discusses
broader implications of the framework, including the potential to democratize
advanced AI technologies across IoT applications and sectors such as
agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing to improve access and multiply
the benefits of data-driven insights.

| Applications of Knowledge Distillation in Remote Sensing: A Survey | Yassine Himeur, Nour Aburaed, Omar Elharrouss, Iraklis Varlamis, Shadi Atalla, Wathiq Mansoor, Hussain Al Ahmad |   With the ever-growing complexity of models in the field of remote sensing
(RS), there is an increasing demand for solutions that balance model accuracy
with computational efficiency. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a
powerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,
complex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in
performance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and
its innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer
knowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact
and efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application
across various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and
historical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are
highlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational
efficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical
deployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of
KD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the
breadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case
studies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,
such as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review
discusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical
constraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive
overview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS. Through this
organization, the paper not only elucidates the current state of research in KD
but also sets the stage for future research opportunities, thereby contributing
significantly to both academic research and real-world applications.

| It depends: Varieties of defining growth dependence | Anja Janischewski, Katharina Bohnenberger, Matthias Kranke, Tobias Vogel, Riwan Driouich, Tobias Froese, Stefanie Gerold, Raphael Kaufmann, Lorenz Keyßer, Jannis Niethammer, Christopher Olk, Matthias Schmelzer, Aslı Yürük, Steffen Lange |   Many socio-economic systems require positive economic growth rates to
function properly. Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing
evidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,
these growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,
more and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth-dependent systems
and develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of
'growth dependence' still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,
which impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article
proposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the
concept of 'growth dependence' across socio-economic systems. We provide a
general definition consisting of four components that can be specified for
different empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of
measurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions
or properties of the system under investigation. According to our general
definition, a socio-economic system is growth-dependent if it requires a
long-term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to
maintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen
normative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to
three areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:
employment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies
demonstrate that whether or not a system is growth-dependent hinges not only on
the empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of
the concept of growth dependence. Our framework enables coherent, robust and
effective definitions and research questions, fostering comparability of
findings across different cases and disciplines.

| SPRMamba: Surgical Phase Recognition for Endoscopic Submucosal
  Dissection with Mamba | Xiangning Zhang, Jinnan Chen, Qingwei Zhang, Chengfeng Zhou, Zhengjie Zhang, Xiaobo Li, Dahong Qian |   Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive procedure
initially designed for the treatment of early gastric cancer but is now widely
used for various gastrointestinal lesions. Computer-assisted Surgery systems
have played a crucial role in improving the precision and safety of ESD
procedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognition
of surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesion
characteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real-time
surgical phase recognition algorithms. Existing surgical phase recognition
algorithms struggle to efficiently capture temporal contexts in video-based
scenarios, leading to insufficient performance. To address these issues, we
propose SPRMamba, a novel Mamba-based framework for ESD surgical phase
recognition. SPRMamba leverages the strengths of Mamba for long-term temporal
modeling while introducing the Scaled Residual TranMamba block to enhance the
capture of fine-grained details, overcoming the limitations of traditional
temporal models like Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformers.
Moreover, a Temporal Sample Strategy is introduced to accelerate the
processing, which is essential for real-time phase recognition in clinical
settings. Extensive testing on the ESD385 dataset and the cholecystectomy
Cholec80 dataset demonstrates that SPRMamba surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits greater robustness across various surgical phase
recognition tasks.

  Symmetric Group | Gian-Gabriel P. Garcia, J. Carlos Martínez Mori |   Given a collection of historical sports rankings, can one tell which player
is the greatest of all time (i.e., the GOAT)? In this work, we design a
data-driven random walk on the symmetric group to obtain a stationary
distribution over player rankings, spanning across different time periods in
sports history. We combine this distribution with a notion of stochastic
dominance to obtain a partial order over the players. We implement our methods
using publicly available data from the Association of Tennis Professionals
(ATP) and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) to find the GOATs in the

| Measuring Human and AI Values based on Generative Psychometrics with
  Large Language Models | Haoran Ye, Yuhang Xie, Yuanyi Ren, Hanjun Fang, Xin Zhang, Guojie Song |   Human values and their measurement are long-standing interdisciplinary
inquiry. Recent advances in AI have sparked renewed interest in this area, with
large language models (LLMs) emerging as both tools and subjects of value
measurement. This work introduces Generative Psychometrics for Values (GPV), an
LLM-based, data-driven value measurement paradigm, theoretically grounded in
text-revealed selective perceptions. We begin by fine-tuning an LLM for
accurate perception-level value measurement and verifying the capability of
LLMs to parse texts into perceptions, forming the core of the GPV pipeline.
Applying GPV to human-authored blogs, we demonstrate its stability, validity,
and superiority over prior psychological tools. Then, extending GPV to LLM
value measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometric
methodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free-form
outputs, enabling context-specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis of
measurement paradigms, indicating response biases of prior methods; and 3) an
attempt to bridge LLM values and their safety, revealing the predictive power
of different value systems and the impacts of various values on LLM safety.
Through interdisciplinary efforts, we aim to leverage AI for next-generation
psychometrics and psychometrics for value-aligned AI.

| FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated
  Long-Tailed Learning | Xiuhua Lu, Peng Li, Xuefeng Jiang |   Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy
in distributed machine learning. However, datasets distributed across each
client in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can
be globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly
affects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated
learning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it
fails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data.
This results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting
the equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a
methodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,
we propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the
local training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred
optimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state-of-the-art
methods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed
distribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10-LT and
CIFAR-100-LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of
model performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long-tailed
distribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.

| Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error
  Detection | Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia |   Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications. Doing
so requires overcoming the noise present on today's hardware. The quantum
approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling
up due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup
over state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems. However,
achieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require
fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant
implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection
code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the
algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with
up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we
propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance, and use it
to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance
to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our
model can be used to determine necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform
Goemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware. Our results demonstrate the
largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially
fault-tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date,
paving the way towards solving real-world applications with quantum computers.

| Cyclicity Analysis of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process | Vivek Kaushik |   In this thesis, we consider an $N$-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)
process satisfying the linear stochastic differential equation $d\mathbf x(t) =
- \mathbf B\mathbf x(t) dt + \boldsymbol \Sigma d \mathbf w(t).$ Here, $\mathbf
B$ is a fixed $N \times N$ circulant friction matrix whose eigenvalues have
positive real parts, $\boldsymbol \Sigma$ is a fixed $N \times M$ matrix. We
consider a signal propagation model governed by this OU process. In this model,
an underlying signal propagates throughout a network consisting of $N$ linked
sensors located in space. We interpret the $n$-th component of the OU process
as the measurement of the propagating effect made by the $n$-th sensor. The
matrix $\mathbf B$ represents the sensor network structure: if $\mathbf B$ has
first row $(b_1 \ , \ \dots \ , \ b_N),$ where $b_1>0$ and $b_2 \ , \ \dots \
,\ b_N \le 0,$ then the magnitude of $b_p$ quantifies how receptive the $n$-th
sensor is to activity within the $(n+p-1)$-th sensor. Finally, the $(m,n)$-th
entry of the matrix $\mathbf D = \frac{\boldsymbol \Sigma \boldsymbol
\Sigma^\text T}{2}$ is the covariance of the component noises injected into the
$m$-th and $n$-th sensors. For different choices of $\mathbf B$ and
$\boldsymbol \Sigma,$ we investigate whether Cyclicity Analysis enables us to
recover the structure of network. Roughly speaking, Cyclicity Analysis studies
the lead-lag dynamics pertaining to the components of a multivariate signal. We
specifically consider an $N \times N$ skew-symmetric matrix $\mathbf Q,$ known
as the lead matrix, in which the sign of its $(m,n)$-th entry captures the
lead-lag relationship between the $m$-th and $n$-th component OU processes. We
investigate whether the structure of the leading eigenvector of $\mathbf Q,$
the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of $\mathbf Q$ in
modulus, reflects the network structure induced by $\mathbf B.$

Our contributions include the design of symmetry-enriched learning models, the
development of advanced optimization techniques leveraging categorical
symmetries, and the theoretical analysis of their implications for model

| Brain-Streams: fMRI-to-Image Reconstruction with Multi-modal Guidance | Jaehoon Joo, Taejin Jeong, Seongjae Hwang |   Understanding how humans process visual information is one of the crucial
steps for unraveling the underlying mechanism of brain activity. Recently, this
curiosity has motivated the fMRI-to-image reconstruction task; given the fMRI
data from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual
stimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent
Diffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex
visual stimuli such as high-resolution natural images from vision datasets.
Despite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often
lack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.
Consequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere
visuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs
effectively incorporate multi-modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,
and image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image
generations. Specifically, inspired by the two-streams hypothesis suggesting
that perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain
regions, our framework, Brain-Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain
regions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from
semantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information
regions, Brain-Streams provides accurate multi-modal guidance to LDMs. We
validate the reconstruction ability of Brain-Streams both quantitatively and
qualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI
data.

| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal
  execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huyên Pham |   Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and
constraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity
markets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general
propagator model under linear functional inequality constraints. The optimal
control is given explicitly in terms of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers
and their conditional expectations, as a solution to a linear stochastic
Fredholm equation. We propose a stochastic version of the Uzawa algorithm on
the dual problem to construct the stochastic Lagrange multipliers numerically
via a stochastic projected gradient ascent, combined with a least-squares Monte
Carlo regression step to approximate their conditional expectations. We
illustrate our findings on two different practical applications with stochastic
signals: (i) an optimal execution problem with an exponential or a power law
decaying transient impact, with either a `no-shorting' constraint in the
presence of a `sell' signal, a `no-buying' constraint in the presence of a
`buy' signal or a stochastic `stop-trading' constraint whenever the exogenous
price drops below a specified reference level; (ii) a battery storage problem
with instantaneous operating costs, seasonal signals and fixed constraints on
both the charging power and the load capacity of the battery.

not an easy task to perform at scale, especially in multiple languages. In this
paper, we propose a novel neural retriever architecture that tackles this

freelancer profiles by leveraging pre-trained multilingual language models. The
latter are used as backbone for a custom transformer architecture that aims to
keep the structure of the profiles and project. This model is trained with a
contrastive loss on historical data. Thanks to several experiments, we show
that this approach effectively captures skill matching similarity and
facilitates efficient matching, outperforming traditional methods.

| An Efficient Projection-Based Next-best-view Planning Framework for
  Reconstruction of Unknown Objects | Zhizhou Jia, Shaohui Zhang, Qun Hao |   Efficiently and completely capturing the three-dimensional data of an object
is a fundamental problem in industrial and robotic applications. The task of
next-best-view (NBV) planning is to infer the pose of the next viewpoint based
on the current data, and gradually realize the complete three-dimensional
reconstruction. Many existing algorithms, however, suffer a large computational
burden due to the use of ray-casting. To address this, this paper proposes a
projection-based NBV planning framework. It can select the next best view at an
extremely fast speed while ensuring the complete scanning of the object.
Specifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into
ellipsoids based on the voxel structure.Then, the next best view is selected
from the candidate views using a projection-based viewpoint quality evaluation
function in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy. This process
replaces the ray-casting in voxel structures, significantly improving the
computational efficiency. Comparative experiments with other algorithms in a
simulation environment show that the framework proposed in this paper can
achieve 10 times efficiency improvement on the basis of capturing roughly the
same coverage. The real-world experimental results also prove the efficiency
and feasibility of the framework.

| Undersampling effects on observed periods of coronal oscillations | Daye Lim, Tom Van Doorsselaere, Valery M. Nakariakov, Dmitrii Y. Kolotkov, Yuhang Gao, David Berghmans |   Context. Recent observations of decayless transverse oscillations have shown
two branches in the relationship between periods and loop lengths. One is a
linear relationship, interpreted as a standing mode. The other shows almost no
correlation and has not yet been interpreted conclusively. Aims. We
investigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless
oscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely
follow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations
are standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations
where the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase
are randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal
by considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of
telescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast
Fourier transform. Results. When the sampling cadence is getting closer to the
actual oscillation period, a tendency for overestimating periods in short loops
is enhanced. The relationship between loop lengths and periods of the sampled
signals shows the two branches as in the observation. Conclusions. We find that
long periods of decayless oscillations occurring in short loops could be the
result of undersampling.

| Enwrapped Perylene Bisimide Enables Room Temperature Polariton Lasing
  and Photonic Lattices | Dominik Horneber, Johannes Düreth, Tim Schembri, Simon Betzold, Matthias Stolte, Sven Höfling, Frank Würthner, Sebastian Klembt |   Perylene bisimides (PBIs) are organic dyes with photoluminescence quantum
yields (PLQY) close to unity in solution and great thermal and photo-chemical
stability. These features alongside the tunability of their solid-state packing
arrangement via chemical functionalization make this material class an
excellent candidate for exciton-polariton lasing at room temperature. Polariton
lasing is well understood in III-V semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures,
however, the search for emitter materials for robust and versatile room
temperature applications is ongoing. While e.g. perovskites and several organic
materials have been identified to support polariton lasing, many of these
materials lack tunability and long-term stability under ambient conditions.
Here, we fabricate optical microcavities using a strongly enwrapped PBI
chromophore with prevailing monomer-like absorption and emission properties in
the solid state. Voluminous bay-substituents prevent stacking induced
PLQY-quenching, thereby enabling polariton lasing at room temperature.
Additionally, photonic confinement in single hemispheric resonators is
demonstrated leading to localized polaritonic modes with discrete energies, as
well as optical lattices revealing distinct polaritonic band-structures. Due to
the possibility of tunable properties by the precise control of the solid-state
packing arrangement of PBI emitters, our results pave the way for
polarization-dependent light-matter coupling, including topological photonic
effects within oriented crystalline thin-film microcavity structures.

| IMRL: Integrating Visual, Physical, Temporal, and Geometric
  Representations for Enhanced Food Acquisition | Rui Liu, Zahiruddin Mahammad, Amisha Bhaskar, Pratap Tokekar |   Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality
of life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse
food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents
unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric
information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g.,
color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially
when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance.
We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition.
Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy
based on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, such
representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse
acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which
integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance
the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach
captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular,
liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and
introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and
assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies
based on context, improving the robot's capability to handle diverse food
acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach's
robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations,
including zero-shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves
improvement up to $35\%$ in success rate compared with the best-performing
baseline.

| Uncovering liquid-substrate fluctuation effects on crystal growth and
  disordered hyperuniformity of two-dimensional materials | S. K. Mkhonta, Zhi-Feng Huang, K. R. Elder |   We investigate the growth of two-dimensional (2D) crystals on fluctuating
surfaces using a phase field crystal model that is relevant on atomic length
and diffusive time scales. Motivated by recent experiments which achieved
unprecedented fast growth of large-size high-quality 2D crystals on liquid
substrates, we uncover novel effects of liquid surfaces on microstructural
ordering. We find that substrate fluctuations generate short-ranged noise that
speeds up crystallization and grain growth of the overlayer, surpassing that of
free-standing system. Coupling to the liquid substrate fluctuations can also
modulate local randomness, leading to intriguing disordered structures with
hidden spatial order, i.e., disordered hyperuniformity. These results reveal
the physical mechanisms underlying the fast growth of 2D crystals on liquid
surfaces and demonstrate a novel strategy for synthesizing disordered
hyperuniform thin film structures.

| The Impact of Element Ordering on LM Agent Performance | Wayne Chi, Ameet Talwalkar, Chris Donahue |   There has been a surge of interest in language model agents that can navigate
virtual environments such as the web or desktop. To navigate such environments,
agents benefit from information on the various elements (e.g., buttons, text,
or images) present. It remains unclear which element attributes have the
greatest impact on agent performance, especially in environments that only
provide a graphical representation (i.e., pixels). Here we find that the
ordering in which elements are presented to the language model is surprisingly
impactful--randomizing element ordering in a webpage degrades agent performance
comparably to removing all visible text from an agent's state representation.
While a webpage provides a hierarchical ordering of elements, there is no such
ordering when parsing elements directly from pixels. Moreover, as tasks become
more challenging and models more sophisticated, our experiments suggest that
the impact of ordering increases. Finding an effective ordering is non-trivial.
We investigate the impact of various element ordering methods in web and
desktop environments. We find that dimensionality reduction provides a viable
ordering for pixel-only environments. We train a UI element detection model to
derive elements from pixels and apply our findings to an agent
benchmark--OmniACT--where we only have access to pixels. Our method completes
more than two times as many tasks on average relative to the previous
state-of-the-art.

| Quark saturation in the QCD phase diagram | Marcus Bluhm, Yuki Fujimoto, Larry McLerran, Marlene Nahrgang |   We determine the onset of Quarkyonic Matter corresponding to values of
temperature and baryon chemical potential at which the quark phase space
density becomes one. At zero temperature for baryon chemical potentials below
the mass of the Lambda baryon, only nucleons contribute to the quark density.
This is different at finite temperature, where all baryons, mesons and their
resonances can be excited and thus add quarks to the phase space. The
probability density to find a quark inside a hadron is determined using the
Yukawa ansatz of the IdylliQ model of Quarkyonic Matter. We estimate separately
the magnitude of the various contributions of nucleons, Delta baryons, pions as
well as further hadrons and resonances. The uncertainty in the parametrization
of the probability density to find a quark inside a nucleon is spanned by
assuming that at zero temperature the transition density to Quarkyonic Matter
is between one and three times that of nuclear matter. Various predictions for
a possible critical point associated with the chiral phase transition are found

| Towards Interpretable End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Prediction:
  Utilizing Administrative Claims Data with Explainable AI Techniques | Yubo Li, Saba Al-Sayouri, Rema Padman |   This study explores the potential of utilizing administrative claims data,
combined with advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, to
predict the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to End-Stage Renal
Disease (ESRD). We analyze a comprehensive, 10-year dataset provided by a major
health insurance organization to develop prediction models for multiple
observation windows using traditional machine learning methods such as Random
Forest and XGBoost as well as deep learning approaches such as Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) networks. Our findings demonstrate that the LSTM model,
particularly with a 24-month observation window, exhibits superior performance
in predicting ESRD progression, outperforming existing models in the
literature. We further apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to
enhance interpretability, providing insights into the impact of individual
features on predictions at the individual patient level. This study underscores
the value of leveraging administrative claims data for CKD management and
predicting ESRD progression.

| Unveiling the Secrets of New Physics Through Top Quark Tagging | Rameswar Sahu, Saiyad Ashanujjaman, Kirtiman Ghosh |   The ubiquity of top-rich final states in the context of beyond the Standard
Model (BSM) searches has led to their status as extensively studied signatures
at the LHC. Over the past decade, numerous endeavours have been undertaken in
the literature to develop methods for efficiently distinguishing boosted top
quark jets from QCD jets. Although cut-based strategies for boosted top
tagging, which rely on substructure information from fat jets resulting from
the hadronic decay of boosted top quarks, were introduced in the literature as
early as 2008, recent years have witnessed a surge in the utilization of
machine learning-based approaches for the classification of top-jets from QCD
jets. The review focuses on the present status of boosted top tagging and its
application for BSM searchers.

| The $η_c$-meson leading-twist distribution amplitude | Benoît Blossier, Mariane Mangin-Brinet, José Manuel Morgado Chávez, Teseo San José |   In this project, we employ the short-distance factorization to compute the
distribution amplitude of the $\eta_c$-meson from Lattice QCD at leading twist.
We employ a set of CLS $N_f=2$ ensembles at three lattice spacings and various
quark masses to extrapolate the pseudo distribution to the physical point in
the isospin limit. We solve the inverse problem modeling the distribution
amplitude, and we match our results to the light-cone in the
$\overline{\text{MS}}$-scheme. We include a complete error budget, and we
compare to two alternative approaches: non-relativistic QCD and Dyson-Schwinger
equations, finding good agreement with the latter but not with the former.

| The asymptotic behavior of solutions to a doubly degenerate
  chemotaxis-consumption system in two-dimensional setting | Duan Wu |   The present work proceeds to consider the convergence of the solutions to the
following doubly degenerate chemotaxis-consumption system \begin{align*}
\left\{ \begin{array}{r@{\,}l@{\quad}l@{\,}c}
&u_{t}=\nabla\cdot\big(u^{m-1}v\nabla v\big)-\nabla\cdot\big(f(u)v\nabla

no-flux boundary conditions in a smoothly bounded convex domain $\Omega\subset
\R^2$, where the nonnegative function $f\in C^1([0,\infty))$ is asked to
satisfy $f(s)\le C_fs^{\al}$ with $\al, C_f>0$ for all $s\ge 1$.
  The global existence of weak solutions or classical solutions to the above
system has been established in both one- and two-dimensional bounded convex
domains in previous works. However, the results concerning the large time
behavior are still constrained to one dimension due to the lack of a
Harnack-type inequality in the two-dimensional case. In this note, we
complement this result by using the Moser iteration technique and building a

| ReLU Surrogates in Mixed-Integer MPC for Irrigation Scheduling | Bernard T. Agyeman, Jinfeng Liu, Sirish L. Shah |   Efficient water management in agriculture is important for mitigating the
growing freshwater scarcity crisis. Mixed-integer Model Predictive Control
(MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex
scheduling problems in agricultural irrigation. However, the computational
complexity of mixed-integer MPC still poses a significant challenge,
particularly in large-scale applications. This study proposes an approach to
enhance the computational efficiency of mixed-integer MPC-based irrigation
schedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture
dynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed-integer linear
representation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the
mixed-integer MPC-based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a
mixed-integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed-integer
nonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global
optimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated
through comparative studies conducted on a large-scale agricultural field
across two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models,
specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used
triggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU-based approach significantly
reduces solution times -- by up to 99.5\% -- while achieving comparable
performance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water
Use Efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, the ReLU-based approach maintains enhanced
performance in terms of total prescribed irrigation and IWUE compared to the
widely-used triggered irrigation scheduling method.

| Design of Ligand-Binding Proteins with Atomic Flow Matching | Junqi Liu, Shaoning Li, Chence Shi, Zhi Yang, Jian Tang |   Designing novel proteins that bind to small molecules is a long-standing
challenge in computational biology, with applications in developing catalysts,
biosensors, and more. Current computational methods rely on the assumption that
the binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible,
as conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon
binding. In this work, we formulate proteins and molecules as unified
biotokens, and present AtomFlow, a novel deep generative model under the
flow-matching framework for the design of ligand-binding proteins from the 2D
target molecular graph alone. Operating on representative atoms of biotokens,
AtomFlow captures the flexibility of ligands and generates ligand conformations
and protein backbone structures iteratively. We consider the multi-scale nature
of biotokens and demonstrate that AtomFlow can be effectively trained on a
subset of structures from the Protein Data Bank, by matching flow vector field
using an SE(3) equivariant structure prediction network. Experimental results
show that our method can generate high fidelity ligand-binding proteins and
achieve performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model RFDiffusionAA,
while not requiring bound ligand structures. As a general framework, AtomFlow
holds the potential to be applied to various biomolecule generation tasks in
the future.

| Denoising diffusion models for high-resolution microscopy image
  restoration | Pamela Osuna-Vargas, Maren H. Wehrheim, Lucas Zinz, Johanna Rahm, Ashwin Balakrishnan, Alexandra Kaminer, Mike Heilemann, Matthias Kaschube |   Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at
the nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological
organization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of
fluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses
remain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced
laser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and
increased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high-resolution
images by conditioning the model on low-resolution information. Additionally,
the probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images
that tend to further increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We show that our model
achieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously
best-performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly,
while any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but
not all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all
four data sets, suggesting high generalizability.

| Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Via Data Pruning | Andrea Napoli, Paul White |   The removal of carefully-selected examples from training data has recently
emerged as an effective way of improving the robustness of machine learning
models. However, the best way to select these examples remains an open
question. In this paper, we consider the problem from the perspective of
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). We propose AdaPrune, a method for UDA
whereby training examples are removed to attempt to align the training
distribution to that of the target data. By adopting the maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) as the criterion for alignment, the problem can be neatly
formulated and solved as an integer quadratic program. We evaluate our approach
on a real-world domain shift task of bioacoustic event detection. As a method
for UDA, we show that AdaPrune outperforms related techniques, and is
complementary to other UDA algorithms such as CORAL. Our analysis of the
relationship between the MMD and model accuracy, along with t-SNE plots,
validate the proposed method as a principled and well-founded way of performing
data pruning.

| The elastica sling | Alessandro Cazzolli, Francesco Dal Corso |   The nonlinear mechanics of a flexible elastic rod constrained at its edges by
a pair of sliding sleeves is analyzed. The planar equilibrium configurations of
this variable-length elastica are found to have shape defined only by the
inclination of the two constraints, while their distance is responsible only
for scaling the size. By extending the theoretical stability criterion
available for systems under isoperimetric constraints to the case of variable
domains, the existence of no more than one stable equilibrium solution is
revealed. The set of sliding sleeves' inclination pairs for which the stability
is lost are identified. Such critical conditions allow the indefinite ejection
of the flexible rod from the sliding sleeves, thus realizing an elastica sling.
Finally, the theoretical findings are validated by experiments on a physical
prototype. The present results lead to a novel actuation principle that may
find application as a mechanism in energy harvesting, wave mitigation devices,
and soft robotic locomotion.

| Online Refractive Camera Model Calibration in Visual Inertial Odometry | Mohit Singh, Kostas Alexis |   This paper presents a general refractive camera model and online
co-estimation of odometry and the refractive index of unknown media. This
enables operation in diverse and varying refractive fluids, given only the
camera calibration in air. The refractive index is estimated online as a state
variable of a monocular visual-inertial odometry framework in an iterative
formulation using the proposed camera model. The method was verified on data
collected using an underwater robot traversing inside a pool. The evaluations
demonstrate convergence to the ideal refractive index for water despite
significant perturbations in the initialization. Simultaneously, the approach
enables on-par visual-inertial odometry performance in refractive media without
prior knowledge of the refractive index or requirement of medium-specific
camera calibration.

| Influence of dislocations in multilayer graphene stacks: A phase field
  crystal study | K. R. Elder, Zhi-Feng Huang, T. Ala-Nissila |   In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene
stacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a
recently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems
incorporating out-of-plane deformations and parameterized to match to density
functional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems. The
specific configuration considered consists of one monolayer containing four
$5|7$ dislocations (i.e., two dislocation dipoles) sandwiched in between
perfect graphene layers. The study reveals how the strain field from the
dislocations in the defected layer leads to out-of-plane deformations that in
turn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are
made for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a
defect-free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and
system size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by
roughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence
across the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height
profiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.

| PAD-FT: A Lightweight Defense for Backdoor Attacks via Data Purification
  and Fine-Tuning | Yukai Xu, Yujie Gu, Kouichi Sakurai |   Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks,
particularly as recent advancements have led to increasingly subtle
implantation, making the defense more challenging. Existing defense mechanisms
typically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and
involve retraining an auxiliary model or fine-tuning the entire victim model.
However, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always
feasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and
lightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD-FT, that does not require an
additional clean dataset and fine-tunes only a very small part of the model to
disinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a
simple data purification process to identify and select the most-likely clean
data from the poisoned training dataset. The self-purified clean dataset is
then used for activation clipping and fine-tuning only the last classification
layer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation
clipping, and classifier fine-tuning, our mechanism PAD-FT demonstrates
superior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as
confirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.

| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing
  data in Irish sagas | P. MacCarron |   For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts
in order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify
similarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the
significance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture
requires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and
often impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the
network of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that
the top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent
with central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has
been lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust
to a large random removal of edges.

| The repetition threshold for ternary rich words | James D. Currie, Lucas Mol, Jarkko Peltomäki |   In 2014, Vesti proposed the problem of determining the repetition threshold
for infinite rich words, i.e., for infinite words in which all factors of
length $n$ contain $n$ distinct nonempty palindromic factors. In 2020, Currie,
Mol, and Rampersad proved a conjecture of Baranwal and Shallit that the
repetition threshold for binary rich words is $2 + \sqrt{2}/2$. In this paper,
we prove a structure theorem for $16/7$-power-free ternary rich words. Using
the structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich
words is $1 + 1/(3 - \mu) \approx 2.25876324$, where $\mu$ is the unique real
root of the polynomial $x^3 - 2x^2 - 1$.

| Fitting Multilevel Factor Models | Tetiana Parshakova, Trevor Hastie, Stephen Boyd |   We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance
given by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~\cite{parshakova2023factor}. We
develop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of
the observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and
maintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved
through a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive
definite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of an invertible PSD MLR matrix
is also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the
recursive Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of
the inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky
factorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities,
yielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement. This paper is
accompanied by an open-source package that implements the proposed methods.

| Drifts of the sub-stellar points of the TRAPPIST-1 planets | Revol Alexandre, Émeline Bolmont, Mariana Sastre, Gabriel Tobie, Anne-Sophie Libert, Mathilde Kervazo, Sergi Blanco-Cuaresma |   Accurate modeling of tidal interactions is crucial for interpreting recent
JWST observations of the thermal emissions of TRAPPIST-1~b and c and for
characterizing the surface conditions and potential habitability of the other
planets in the system. Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by
tidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to
their proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the
TRAPPIST-1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In
this work, we present the recent implementation of the co-planar tidal torque
and forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N-body code
Posidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using
a tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of
each planet by taking into account their multi-layer internal structure
computed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets
are not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state.
Planet-planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and
tides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a
result, the sub-stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and
long-timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with
periods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.

| Quantum Magic and Multi-Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei | Florian Brökemeier, S. Momme Hengstenberg, James W. T. Keeble, Caroline E. P. Robin, Federico Rocco, Martin J. Savage |   Motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the
quantum complexity of $p$-shell and $sd$-shell nuclei. Valence-space nuclear
shell-model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit
registers using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$-shell and 24
qubits for the $sd$-shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement
($n$-tangles) and magic (non-stabilizerness) are determined. While exact
evaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of
active nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex
nuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique
is introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed
nuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\sim 8$ for some
nuclei. Significant multi-nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$-shell,
dominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of
magic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on
the path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion.
These results indicate that quantum-computing resources will accelerate
precision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.

| Post-Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a
  massive, rotating object | Lorenzo Iorio |   The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the
general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring
components of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are
analytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level. To the Newtonian
order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as
well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation
in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the
primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first
to 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system
along an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred
close to the Sun's flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due
to the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of
microarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for
the post-Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)
spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of
the latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current
(formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would
bring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the
predicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not
changed by any of the post--Keplerian accelerations considered. The
calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any
alternative models of gravity as well.

| Generalized Robot Learning Framework | Jiahuan Yan, Zhouyang Hong, Yu Zhao, Yu Tian, Yunxin Liu, Travis Davies, Luhui Hu |   Imitation based robot learning has recently gained significant attention in
the robotics field due to its theoretical potential for transferability and
generalizability. However, it remains notoriously costly, both in terms of
hardware and data collection, and deploying it in real-world environments
demands meticulous setup of robots and precise experimental conditions. In this
paper, we present a low-cost robot learning framework that is both easily
reproducible and transferable to various robots and environments. We
demonstrate that deployable imitation learning can be successfully applied even
to industrial-grade robots, not just expensive collaborative robotic arms.
Furthermore, our results show that multi-task robot learning is achievable with
simple network architectures and fewer demonstrations than previously thought
necessary. As the current evaluating method is almost subjective when it comes
to real-world manipulation tasks, we propose Voting Positive Rate (VPR) - a
novel evaluation strategy that provides a more objective assessment of
performance. We conduct an extensive comparison of success rates across various
self-designed tasks to validate our approach. To foster collaboration and
support the robot learning community, we have open-sourced all relevant
datasets and model checkpoints, available at huggingface.co/ZhiChengAI.

leave uncertainty about their true semantic understanding. To alleviate this,
we release paraphrasus, a benchmark designed for multi-dimensional assessment
of paraphrase detection models and finer model selection. We find that
paraphrase detection models under a fine-grained evaluation lens exhibit
trade-offs that cannot be captured through a single classification dataset.

but may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have
been several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but
most of them are not data-driven or training-based. In this paper, we are
motivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel
model architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts
and then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines
to annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt-response samples, then
add language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We
train the language model by the thoughts-augmented data and successfully let
the thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally
output more reasonable responses. Both qualitative examples and quantitative
results validate the effectiveness and performance of TaS. Our code is

| Artemis: Efficient Commit-and-Prove SNARKs for zkML | Hidde Lycklama, Alexander Viand, Nikolay Avramov, Nicolas Küchler, Anwar Hithnawi |   The widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) in various critical
applications, from healthcare to autonomous systems, has raised significant
concerns about privacy, accountability, and trustworthiness. To address these
concerns, recent research has focused on developing zero-knowledge machine
learning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of
ML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have
substantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily
optimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the
substantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the
model and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new
Commit-and-Prove SNARK (CP-SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that
effectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML
pipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white-box use of the
underlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic
polynomial commitment and only makes black-box use of the proof system. As a
result, Artemis is compatible with state-of-the-art proof systems without
trusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP-SNARKs, evaluate
their performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial
improvements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover
costs and maintaining efficiency even for large-scale models. For example, for
the VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from
11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML
towards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and
complex ML models.

$\mathbb{R}$-divisor $B_Y$ on $Y$ such that the pair $(Y,B_Y)$ is log
canonical, we prove that any $(K_Y+B_Y)$-MMP terminates with a minimal model
$(Y',B_{Y'})$ of $(Y,B_Y)$, where $Y'$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial primitive
Enriques variety with canonical singularities. Finally, we investigate the

| Numerical renormalization group calculations for magnetic impurity
  systems with spin-orbit coupling and crystal-field effects | Aitor Calvo-Fernández, María Blanco-Rey, Asier Eiguren |   Exploiting symmetries in the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method
significantly enhances performance by improving accuracy, increasing
computational speed, and optimizing memory efficiency. Published codes focus on
continuous rotations and unitary groups, which generally are not applicable to
systems with strong crystal-field effects. The PointGroupNRG code implements
symmetries related to discrete rotation groups, which are defined by the user
in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, together with particle conservation
and spin rotation symmetries. In this paper we present a new version of the
code that extends the available finite groups, previously limited to simply
reducible point groups, in a way that all point and double groups become
accessible. It also includes the full spin-orbital rotation group. Moreover, to
improve the code's flexibility for impurities with complex interactions, this
new version allows to choose between a standard Anderson Hamiltonian for the
impurity or, as another novel feature, an ionic model that requires only the
spectrum and the impurity Lehmann amplitudes.

| Quantum-like nonlinear interferometry with frequency-engineered
  classical light | Romain Dalidet, Anthony Martin, Grégory Sauder, Laurent Labonté, Sébastien Tanzilli |   Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic
entanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits. Nonlinear
optics has served as a workhorse for the generation of entangled photon pairs,
ensuring both energy and phase conservation, but at the cost of limited rate
and degraded signal-to-noise ratio compared to laser-based interferometry
approaches. We present a \"quantum-like\" nonlinear optical method that reaches
super-resolution in single-photon detection regime. This is achieved by
replacing photon-pairs by coherent states of light, mimicking quantum
properties through classical nonlinear optics processes. Our scheme utilizes
two high-brightness lasers. This results in a substantially greater
signal-to-noise ratio compared to its quantum counterpart. Such an approach
paves the way to significantly reduced acquisition times, providing a pathway
to explore signals across a broader range of bandwidth. The need to increase
the frequency bandwidth of the quantum sensor significantly motivates the
potential applications of this pathway.

stress and burnout among cybersecurity professionals using a quantitative
survey approach guided by the Job Demands-Resources model. Analysis of
responses from 50 cybersecurity practitioners reveals an alarming reality: 44%
report experiencing severe work-related stress and burnout, while an additional
28% are uncertain about their condition. The demanding nature of cybersecurity
roles, unrealistic expectations, and unsupportive organizational cultures
emerge as primary factors fueling this crisis. Notably, 66% of respondents
perceive cybersecurity jobs as more stressful than other IT positions, with 84%
facing additional challenges due to the pandemic and recent high-profile
breaches. The study finds that most cybersecurity experts are reluctant to
report their struggles to management, perpetuating a cycle of silence and
neglect. To address this critical issue, the paper recommends that
organizations foster supportive work environments, implement mindfulness
programs, and address systemic challenges. By prioritizing the mental health of

| Using Large Language Models to Generate Clinical Trial Tables and
  Figures | Yumeng Yang, Peter Krusche, Kristyn Pantoja, Cheng Shi, Ethan Ludmir, Kirk Roberts, Gen Zhu |   Tables, figures, and listings (TFLs) are essential tools for summarizing
clinical trial data. Creation of TFLs for reporting activities is often a
time-consuming task encountered routinely during the execution of clinical
trials. This study explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate
the generation of TFLs through prompt engineering and few-shot transfer
learning. Using public clinical trial data in ADaM format, our results
demonstrated that LLMs can efficiently generate TFLs with prompt instructions,
showcasing their potential in this domain. Furthermore, we developed a
conservational agent named Clinical Trial TFL Generation Agent: An app that
matches user queries to predefined prompts that produce customized programs to
generate specific predefined TFLs.

| Handling Long-Term Safety and Uncertainty in Safe Reinforcement Learning | Jonas Günster, Puze Liu, Jan Peters, Davide Tateo |   Safety is one of the key issues preventing the deployment of reinforcement
learning techniques in real-world robots. While most approaches in the Safe
Reinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and
robot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them
in complex real-world settings. Instead, model-based approaches that
incorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning
framework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on
the real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot
dynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task-specific and hard
to obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to
compute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long-term safety
requirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe
exploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus
on ensuring long-term safety and handling of uncertainty. Our approach is
competitive or superior to state-of-the-art methods in final performance while
maintaining safer behavior during training.

| Quasiperiodic Floquet-Gibbs states in Rydberg atomic systems | Wilson S. Martins, Federico Carollo, Kay Brandner, Igor Lesanovsky |   Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by
fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an
equilibrium-like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet-Magnus
Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi's golden rule, we show
that such Floquet-Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated
Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab-frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function
of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the
system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which
is necessary to uphold high-lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To
corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five
interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate
numerically that the second-order Floquet-Gibbs state of this system is
essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding
Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently
large.

| Understanding the Effects of the Baidu-ULTR Logging Policy on Two-Tower
  Models | Morris de Haan, Philipp Hager |   Despite the popularity of the two-tower model for unbiased learning to rank
(ULTR) tasks, recent work suggests that it suffers from a major limitation that
could lead to its collapse in industry applications: the problem of logging
policy confounding. Several potential solutions have even been proposed;
however, the evaluation of these methods was mostly conducted using
semi-synthetic simulation experiments. This paper bridges the gap between
theory and practice by investigating the confounding problem on the largest
real-world dataset, Baidu-ULTR. Our main contributions are threefold: 1) we
show that the conditions for the confounding problem are given on Baidu-ULTR,
2) the confounding problem bears no significant effect on the two-tower model,
and 3) we point to a potential mismatch between expert annotations, the golden
standard in ULTR, and user click behavior.

| ASR Benchmarking: Need for a More Representative Conversational Dataset | Gaurav Maheshwari, Dmitry Ivanov, Théo Johannet, Kevin El Haddad |   Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable
performance on widely used benchmarks such as LibriSpeech and Fleurs. However,
these benchmarks do not adequately reflect the complexities of real-world
conversational environments, where speech is often unstructured and contains
disfluencies such as pauses, interruptions, and diverse accents. In this study,
we introduce a multilingual conversational dataset, derived from TalkBank,
consisting of unstructured phone conversation between adults. Our results show
a significant performance drop across various state-of-the-art ASR models when
tested in conversational settings. Furthermore, we observe a correlation
between Word Error Rate and the presence of speech disfluencies, highlighting
the critical need for more realistic, conversational ASR benchmarks.

| DynaMo: In-Domain Dynamics Pretraining for Visuo-Motor Control | Zichen Jeff Cui, Hengkai Pan, Aadhithya Iyer, Siddhant Haldar, Lerrel Pinto |   Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex
visuomotor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to
thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual
observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual
representations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or
trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present
DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual
representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a
latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of
image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without
augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.
Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet
datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real
environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly
improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised
learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo
hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,
and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and
measure its impact on downstream policy performance. Robot videos are best

models that redefines the conventional predetermined-resolution approach in
visual processing. Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,
which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions
into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to
generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning
with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary
Position Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional
information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for
processing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception
capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL
investigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By
scaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the
amount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive
performance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to
leading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal
benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models. Code is available at

| Bundle Adjustment in the Eager Mode | Zitong Zhan, Huan Xu, Zihang Fang, Xinpeng Wei, Yaoyu Hu, Chen Wang |   Bundle adjustment (BA) is a critical technique in various robotic
applications, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), augmented
reality (AR), and photogrammetry. BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses
and 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance
of deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to
integrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and
performance. However, widely-used C++-based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,
g$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries
like PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of
debugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we
introduce an eager-mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,
providing PyTorch-compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach
includes GPU-accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for
2nd-order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear
solvers. Our eager-mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency,
achieving an average speedup of 18.5$\times$, 22$\times$, and 23$\times$
compared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.

| Massively Multi-Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context | Felix B Mueller, Julian Tanke, Juergen Gall |   Forecasting long-term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of
human behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input
sequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby
people can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene-aware social
transformer model (SAST) to forecast long-term (10s) human motion motion.
Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely
varying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal
convolutional encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer-based bottleneck
that allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model
the conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We
benchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to
16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously. Our model
outperforms other approaches in terms of realism and diversity on different
metrics and in a user study. Code is available at

| SPECTER: An Instrument Concept for CMB Spectral Distortion Measurements
  with Enhanced Sensitivity | Alina Sabyr, Carlos Sierra, J. Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon |   Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a
perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from
fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\mu$-distortion) to late-time
baryonic feedback processes (y-distortion). While the y-distortion can be
detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude
smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a
serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\mu$
arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the
primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here,
we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly
detecting $\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but
with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we
optimize the instrument's configuration to target $\mu$ while robustly
marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike
Fourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their
individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing
significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion at $\approx 5\sigma$ (10$\sigma$)
assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission
duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized
configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular
resolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally
measure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic
correction at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total
thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.

  Evidence for magnetospheric accretion in the young isolated planetary-mass

Ringqvist, Dorian Demars, Markus Janson, Mickaël Bonnefoy, Yuhiko Aoyama, Gabriel-Dominique Marleau, Catherine Dougados, Judit Szulágyi, Thanawuth Thanathibodee |   Accretion among planets is a poorly understood phenomenon, due to lack of
both observational and theoretical studies. Detection of emission lines from
accreting gas giants facilitate detailed investigations into this process. This
work presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known
young, planetary-mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf
2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7-21 Mj and age 5-45 Myr, located at 45+-2
pc. We obtained the first high-resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target
with VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near-UV to visible wavelengths (3200-6800
AA). We report resolved H3-H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.
Based on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+-1
km/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR
excess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of
the parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+-63 K and radius to 1.5+-0.1
Rj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet-surface shock model
implies a pre-shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,-40) km/s and a pre-shock
density of log(n0/cm^-3)=14(+0,-5). Pre-shock velocity points to a mass of
6(+8,-4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary
Lline-Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of
1.4(+2.8,-0.9)x10^-8 Mj/yr.

from its predecessor, CodeQwen1.5. This series includes two models:
Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B. As a code-specific model,
Qwen2.5-Coder is built upon the Qwen2.5 architecture and continues pretrained
on a vast corpus of over 5.5 trillion tokens. Through meticulous data cleaning,
scalable synthetic data generation, and balanced data mixing, Qwen2.5-Coder
demonstrates impressive code generation capabilities while retaining general
versatility. The model has been evaluated on a wide range of code-related
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across more than 10
benchmarks, including code generation, completion, reasoning, and repair,
consistently outperforming larger models of the same model size. We believe
that the release of the Qwen2.5-Coder series will not only push the boundaries
of research in code intelligence but also, through its permissive licensing,
encourage broader adoption by developers in real-world applications.

Santa-Maria, H. A. Smith, Y. Sofue, M. C. Sormani, V. Tolls, D. L. Walker, Q. D. Wang, G. M. Williams, F. -W. Xu |   The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our
local solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions
it exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong
dynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).
Consequently, it is likely that there are large-scale physical structures
within the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we
present new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a
multi-wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the
M0.8$-$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring-like morphology. We
estimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring to be 79\"
and 154\", respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre
distance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $> 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, a
mass of $\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\odot$, and an expansion speed of $\sim$ 20 km
s$^{-1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($> 10^{51}$ erg) and
momentum ($> 10^7$ M$_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$). We discuss several possible causes
for the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback
and large-scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the
M0.8$-$0.2 ring is a single high-energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain
the observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have
taken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which
we now see as the M0.8$-$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an
extreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.

| To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic
  reasoning | Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett |   Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of
tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted
a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own
evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives
strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with
much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the
answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the
question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic
operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of
CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing
against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic
execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our
results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance
while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond
prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation
across the whole range of LLM applications.

| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs | Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T. Chiu, Siyu Ren, Fei Yuan, Wenting Zhao, Zhiyong Wu, Alexander M. Rush |   Broad textual understanding and in-context learning require language models
that utilize full document contexts. Due to the implementation challenges
associated with directly training long-context models, many methods have been
proposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to
differences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these
approaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long-context
performance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a
controlled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation,
utilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several
insights into long-context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of
perplexity as a general-purpose performance indicator even in longer-context
tasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods
systematically underperform across long-context tasks. Finally, we confirm that
exact fine-tuning based methods are generally effective within the range of
their extension, whereas extrapolation remains challenging. All codebases,
models, and checkpoints will be made available open-source, promoting

| Finetuning Language Models to Emit Linguistic Expressions of Uncertainty | Arslan Chaudhry, Sridhar Thiagarajan, Dilan Gorur |   Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in information-seeking
and decision-making tasks. Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate
information that conflicts with real-world facts, and their persuasive style
can make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result,
end-users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with
the accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all
outputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore
supervised finetuning on uncertainty-augmented predictions as a method to
develop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty.
Specifically, we measure the calibration of pre-trained models and then
fine-tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of
uncertainty. Through experiments on various question-answering datasets, we
demonstrate that LLMs are well-calibrated in assessing their predictions, and
supervised finetuning based on the model's own confidence leads to
well-calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single-claim
answers.

| Computational Dynamical Systems | Jordan Cotler, Semon Rezchikov |   We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite-dimensional
dynamical systems. Building off of previous work, we give definitions for what
it means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine. We then
show that 'chaotic' dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and
'integrable' dynamical systems (more generally, measure-preserving systems)
cannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines can
be robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, we
show that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable
one-dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and
moreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt.
More broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one 'machine' to simulate
another, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low-complexity 'encoders' and
'decoders' to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system
being simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical
system leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity
theory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.

| Poisson approximate likelihood compared to the particle filter | Yize Hao, Aaron A. Abkemeier, Edward L. Ionides |   Filtering algorithms are fundamental for inference on partially observed
stochastic dynamic systems, since they provide access to the likelihood
function and hence enable likelihood-based or Bayesian inference. A novel
Poisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.
(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering
a fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of
partially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL
is the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large
improvement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,
based on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.
(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should
use PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence
also reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a
shortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that
the comparison of log-likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al. (2023) is
flawed because their PAL calculations were carried out using a dataset scaled
differently from the previous study. If PAL and the particle filter are applied
to the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears. On simulations
where the model is correctly specified, the particle filter outperforms PAL.

Furthermore, YORO excels in handling questions with challenging value

unique ergodicity on the IET, we can replace $f$ with any differentiable

| multiPI-TransBTS: A Multi-Path Learning Framework for Brain Tumor Image
  Segmentation Based on Multi-Physical Information | Hongjun Zhu, Jiaohang Huang, Kuo Chen, Xuehui Ying, Ying Qian |   Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis,
treatment planning, and monitoring the progression of brain tumors. However,
due to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across
different MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In
this study, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework, multiPI-TransBTS,
which integrates multi-physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.
The model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi-modal
imaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor
characteristics. The multiPI-TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an
Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi-source, multi-scale feature
decoder. The encoder incorporates a multi-branch architecture to separately
extract modality-specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module
fuses information from multiple sources using channel-wise and element-wise
attention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both
common and task-specific features through a Task-Specific Feature Introduction
(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),
Tumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on
the BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of
multiPI-TransBTS over the state-of-the-art methods. The model consistently
achieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,
highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results
also indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision
and recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a
significant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving
clinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.

  Modelling the multiwavelength observations in some Fermi/LAT bursts | Nissim Fraija, P. Veres, B. Betancourt Kamenetskaia, A. Galvan-Gamez, M. G. Dainotti, Simone Dichiara, R. L. Becerra |   Energetic GeV photons expected from the closest and the most energetic
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provide an unique opportunity to study the
very-high-energy emission as well as the possible correlations with lower
energy bands in realistic GRB afterglow models. In the standard GRB afterglow
model, the relativistic homogeneous shock is usually considered to be fully
adiabatic, however, it could be partially radiative. Based on the external
forward-shock scenario in both stellar wind and constant-density medium. We
present a radiative-adiabatic analytical model of the synchrotron self-Compton
(SSC) and synchrotron processes considering an electron energy distribution
with a power-law index of 1 < p < 2 and 2 $\leq$ p. We show that the SSC
scenario plays a relevant role in the radiative parameter $\epsilon$, leading
to a prolonged evolution during the slow cooling regime. In a particular case,
we derive the Fermi/LAT light curves together with the photons with energies
$\geq$ 100 MeV in a sample of nine bursts from the second Fermi/LAT GRB catalog
that exhibited temporal and spectral indices with $\geq$ 1.5 and $\approx$ 2,
respectively. These events can hardly be described with closure relations of
the standard synchrotron afterglow model, and also exhibit energetic photons
above the synchrotron limit. We have modeled the multi-wavelength observations
of our sample to constrain the microphysical parameters, the circumburst
density, the bulk Lorentz factor and the mechanism responsible for explaining
the energetic GeV photons.

| Blind Deconvolution on Graphs: Exact and Stable Recovery | Chang Ye, Gonzalo Mateos |   We study a blind deconvolution problem on graphs, which arises in the context
of localizing a few sources that diffuse over networks. While the observations
are bilinear functions of the unknown graph filter coefficients and sparse
input signals, a mild requirement on invertibility of the diffusion filter
enables an efficient convex relaxation leading to a linear programming
formulation that can be tackled with off-the-shelf solvers. Under the
Bernoulli-Gaussian model for the inputs, we derive sufficient exact recovery
conditions in the noise-free setting. A stable recovery result is then
established, ensuring the estimation error remains manageable even when the
observations are corrupted by a small amount of noise. Numerical tests with
synthetic and real-world network data illustrate the merits of the proposed
algorithm, its robustness to noise as well as the benefits of leveraging
multiple signals to aid the (blind) localization of sources of diffusion. At a
fundamental level, the results presented here broaden the scope of classical
blind deconvolution of (spatio-)temporal signals to irregular graph domains.

| Generalized compression and compressive search of large datasets | Morgan E. Prior, Thomas Howard III, Emily Light, Najib Ishaq, Noah M. Daniels |   The Big Data explosion has necessitated the development of search algorithms
that scale sub-linearly in time and memory.
  While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently,
few algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain-specific.
  We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to
perform $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search on compressed data while only decompressing
a small, relevant, portion of the data.
  panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low-dimensional
structure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.
  panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between
two points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in
terms of the other.
  This property holds for many widely-used distance functions, e.g. string edit
distances (Levenshtein, Needleman-Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures
(Jaccard, Dice, etc.).
  We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic,
and set data.
  We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the
compressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.
  panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering
sub-linear time performance for $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search.
  We conclude that panCAKES is an efficient, general-purpose algorithm for
exact compressive search on large datasets that obey the manifold hypothesis.
  We provide an open-source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming
language.

| WeHelp: A Shared Autonomy System for Wheelchair Users | Abulikemu Abuduweili, Alice Wu, Tianhao Wei, Weiye Zhao |   There is a large population of wheelchair users. Most of the wheelchair users
need help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs
are not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this
project, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair
users. A robot with a WeHelp system has three modes, following mode, remote
control mode and tele-operation mode. In the following mode, the robot follows
the wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can
ask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the
wheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech
recognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode.
In the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy
stick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs,
such as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high
shelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant
takes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks
for their needs. Our evaluation shows that the pipeline is useful and practical
for wheelchair users. Source code and demo of the paper are available at

| Identifying inflated Fermi surfaces via thermoelectric response in
  $d$-wave superconductor heterostructure | Amartya Pal, Paramita Dutta, Arijit Saha |   We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric response of inflated Fermi
surfaces (IFSs) generated in a two dimensional unconventional $d$-wave
superconductor subjected to an external in-plane Zeeman field. These IFSs
exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are
topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the
Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave
superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients
including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and
examine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage
and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of
$d$-wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the
normal-superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric
response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in
Seebeck coefficient ($\sim 200\,\mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($\sim 3.5$) due to the
generation of the IFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for
device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by
computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice-regularized
version of our continuum model.

| JEAN: Joint Expression and Audio-guided NeRF-based Talking Face
  Generation | Sai Tanmay Reddy Chakkera, Aggelina Chatziagapi, Dimitris Samaras |   We introduce a novel method for joint expression and audio-guided talking
face generation. Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker
identity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these
challenges, we propose a NeRF-based network. Since we train our network on
monocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn
disentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio
features in a self-supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects.
By incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned
audio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle
motion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer-based architecture
that learns expression features, capturing long-range facial expressions and
disentangling them from the speech-specific mouth movements. Through
quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-fidelity talking face videos, achieving state-of-the-art facial
expression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.

| Autopet III challenge: Incorporating anatomical knowledge into nnUNet
  for lesion segmentation in PET/CT | Hamza Kalisch, Fabian Hörst, Ken Herrmann, Jens Kleesiek, Constantin Seibold |   Lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging is essential for precise tumor
characterization, which supports personalized treatment planning and enhances
diagnostic precision in oncology. However, accurate manual segmentation of
lesions is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. Given the
rising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods,
particularly deep-learning-based approaches, have become increasingly more
relevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation
of tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting,
addressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable
solutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET
challenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers
(FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers. To this extent, we developed a
classifier that identifies the tracer of the given PET/CT based on the Maximum
Intensity Projection of the PET scan. We trained two individual
nnUNet-ensembles for each tracer where anatomical labels are included as a
multi-label task to enhance the model's performance. Our final submission
achieves cross-validation Dice scores of 76.90% and 61.33% for the publicly
available FDG and PSMA datasets, respectively. The code is available at

| Robots that Learn to Safely Influence via Prediction-Informed
  Reach-Avoid Dynamic Games | Ravi Pandya, Changliu Liu, Andrea Bajcsy |   Robots can influence people to accomplish their tasks more efficiently:
autonomous cars can inch forward at an intersection to pass through, and
tabletop manipulators can go for an object on the table first. However, a
robot's ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if
naively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach-avoid
dynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a
safety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human's behavior
as goal-driven but conditioned on the robot's plan, enabling us to capture
influence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical
and belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in
human behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE
(Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high-dimensional
(39-D) simulated human-robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline
game-theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust
baseline that treats the human as a worst-case adversary, a safety controller
that does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy-function-based
safety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage
the influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing
the robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate
during task execution.

| Decoding Style: Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Image-Guided Outfit
  Recommendation with Preference | Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan |   Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding
both fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper
presents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large
language models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their \"black box\" and static
nature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item
visual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style
and color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis
for personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the
open-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability
to recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative
examples is employed to enhance the LLM's decision-making process. This creates
a self-enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in
line with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore
dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill-in-the-blank,
and complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework's
ability to generate stylish, trend-aligned outfit suggestions, continuously
improving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our
proposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more
cohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the
proposed framework's potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate
suggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit
generation.

| Mechanical Wannier-Stark Ladder of Diamond Spin-Mechanical Lamb Wave
  Resonators | Philip Andrango, Hailin Wang |   We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier-Stark ladders of
diamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with
ultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin
properties. Three nearest-neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric
configurations and a large range of coupling rates have been explored for the
realization of Wannier-Stark ladders of LWRs, potentially enabling long-range
connectivity between spin qubits through their interactions with mechanical
vibrations. Additional analysis on the effects of disorder indicates that the
proposed Wannier-Stark ladder can be robust against realistic experimental
imperfections. The development of mechanical quantum networks of spin qubits
with long-range connectivity can open the door to the implementation of newly
developed quantum low-density parity-check codes in solid-state systems.

| MAgICoRe: Multi-Agent, Iterative, Coarse-to-Fine Refinement for
  Reasoning | Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Archiki Prasad, Swarnadeep Saha, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal |   Large Language Models' (LLM) reasoning can be improved using test-time
aggregation strategies, i.e., generating multiple samples and voting among
generated samples. While these improve performance, they often reach a
saturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated
feedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key
challenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can
over-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and
address errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to
identify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding
how many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too
soon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose
MAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty
as easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard
ones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error
localization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores.
Moreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with
three agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on
step-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure
sufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating
further rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5
and show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of
MAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by
4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with
baselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our
ablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe's RMs and multi-agent
communication.

| Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka |   Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string
processing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into
blocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence
of a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another
occurrence earlier in $T$. Due to numerous applications, LZ77 factorization is
one of the most studied problems on strings. In the 47 years since its
inception, several algorithms were developed for different models of
computation, including parallel, GPU, external-memory, and quantum. Remarkably,
however, the complexity of the most basic variant is still not settled: All
existing algorithms in the RAM model run in $\Omega(n)$ time, which is a
$\Theta(\log n)$ factor away from the lower bound of $\Omega(n/\log n)$
(following from the necessity to read the input, which takes $\Theta(n/\log n)$
space for $T\in\{0,1\}^{n}$).
  We present the first $o(n)$-time algorithm for LZ77 factorization, breaking
the linear-time barrier present for nearly 50 years. For $T\in\{0,1\}^{n}$, our
algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(n/\sqrt{\log n})=o(n)$ time and uses the optimal
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log n)$ working space. Our algorithm generalizes to
$\Sigma=[0..\sigma)$, where $\sigma=n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The runtime and
working space then become $\mathcal{O}((n\log\sigma)/\sqrt{\log n})$ and
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma} n)$. To obtain our algorithm, we prove a more
general result: For any constant $\epsilon\in(0,1)$ and $T\in[0..\sigma)^{n}$,
in $\mathcal{O}((n\log\sigma)/\sqrt{\log n})$ time and using
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma}n)$ space, we can construct an
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma}n)$-size index that, given any $P=T[j..j+\ell)$
(represented as $(j,\ell)$), computes the leftmost occurrence of $P$ in $T$ in
$\mathcal{O}(\log^{\epsilon}n)$ time. In other words, we solve the
indexing/online variant of the LZ77 problem.

| Experimental Evidence That Conversational Artificial Intelligence Can
  Steer Consumer Behavior Without Detection | Tobias Werner, Ivan Soraperra, Emilio Calvano, David C. Parkes, Iyad Rahwan |   Conversational AI models are becoming increasingly popular and are about to
replace traditional search engines for information retrieval and product
discovery. This raises concerns about monetization strategies and the potential
for subtle consumer manipulation. Companies may have financial incentives to
steer users toward search results or products in a conversation in ways that
are unnoticeable to consumers. Using a behavioral experiment, we show that
conversational AI models can indeed significantly shift consumer preferences.
We discuss implications and ask whether regulators are sufficiently prepared to
combat potential consumer deception.

Varriano |   Atomic masses are a foundational quantity in our understanding of nuclear
structure, astrophysics and fundamental symmetries. The long-standing goal of
creating a predictive global model for the binding energy of a nucleus remains
a significant challenge, however, and prompts the need for precise measurements
of atomic masses to serve as anchor points for model developments. We present
precise mass measurements of neutron-rich Ru and Pd isotopes performed at the
Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade facility at Argonne National
Laboratory using the Canadian Penning Trap mass spectrometer. The masses of
$^{108}$Ru, $^{110}$Ru and $^{116}$Pd were measured to a relative mass
precision $\delta m/m \approx 10^{-8}$ via the phase-imaging
ion-cyclotron-resonance technique, and represent an improvement of
approximately an order of magnitude over previous measurements. These mass data
were used in conjunction with the physically interpretable machine learning
(PIML) model, which uses a mixture density neural network to model mass
excesses via a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The effects of our new mass
data on a Bayesian-updating of a PIML model are presented.

generation strategy for text-based human motion generation. The method enhances
motion diffusion models by leveraging additional knowledge obtained through an
improved motion retrieval process. By effectively prompting large language

retrieval. Our approach utilizes a multi-part retrieval strategy to improve the
generalizability of motion retrieval across the language space. We create
diverse samples through the spatial composition of the retrieved motions.
Furthermore, by utilizing low-level, part-specific motion information, we can
construct motion samples for unseen text descriptions. Our experiments

personalized rapid customization has emerged as a significant trend. In this
report, we introduce Takin AudioLLM, a series of techniques and models, mainly
including Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, specifically designed for
audiobook production. These models are capable of zero-shot speech production,
generating high-quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human
speech and facilitating individuals to customize the speech content according
to their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec
language model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a
multi-task training framework, capable of generating high-fidelity natural
speech in a zero-shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and
timbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while
advocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its
naturalness and expressiveness. Last, we propose the Takin Morphing system with
highly decoupled and advanced timbre and prosody modeling approaches, which
enables individuals to customize speech production with their preferred timbre
and prosody in a precise and controllable manner. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness and robustness of our Takin AudioLLM series models.

to sparse computation through expert routing, selectively activating only a
small subset of expert modules. However, sparse computation challenges
traditional training practices, as discrete expert routing hinders standard
backpropagation and thus gradient-based optimization, which are the cornerstone
of deep learning. To better pursue the scaling power of MoE, we introduce GRIN
(GRadient-INformed MoE training), which incorporates sparse gradient estimation
for expert routing and configures model parallelism to avoid token dropping.
Applying GRIN to autoregressive language modeling, we develop a top-2
16$\times$3.8B MoE model. Our model, with only 6.6B activated parameters,
outperforms a 7B dense model and matches the performance of a 14B dense model
trained on the same data. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks
demonstrate the potential of GRIN to significantly enhance MoE efficacy,
achieving 79.4 on MMLU, 83.7 on HellaSwag, 74.4 on HumanEval, and 58.9 on MATH.

| BERT-VBD: Vietnamese Multi-Document Summarization Framework | Tuan-Cuong Vuong, Trang Mai Xuan, Thien Van Luong |   In tackling the challenge of Multi-Document Summarization (MDS), numerous
methods have been proposed, spanning both extractive and abstractive
summarization techniques. However, each approach has its own limitations,
making it less effective to rely solely on either one. An emerging and
promising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractive
summarization methods. Despite the plethora of studies in this domain, research
on the combined methodology remains scarce, particularly in the context of
Vietnamese language processing. This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDS
framework leveraging a two-component pipeline architecture that integrates
extractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs an
extractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This is
achieved by a modification of the pre-trained BERT network, which derives
semantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet network
structures. The second component utilizes the VBD-LLaMA2-7B-50b model for
abstractive summarization, ultimately generating the final summary document.
Our proposed framework demonstrates a positive performance, attaining ROUGE-2
scores of 39.6% on the VN-MDS dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art

| Einstein-dilaton-four-Maxwell Holographic Anisotropic Models | Irina Ya. Aref'eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov |   In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the
five-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell models has played a crucial role.
Typically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while
additional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A
more general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field
represents spatial longitudinal-transverse anisotropy, while the third and
fourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We
consider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero
temperature and five functions at non-zero temperature. Maxwell field related
to the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,
whereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.
We demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of
the seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations -- either the
dilaton or the vector potential equation -- follows from the Einstein equations
and the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi
identity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress-energy
tensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is
provided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to
three Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis
shows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein
equations and the equation for the vector potential

| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components
  for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco-Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram |   Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data
together with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal
components used. It is therefore important to determine the number of
significant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a
variational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for
estimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of
samples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This
eliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of
principal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.
This framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows
and columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),
and with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data
with arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as
cultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our
method on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may
underestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the
synthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical
dataset. These results suggest that it is broadly applicable across the life
sciences.

skills without relying on pre-existing language-specific knowledge. The test
covers 894 questions grouped in 160 problems across 75 (mostly) extremely
low-resource languages, extracted from the International Linguistic Olympiad

knowledge of the tested language, as all the information needed to solve the

originate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight
PBHs with masses $M\lesssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat
it via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate
whether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH
reheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the
initial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer
functions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and
isocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation
of state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH
dominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the
spectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive
to $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density
fluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance
as a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
observations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the
initial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we
find that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several
future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas,
especially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any
early matter-dominated universe scenario.

| Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules | Anqi Zhang, Wilson S. Geisler |   Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We
investigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented
displays having well-separated potential target-object locations. Performance
was compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption
that the information from the different potential target locations is
statistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than
optimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the
implausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show
that three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical
results. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near
optimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the
central potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise
causes search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These
findings have far-reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks
and other identification tasks in humans and other animals.

| Far-from-equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann
  approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows
  $v_n$ | Vincenzo Nugara, Vincenzo Greco, Salvatore Plumari |   We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal
system in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution
function and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system
sizes $R$ and interaction strength $\eta/s$ and identify universality classes
based upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each
of this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $\hat
\gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results
highlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum
moments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to
a 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of
different sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a
similar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse
flow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system
size and $\eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and
their response functions, along with the impact of the $\eta/s$ and the system
transverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in
momentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow
$v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of
large opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems
evolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play
in this process.

| Qwen2.5-Math Technical Report: Toward Mathematical Expert Model via
  Self-Improvement | An Yang, Beichen Zhang, Binyuan Hui, Bofei Gao, Bowen Yu, Chengpeng Li, Dayiheng Liu, Jianhong Tu, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin, Keming Lu, Mingfeng Xue, Runji Lin, Tianyu Liu, Xingzhang Ren, Zhenru Zhang |   In this report, we present a series of math-specific large language models:
Qwen2.5-Math and Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct-1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the
Qwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self-improvement
throughout the entire pipeline, from pre-training and post-training to
inference: (1) During the pre-training phase, Qwen2-Math-Instruct is utilized
to generate large-scale, high-quality mathematical data. (2) In the
post-training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive
sampling from Qwen2-Math-Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative
evolution of data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model,
it's possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the
next round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the
ultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct.
(3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling,
optimizing the model's performance.
  Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced
mathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics
datasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and
AIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math
competition problems.

| Computing the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two-Dimensional
  Strongly-Correlated Systems | Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn |   We show that the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time-reversal
invariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary-condition
dependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non-interacting and
strongly-correlated insulators. By introducing a family of quasi-single
particle states associated to the many-body ground state of an insulator, we
show that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant can be expressed as the integral of a
certain Berry connection over half the space of boundary conditions, providing
an alternative expression to the formulations that appear in [Lee et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. $\textbf{100}$, 186807 (2008)]. We show the equivalence of the
different many-body formulations of the invariant, and show how they reduce to
known band-theoretic results for Slater determinant ground states. Finally, we
apply our results to analytically calculate the invariant for the Kane-Mele
model with nonlocal (orbital) Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) interactions. This
rigorously establishes the topological nontriviality of the Kane-Mele model
with HK interactions, and represents one of the few exact calculations of the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a strongly-interacting system.

| Weak Lensing analysis of Abell 2390 using short exposures | A. Dutta, J. R. Peterson, T. Rose, M. Cianfaglione, A. Bonafede, G. Li, G. Sembroski |   We present a weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 2390 at z =
0.23 using second moment shape measurements made in 411 short 60s exposures.
The exposures are obtained in three broadband photometric filters (g, r, i)
using WIYN-ODI. Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a
moment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching
algorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The
measurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight
to obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim
simulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find
the mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We
also find the E-Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic
structures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical
and X-Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to
map large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of
the cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the
peaks are similar to X-Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster
and show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.

| Low Frame-rate Speech Codec: a Codec Designed for Fast High-quality
  Speech LLM Training and Inference | Edresson Casanova, Ryan Langman, Paarth Neekhara, Shehzeen Hussain, Jason Li, Subhankar Ghosh, Ante Jukić, Sang-gil Lee |   Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing
through audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the
application of language modeling techniques to audio data. However, audio
codecs often operate at high frame rates, resulting in slow training and
inference, especially for autoregressive models. To address this challenge, we
present the Low Frame-rate Speech Codec (LFSC): a neural audio codec that
leverages finite scalar quantization and adversarial training with large speech
language models to achieve high-quality audio compression with a 1.89 kbps
bitrate and 21.5 frames per second. We demonstrate that our novel codec can
make the inference of LLM-based text-to-speech models around three times faster
while improving intelligibility and producing quality comparable to previous
models.

| Stronger Baseline Models -- A Key Requirement for Aligning Machine
  Learning Research with Clinical Utility | Nathan Wolfrath, Joel Wolfrath, Hengrui Hu, Anjishnu Banerjee, Anai N. Kothari |   Machine Learning (ML) research has increased substantially in recent years,
due to the success of predictive modeling across diverse application domains.
However, well-known barriers exist when attempting to deploy ML models in
high-stakes, clinical settings, including lack of model transparency (or the
inability to audit the inference process), large training data requirements
with siloed data sources, and complicated metrics for measuring model utility.
In this work, we show empirically that including stronger baseline models in
healthcare ML evaluations has important downstream effects that aid
practitioners in addressing these challenges. Through a series of case studies,
we find that the common practice of omitting baselines or comparing against a
weak baseline model (e.g. a linear model with no optimization) obscures the
value of ML methods proposed in the research literature. Using these insights,
we propose some best practices that will enable practitioners to more
effectively study and deploy ML models in clinical settings.

| Revisiting Dark Photon Constraints from CMB Spectral Distortions | Jens Chluba, Bryce Cyr, Matthew C. Johnson |   Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide
stringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post-BBN (Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models
with COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.
Here, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark
photon conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous
works only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the
change to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon
distortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the
distortion has an opposite sign and a $\simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We
furthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover
the redshift range $\simeq 2\times 10^6-4\times 10^7$ between the $\mu$-era and
the end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints
for dark photon masses in the range $10^{-4}\,{\rm eV}\lesssim m_{\rm
dp}\lesssim 10^{-3}\,{\rm eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We
demonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon
to dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $\mu$-type distortion
independent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study
dark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with
CMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.

| Bi-objective trail-planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous
  environment | Cory M. Simon, Jeffrey Richley, Lucas Overbey, Darleen Perez-Lavin |   Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in
resource delivery, patrolling, information-gathering, agriculture, forest fire
fighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and
search-and-rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments -- with e.g.
rough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or
capturing robots -- should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of
risks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should
take the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the
team-level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward
from visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider
bi-objective trail-planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a
hazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed
graph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of
survival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a
robot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for
the Pareto-optimal robot-team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team
objectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive
the mission. A human decision-maker can then select trail plans that balance,
according to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony
optimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto-optimal set of
robot team trail plans. As a case study, we illustrate with an
information-gathering mission in an art museum.

| Pareto Data Framework: Steps Towards Resource-Efficient Decision Making
  Using Minimum Viable Data (MVD) | Tashfain Ahmed, Josh Siegel |   This paper introduces the Pareto Data Framework, an approach for identifying
and selecting the Minimum Viable Data (MVD) required for enabling machine
learning applications on constrained platforms such as embedded systems, mobile
devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We demonstrate that strategic
data reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing
bandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies
Minimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource-constrained
environments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient
practices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and
overprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for
optimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data
representation. An experimental methodology demonstrates effective acoustic
data characterization after downsampling, quantization, and truncation to
simulate reduced-fidelity sensors and network and storage constraints; results
shows that performance can be maintained up to 95\% with sample rates reduced
by 75\% and bit depths and clip length reduced by 50\% which translates into
substantial cost and resource reduction. These findings have implications on
the design and development of constrained systems. The paper also discusses
broader implications of the framework, including the potential to democratize
advanced AI technologies across IoT applications and sectors such as
agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing to improve access and multiply
the benefits of data-driven insights.

| Applications of Knowledge Distillation in Remote Sensing: A Survey | Yassine Himeur, Nour Aburaed, Omar Elharrouss, Iraklis Varlamis, Shadi Atalla, Wathiq Mansoor, Hussain Al Ahmad |   With the ever-growing complexity of models in the field of remote sensing
(RS), there is an increasing demand for solutions that balance model accuracy
with computational efficiency. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a
powerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,
complex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in
performance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and
its innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer
knowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact
and efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application
across various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and
historical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are
highlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational
efficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical
deployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of
KD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the
breadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case
studies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,
such as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review
discusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical
constraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive
overview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS. Through this
organization, the paper not only elucidates the current state of research in KD
but also sets the stage for future research opportunities, thereby contributing
significantly to both academic research and real-world applications.

| It depends: Varieties of defining growth dependence | Anja Janischewski, Katharina Bohnenberger, Matthias Kranke, Tobias Vogel, Riwan Driouich, Tobias Froese, Stefanie Gerold, Raphael Kaufmann, Lorenz Keyßer, Jannis Niethammer, Christopher Olk, Matthias Schmelzer, Aslı Yürük, Steffen Lange |   Many socio-economic systems require positive economic growth rates to
function properly. Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing
evidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,
these growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,
more and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth-dependent systems
and develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of
'growth dependence' still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,
which impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article
proposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the
concept of 'growth dependence' across socio-economic systems. We provide a
general definition consisting of four components that can be specified for
different empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of
measurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions
or properties of the system under investigation. According to our general
definition, a socio-economic system is growth-dependent if it requires a
long-term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to
maintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen
normative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to
three areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:
employment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies
demonstrate that whether or not a system is growth-dependent hinges not only on
the empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of
the concept of growth dependence. Our framework enables coherent, robust and
effective definitions and research questions, fostering comparability of
findings across different cases and disciplines.

| SPRMamba: Surgical Phase Recognition for Endoscopic Submucosal
  Dissection with Mamba | Xiangning Zhang, Jinnan Chen, Qingwei Zhang, Chengfeng Zhou, Zhengjie Zhang, Xiaobo Li, Dahong Qian |   Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive procedure
initially designed for the treatment of early gastric cancer but is now widely
used for various gastrointestinal lesions. Computer-assisted Surgery systems
have played a crucial role in improving the precision and safety of ESD
procedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognition
of surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesion
characteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real-time
surgical phase recognition algorithms. Existing surgical phase recognition
algorithms struggle to efficiently capture temporal contexts in video-based
scenarios, leading to insufficient performance. To address these issues, we
propose SPRMamba, a novel Mamba-based framework for ESD surgical phase
recognition. SPRMamba leverages the strengths of Mamba for long-term temporal
modeling while introducing the Scaled Residual TranMamba block to enhance the
capture of fine-grained details, overcoming the limitations of traditional
temporal models like Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformers.
Moreover, a Temporal Sample Strategy is introduced to accelerate the
processing, which is essential for real-time phase recognition in clinical
settings. Extensive testing on the ESD385 dataset and the cholecystectomy
Cholec80 dataset demonstrates that SPRMamba surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits greater robustness across various surgical phase
recognition tasks.

| Measuring Human and AI Values based on Generative Psychometrics with
  Large Language Models | Haoran Ye, Yuhang Xie, Yuanyi Ren, Hanjun Fang, Xin Zhang, Guojie Song |   Human values and their measurement are long-standing interdisciplinary
inquiry. Recent advances in AI have sparked renewed interest in this area, with
large language models (LLMs) emerging as both tools and subjects of value
measurement. This work introduces Generative Psychometrics for Values (GPV), an
LLM-based, data-driven value measurement paradigm, theoretically grounded in
text-revealed selective perceptions. We begin by fine-tuning an LLM for
accurate perception-level value measurement and verifying the capability of
LLMs to parse texts into perceptions, forming the core of the GPV pipeline.
Applying GPV to human-authored blogs, we demonstrate its stability, validity,
and superiority over prior psychological tools. Then, extending GPV to LLM
value measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometric
methodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free-form
outputs, enabling context-specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis of
measurement paradigms, indicating response biases of prior methods; and 3) an
attempt to bridge LLM values and their safety, revealing the predictive power
of different value systems and the impacts of various values on LLM safety.
Through interdisciplinary efforts, we aim to leverage AI for next-generation
psychometrics and psychometrics for value-aligned AI.

| FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated
  Long-Tailed Learning | Xiuhua Lu, Peng Li, Xuefeng Jiang |   Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy
in distributed machine learning. However, datasets distributed across each
client in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can
be globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly
affects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated
learning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it
fails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data.
This results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting
the equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a
methodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,
we propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the
local training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred
optimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state-of-the-art
methods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed
distribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10-LT and
CIFAR-100-LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of
model performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long-tailed
distribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.

| Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error
  Detection | Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia |   Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications. Doing
so requires overcoming the noise present on today's hardware. The quantum
approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling
up due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup
over state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems. However,
achieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require
fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant
implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection
code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the
algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with
up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we
propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance, and use it
to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance
to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our
model can be used to determine necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform
Goemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware. Our results demonstrate the
largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially
fault-tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date,
paving the way towards solving real-world applications with quantum computers.

| Cyclicity Analysis of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process | Vivek Kaushik |   In this thesis, we consider an $N$-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)
process satisfying the linear stochastic differential equation $d\mathbf x(t) =
- \mathbf B\mathbf x(t) dt + \boldsymbol \Sigma d \mathbf w(t).$ Here, $\mathbf
B$ is a fixed $N \times N$ circulant friction matrix whose eigenvalues have
positive real parts, $\boldsymbol \Sigma$ is a fixed $N \times M$ matrix. We
consider a signal propagation model governed by this OU process. In this model,
an underlying signal propagates throughout a network consisting of $N$ linked
sensors located in space. We interpret the $n$-th component of the OU process
as the measurement of the propagating effect made by the $n$-th sensor. The
matrix $\mathbf B$ represents the sensor network structure: if $\mathbf B$ has
first row $(b_1 \ , \ \dots \ , \ b_N),$ where $b_1>0$ and $b_2 \ , \ \dots \
,\ b_N \le 0,$ then the magnitude of $b_p$ quantifies how receptive the $n$-th
sensor is to activity within the $(n+p-1)$-th sensor. Finally, the $(m,n)$-th
entry of the matrix $\mathbf D = \frac{\boldsymbol \Sigma \boldsymbol
\Sigma^\text T}{2}$ is the covariance of the component noises injected into the
$m$-th and $n$-th sensors. For different choices of $\mathbf B$ and
$\boldsymbol \Sigma,$ we investigate whether Cyclicity Analysis enables us to
recover the structure of network. Roughly speaking, Cyclicity Analysis studies
the lead-lag dynamics pertaining to the components of a multivariate signal. We
specifically consider an $N \times N$ skew-symmetric matrix $\mathbf Q,$ known
as the lead matrix, in which the sign of its $(m,n)$-th entry captures the
lead-lag relationship between the $m$-th and $n$-th component OU processes. We
investigate whether the structure of the leading eigenvector of $\mathbf Q,$
the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of $\mathbf Q$ in
modulus, reflects the network structure induced by $\mathbf B.$

Our contributions include the design of symmetry-enriched learning models, the
development of advanced optimization techniques leveraging categorical

| Brain-Streams: fMRI-to-Image Reconstruction with Multi-modal Guidance | Jaehoon Joo, Taejin Jeong, Seongjae Hwang |   Understanding how humans process visual information is one of the crucial
steps for unraveling the underlying mechanism of brain activity. Recently, this
curiosity has motivated the fMRI-to-image reconstruction task; given the fMRI
data from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual
stimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent
Diffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex
visual stimuli such as high-resolution natural images from vision datasets.
Despite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often
lack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.
Consequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere
visuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs
effectively incorporate multi-modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,
and image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image
generations. Specifically, inspired by the two-streams hypothesis suggesting
that perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain
regions, our framework, Brain-Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain
regions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from
semantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information
regions, Brain-Streams provides accurate multi-modal guidance to LDMs. We
validate the reconstruction ability of Brain-Streams both quantitatively and
qualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI
data.

| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal
  execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huyên Pham |   Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and
constraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity
markets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general
propagator model under linear functional inequality constraints. The optimal
control is given explicitly in terms of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers
and their conditional expectations, as a solution to a linear stochastic
Fredholm equation. We propose a stochastic version of the Uzawa algorithm on
the dual problem to construct the stochastic Lagrange multipliers numerically
via a stochastic projected gradient ascent, combined with a least-squares Monte
Carlo regression step to approximate their conditional expectations. We
illustrate our findings on two different practical applications with stochastic
signals: (i) an optimal execution problem with an exponential or a power law
decaying transient impact, with either a `no-shorting' constraint in the
presence of a `sell' signal, a `no-buying' constraint in the presence of a
`buy' signal or a stochastic `stop-trading' constraint whenever the exogenous
price drops below a specified reference level; (ii) a battery storage problem
with instantaneous operating costs, seasonal signals and fixed constraints on
both the charging power and the load capacity of the battery.

latter are used as backbone for a custom transformer architecture that aims to

that this approach effectively captures skill matching similarity and

| An Efficient Projection-Based Next-best-view Planning Framework for
  Reconstruction of Unknown Objects | Zhizhou Jia, Shaohui Zhang, Qun Hao |   Efficiently and completely capturing the three-dimensional data of an object
is a fundamental problem in industrial and robotic applications. The task of
next-best-view (NBV) planning is to infer the pose of the next viewpoint based
on the current data, and gradually realize the complete three-dimensional
reconstruction. Many existing algorithms, however, suffer a large computational
burden due to the use of ray-casting. To address this, this paper proposes a
projection-based NBV planning framework. It can select the next best view at an
extremely fast speed while ensuring the complete scanning of the object.
Specifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into
ellipsoids based on the voxel structure.Then, the next best view is selected
from the candidate views using a projection-based viewpoint quality evaluation
function in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy. This process
replaces the ray-casting in voxel structures, significantly improving the
computational efficiency. Comparative experiments with other algorithms in a
simulation environment show that the framework proposed in this paper can
achieve 10 times efficiency improvement on the basis of capturing roughly the
same coverage. The real-world experimental results also prove the efficiency
and feasibility of the framework.

| Undersampling effects on observed periods of coronal oscillations | Daye Lim, Tom Van Doorsselaere, Valery M. Nakariakov, Dmitrii Y. Kolotkov, Yuhang Gao, David Berghmans |   Context. Recent observations of decayless transverse oscillations have shown
two branches in the relationship between periods and loop lengths. One is a
linear relationship, interpreted as a standing mode. The other shows almost no
correlation and has not yet been interpreted conclusively. Aims. We
investigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless
oscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely
follow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations
are standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations
where the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase
are randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal
by considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of
telescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast
Fourier transform. Results. When the sampling cadence is getting closer to the
actual oscillation period, a tendency for overestimating periods in short loops
is enhanced. The relationship between loop lengths and periods of the sampled
signals shows the two branches as in the observation. Conclusions. We find that
long periods of decayless oscillations occurring in short loops could be the
result of undersampling.

| Enwrapped Perylene Bisimide Enables Room Temperature Polariton Lasing
  and Photonic Lattices | Dominik Horneber, Johannes Düreth, Tim Schembri, Simon Betzold, Matthias Stolte, Sven Höfling, Frank Würthner, Sebastian Klembt |   Perylene bisimides (PBIs) are organic dyes with photoluminescence quantum
yields (PLQY) close to unity in solution and great thermal and photo-chemical
stability. These features alongside the tunability of their solid-state packing
arrangement via chemical functionalization make this material class an
excellent candidate for exciton-polariton lasing at room temperature. Polariton
lasing is well understood in III-V semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures,
however, the search for emitter materials for robust and versatile room
temperature applications is ongoing. While e.g. perovskites and several organic
materials have been identified to support polariton lasing, many of these
materials lack tunability and long-term stability under ambient conditions.
Here, we fabricate optical microcavities using a strongly enwrapped PBI
chromophore with prevailing monomer-like absorption and emission properties in
the solid state. Voluminous bay-substituents prevent stacking induced
PLQY-quenching, thereby enabling polariton lasing at room temperature.
Additionally, photonic confinement in single hemispheric resonators is
demonstrated leading to localized polaritonic modes with discrete energies, as
well as optical lattices revealing distinct polaritonic band-structures. Due to
the possibility of tunable properties by the precise control of the solid-state
packing arrangement of PBI emitters, our results pave the way for
polarization-dependent light-matter coupling, including topological photonic
effects within oriented crystalline thin-film microcavity structures.

| IMRL: Integrating Visual, Physical, Temporal, and Geometric
  Representations for Enhanced Food Acquisition | Rui Liu, Zahiruddin Mahammad, Amisha Bhaskar, Pratap Tokekar |   Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality
of life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse
food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents
unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric
information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g.,
color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially
when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance.
We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition.
Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy
based on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, such
representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse
acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which
integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance
the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach
captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular,
liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and
introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and
assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies
based on context, improving the robot's capability to handle diverse food
acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach's
robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations,
including zero-shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves
improvement up to $35\%$ in success rate compared with the best-performing
baseline.

| Uncovering liquid-substrate fluctuation effects on crystal growth and
  disordered hyperuniformity of two-dimensional materials | S. K. Mkhonta, Zhi-Feng Huang, K. R. Elder |   We investigate the growth of two-dimensional (2D) crystals on fluctuating
surfaces using a phase field crystal model that is relevant on atomic length
and diffusive time scales. Motivated by recent experiments which achieved
unprecedented fast growth of large-size high-quality 2D crystals on liquid
substrates, we uncover novel effects of liquid surfaces on microstructural
ordering. We find that substrate fluctuations generate short-ranged noise that
speeds up crystallization and grain growth of the overlayer, surpassing that of
free-standing system. Coupling to the liquid substrate fluctuations can also
modulate local randomness, leading to intriguing disordered structures with
hidden spatial order, i.e., disordered hyperuniformity. These results reveal
the physical mechanisms underlying the fast growth of 2D crystals on liquid
surfaces and demonstrate a novel strategy for synthesizing disordered
hyperuniform thin film structures.

| The Impact of Element Ordering on LM Agent Performance | Wayne Chi, Ameet Talwalkar, Chris Donahue |   There has been a surge of interest in language model agents that can navigate
virtual environments such as the web or desktop. To navigate such environments,
agents benefit from information on the various elements (e.g., buttons, text,
or images) present. It remains unclear which element attributes have the
greatest impact on agent performance, especially in environments that only
provide a graphical representation (i.e., pixels). Here we find that the
ordering in which elements are presented to the language model is surprisingly
impactful--randomizing element ordering in a webpage degrades agent performance
comparably to removing all visible text from an agent's state representation.
While a webpage provides a hierarchical ordering of elements, there is no such
ordering when parsing elements directly from pixels. Moreover, as tasks become
more challenging and models more sophisticated, our experiments suggest that
the impact of ordering increases. Finding an effective ordering is non-trivial.
We investigate the impact of various element ordering methods in web and
desktop environments. We find that dimensionality reduction provides a viable
ordering for pixel-only environments. We train a UI element detection model to
derive elements from pixels and apply our findings to an agent
benchmark--OmniACT--where we only have access to pixels. Our method completes
more than two times as many tasks on average relative to the previous
state-of-the-art.

| Quark saturation in the QCD phase diagram | Marcus Bluhm, Yuki Fujimoto, Larry McLerran, Marlene Nahrgang |   We determine the onset of Quarkyonic Matter corresponding to values of
temperature and baryon chemical potential at which the quark phase space
density becomes one. At zero temperature for baryon chemical potentials below
the mass of the Lambda baryon, only nucleons contribute to the quark density.
This is different at finite temperature, where all baryons, mesons and their
resonances can be excited and thus add quarks to the phase space. The
probability density to find a quark inside a hadron is determined using the
Yukawa ansatz of the IdylliQ model of Quarkyonic Matter. We estimate separately
the magnitude of the various contributions of nucleons, Delta baryons, pions as
well as further hadrons and resonances. The uncertainty in the parametrization
of the probability density to find a quark inside a nucleon is spanned by
assuming that at zero temperature the transition density to Quarkyonic Matter
is between one and three times that of nuclear matter. Various predictions for
a possible critical point associated with the chiral phase transition are found
close to a triple point at which the line of the deconfinement transition and
the curve associated with the transition to Quarkyonic Matter intersect. These
considerations provide an estimate for the region in the QCD phase diagram
where Quarkyonic Matter may be found.

combined with advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, to
predict the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to End-Stage Renal
Disease (ESRD). We analyze a comprehensive, 10-year dataset provided by a major
health insurance organization to develop prediction models for multiple
observation windows using traditional machine learning methods such as Random

Memory (LSTM) networks. Our findings demonstrate that the LSTM model,
particularly with a 24-month observation window, exhibits superior performance
in predicting ESRD progression, outperforming existing models in the
literature. We further apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to
enhance interpretability, providing insights into the impact of individual
features on predictions at the individual patient level. This study underscores
the value of leveraging administrative claims data for CKD management and
predicting ESRD progression.

at the LHC. Over the past decade, numerous endeavours have been undertaken in
the literature to develop methods for efficiently distinguishing boosted top
quark jets from QCD jets. Although cut-based strategies for boosted top
tagging, which rely on substructure information from fat jets resulting from
the hadronic decay of boosted top quarks, were introduced in the literature as

machine learning-based approaches for the classification of top-jets from QCD
jets. The review focuses on the present status of boosted top tagging and its

distribution amplitude of the $\eta_c$-meson from Lattice QCD at leading twist.
We employ a set of CLS $N_f=2$ ensembles at three lattice spacings and various
quark masses to extrapolate the pseudo distribution to the physical point in
the isospin limit. We solve the inverse problem modeling the distribution
amplitude, and we match our results to the light-cone in the
$\overline{\text{MS}}$-scheme. We include a complete error budget, and we
compare to two alternative approaches: non-relativistic QCD and Dyson-Schwinger
equations, finding good agreement with the latter but not with the former.

&u_{t}=\nabla\cdot\big(u^{m-1}v\nabla v\big)-\nabla\cdot\big(f(u)v\nabla

no-flux boundary conditions in a smoothly bounded convex domain $\Omega\subset
\R^2$, where the nonnegative function $f\in C^1([0,\infty))$ is asked to
satisfy $f(s)\le C_fs^{\al}$ with $\al, C_f>0$ for all $s\ge 1$.
  The global existence of weak solutions or classical solutions to the above
system has been established in both one- and two-dimensional bounded convex
domains in previous works. However, the results concerning the large time
behavior are still constrained to one dimension due to the lack of a
Harnack-type inequality in the two-dimensional case. In this note, we
complement this result by using the Moser iteration technique and building a
new Harnack-type inequality.

| ReLU Surrogates in Mixed-Integer MPC for Irrigation Scheduling | Bernard T. Agyeman, Jinfeng Liu, Sirish L. Shah |   Efficient water management in agriculture is important for mitigating the
growing freshwater scarcity crisis. Mixed-integer Model Predictive Control
(MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex
scheduling problems in agricultural irrigation. However, the computational
complexity of mixed-integer MPC still poses a significant challenge,
particularly in large-scale applications. This study proposes an approach to
enhance the computational efficiency of mixed-integer MPC-based irrigation
schedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture
dynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed-integer linear
representation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the
mixed-integer MPC-based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a
mixed-integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed-integer
nonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global
optimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated
through comparative studies conducted on a large-scale agricultural field
across two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models,
specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used
triggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU-based approach significantly
reduces solution times -- by up to 99.5\% -- while achieving comparable
performance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water
Use Efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, the ReLU-based approach maintains enhanced
performance in terms of total prescribed irrigation and IWUE compared to the
widely-used triggered irrigation scheduling method.

| Design of Ligand-Binding Proteins with Atomic Flow Matching | Junqi Liu, Shaoning Li, Chence Shi, Zhi Yang, Jian Tang |   Designing novel proteins that bind to small molecules is a long-standing
challenge in computational biology, with applications in developing catalysts,
biosensors, and more. Current computational methods rely on the assumption that
the binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible,
as conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon
binding. In this work, we formulate proteins and molecules as unified
biotokens, and present AtomFlow, a novel deep generative model under the
flow-matching framework for the design of ligand-binding proteins from the 2D
target molecular graph alone. Operating on representative atoms of biotokens,
AtomFlow captures the flexibility of ligands and generates ligand conformations
and protein backbone structures iteratively. We consider the multi-scale nature
of biotokens and demonstrate that AtomFlow can be effectively trained on a
subset of structures from the Protein Data Bank, by matching flow vector field
using an SE(3) equivariant structure prediction network. Experimental results
show that our method can generate high fidelity ligand-binding proteins and
achieve performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model RFDiffusionAA,
while not requiring bound ligand structures. As a general framework, AtomFlow
holds the potential to be applied to various biomolecule generation tasks in
the future.

| Denoising diffusion models for high-resolution microscopy image
  restoration | Pamela Osuna-Vargas, Maren H. Wehrheim, Lucas Zinz, Johanna Rahm, Ashwin Balakrishnan, Alexandra Kaminer, Mike Heilemann, Matthias Kaschube |   Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at
the nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological
organization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of
fluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses
remain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced
laser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and
increased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high-resolution
images by conditioning the model on low-resolution information. Additionally,
the probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images
that tend to further increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We show that our model
achieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously
best-performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly,
while any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but
not all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all
four data sets, suggesting high generalizability.

| Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Via Data Pruning | Andrea Napoli, Paul White |   The removal of carefully-selected examples from training data has recently
emerged as an effective way of improving the robustness of machine learning
models. However, the best way to select these examples remains an open
question. In this paper, we consider the problem from the perspective of
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). We propose AdaPrune, a method for UDA
whereby training examples are removed to attempt to align the training
distribution to that of the target data. By adopting the maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) as the criterion for alignment, the problem can be neatly
formulated and solved as an integer quadratic program. We evaluate our approach
on a real-world domain shift task of bioacoustic event detection. As a method
for UDA, we show that AdaPrune outperforms related techniques, and is
complementary to other UDA algorithms such as CORAL. Our analysis of the
relationship between the MMD and model accuracy, along with t-SNE plots,
validate the proposed method as a principled and well-founded way of performing
data pruning.

| The elastica sling | Alessandro Cazzolli, Francesco Dal Corso |   The nonlinear mechanics of a flexible elastic rod constrained at its edges by
a pair of sliding sleeves is analyzed. The planar equilibrium configurations of
this variable-length elastica are found to have shape defined only by the
inclination of the two constraints, while their distance is responsible only
for scaling the size. By extending the theoretical stability criterion
available for systems under isoperimetric constraints to the case of variable
domains, the existence of no more than one stable equilibrium solution is
revealed. The set of sliding sleeves' inclination pairs for which the stability
is lost are identified. Such critical conditions allow the indefinite ejection
of the flexible rod from the sliding sleeves, thus realizing an elastica sling.
Finally, the theoretical findings are validated by experiments on a physical
prototype. The present results lead to a novel actuation principle that may
find application as a mechanism in energy harvesting, wave mitigation devices,
and soft robotic locomotion.

| Online Refractive Camera Model Calibration in Visual Inertial Odometry | Mohit Singh, Kostas Alexis |   This paper presents a general refractive camera model and online
co-estimation of odometry and the refractive index of unknown media. This
enables operation in diverse and varying refractive fluids, given only the
camera calibration in air. The refractive index is estimated online as a state
variable of a monocular visual-inertial odometry framework in an iterative
formulation using the proposed camera model. The method was verified on data
collected using an underwater robot traversing inside a pool. The evaluations
demonstrate convergence to the ideal refractive index for water despite
significant perturbations in the initialization. Simultaneously, the approach
enables on-par visual-inertial odometry performance in refractive media without
prior knowledge of the refractive index or requirement of medium-specific

| Influence of dislocations in multilayer graphene stacks: A phase field
  crystal study | K. R. Elder, Zhi-Feng Huang, T. Ala-Nissila |   In this work the influence of $5|7$ dislocations in multiplayer graphene
stacks (up to six layers) is examined. The study is conducted through a
recently developed Phase Field Crystal (PFC) model for multilayer systems
incorporating out-of-plane deformations and parameterized to match to density
functional theory calculations for graphene bilayers and other systems. The
specific configuration considered consists of one monolayer containing four
$5|7$ dislocations (i.e., two dislocation dipoles) sandwiched in between
perfect graphene layers. The study reveals how the strain field from the
dislocations in the defected layer leads to out-of-plane deformations that in
turn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are
made for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a
defect-free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and
system size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by
roughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence
across the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height
profiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.

| PAD-FT: A Lightweight Defense for Backdoor Attacks via Data Purification
  and Fine-Tuning | Yukai Xu, Yujie Gu, Kouichi Sakurai |   Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks,
particularly as recent advancements have led to increasingly subtle
implantation, making the defense more challenging. Existing defense mechanisms
typically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and
involve retraining an auxiliary model or fine-tuning the entire victim model.
However, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always
feasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and
lightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD-FT, that does not require an
additional clean dataset and fine-tunes only a very small part of the model to
disinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a
simple data purification process to identify and select the most-likely clean
data from the poisoned training dataset. The self-purified clean dataset is
then used for activation clipping and fine-tuning only the last classification
layer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation
clipping, and classifier fine-tuning, our mechanism PAD-FT demonstrates
superior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as
confirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.

| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing
  data in Irish sagas | P. MacCarron |   For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts
in order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify
similarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the
significance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture

often impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the
network of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that
the top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent
with central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has
been lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust
to a large random removal of edges.

we prove a structure theorem for $16/7$-power-free ternary rich words. Using
the structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich
words is $1 + 1/(3 - \mu) \approx 2.25876324$, where $\mu$ is the unique real

| Fitting Multilevel Factor Models | Tetiana Parshakova, Trevor Hastie, Stephen Boyd |   We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance
given by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~\cite{parshakova2023factor}. We
develop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of
the observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and
maintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved
through a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive
definite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of an invertible PSD MLR matrix
is also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the
recursive Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of
the inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky
factorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities,
yielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement. This paper is
accompanied by an open-source package that implements the proposed methods.

| Drifts of the sub-stellar points of the TRAPPIST-1 planets | Revol Alexandre, Émeline Bolmont, Mariana Sastre, Gabriel Tobie, Anne-Sophie Libert, Mathilde Kervazo, Sergi Blanco-Cuaresma |   Accurate modeling of tidal interactions is crucial for interpreting recent
JWST observations of the thermal emissions of TRAPPIST-1~b and c and for
characterizing the surface conditions and potential habitability of the other
planets in the system. Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by
tidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to
their proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the
TRAPPIST-1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In
this work, we present the recent implementation of the co-planar tidal torque
and forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N-body code
Posidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using
a tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of
each planet by taking into account their multi-layer internal structure
computed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets
are not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state.
Planet-planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and
tides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a
result, the sub-stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and
long-timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with
periods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.

| Quantum Magic and Multi-Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei | Florian Brökemeier, S. Momme Hengstenberg, James W. T. Keeble, Caroline E. P. Robin, Federico Rocco, Martin J. Savage |   Motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the
quantum complexity of $p$-shell and $sd$-shell nuclei. Valence-space nuclear
shell-model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit
registers using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$-shell and 24
qubits for the $sd$-shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement
($n$-tangles) and magic (non-stabilizerness) are determined. While exact
evaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of
active nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex
nuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique
is introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed
nuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\sim 8$ for some
nuclei. Significant multi-nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$-shell,
dominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of
magic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on
the path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion.
These results indicate that quantum-computing resources will accelerate
precision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.

| Post-Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a
  massive, rotating object | Lorenzo Iorio |   The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the
general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring
components of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are
analytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level. To the Newtonian
order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as
well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation
in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the
primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first
to 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system
along an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred
close to the Sun's flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due
to the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of
microarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for
the post-Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)
spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of
the latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current
(formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would
bring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the
predicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not
changed by any of the post--Keplerian accelerations considered. The
calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any
alternative models of gravity as well.

generalizability. However, it remains notoriously costly, both in terms of
hardware and data collection, and deploying it in real-world environments
demands meticulous setup of robots and precise experimental conditions. In this
paper, we present a low-cost robot learning framework that is both easily
reproducible and transferable to various robots and environments. We
demonstrate that deployable imitation learning can be successfully applied even
to industrial-grade robots, not just expensive collaborative robotic arms.
Furthermore, our results show that multi-task robot learning is achievable with
simple network architectures and fewer demonstrations than previously thought
necessary. As the current evaluating method is almost subjective when it comes
to real-world manipulation tasks, we propose Voting Positive Rate (VPR) - a
novel evaluation strategy that provides a more objective assessment of
performance. We conduct an extensive comparison of success rates across various
self-designed tasks to validate our approach. To foster collaboration and
support the robot learning community, we have open-sourced all relevant
datasets and model checkpoints, available at huggingface.co/ZhiChengAI.

| PARAPHRASUS : A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Paraphrase
  Detection Models | Andrianos Michail, Simon Clematide, Juri Opitz |   The task of determining whether two texts are paraphrases has long been a
challenge in NLP. However, the prevailing notion of paraphrase is often quite
simplistic, offering only a limited view of the vast spectrum of paraphrase
phenomena. Indeed, we find that evaluating models in a paraphrase dataset can
leave uncertainty about their true semantic understanding. To alleviate this,
we release paraphrasus, a benchmark designed for multi-dimensional assessment
of paraphrase detection models and finer model selection. We find that
paraphrase detection models under a fine-grained evaluation lens exhibit
trade-offs that cannot be captured through a single classification dataset.

| Dual-Layer Training and Decoding of Large Language Model with
  Simultaneously Thinking and Speaking | Ningyuan Xi, Xiaoyu Wang, Yetao Wu, Teng Chen, Qingqing Gu, Jinxian Qu, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong Chen, Luo Ji |   Large Language Model can reasonably understand and generate human expressions
but may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have
been several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but
most of them are not data-driven or training-based. In this paper, we are
motivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel
model architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts
and then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines
to annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt-response samples, then
add language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We
train the language model by the thoughts-augmented data and successfully let
the thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally
output more reasonable responses. Both qualitative examples and quantitative
results validate the effectiveness and performance of TaS. Our code is
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TadE.

| Cartan moving frames and the data manifolds | Eliot Tron, Rita Fioresi, Nicolas Couellan, Stéphane Puechmorel |   The purpose of this paper is to employ the language of Cartan moving frames
to study the geometry of the data manifolds and its Riemannian structure, via
the data information metric and its curvature at data points. Using this
framework and through experiments, explanations on the response of a neural
network are given by pointing out the output classes that are easily reachable
from a given input. This emphasizes how the proposed mathematical relationship
between the output of the network and the geometry of its inputs can be
exploited as an explainable artificial intelligence tool.

| Artemis: Efficient Commit-and-Prove SNARKs for zkML | Hidde Lycklama, Alexander Viand, Nikolay Avramov, Nicolas Küchler, Anwar Hithnawi |   The widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) in various critical
applications, from healthcare to autonomous systems, has raised significant
concerns about privacy, accountability, and trustworthiness. To address these
concerns, recent research has focused on developing zero-knowledge machine
learning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of
ML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have
substantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily
optimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the
substantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the
model and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new
Commit-and-Prove SNARK (CP-SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that
effectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML
pipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white-box use of the
underlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic
polynomial commitment and only makes black-box use of the proof system. As a
result, Artemis is compatible with state-of-the-art proof systems without
trusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP-SNARKs, evaluate
their performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial
improvements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover
costs and maintaining efficiency even for large-scale models. For example, for
the VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from
11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML
towards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and
complex ML models.

| MMP for Enriques pairs and singular Enriques varieties | Francesco Antonio Denisi, Ángel David Ríos Ortiz, Nikolaos Tsakanikas, Zhixin Xie |   We introduce and study the class of primitive Enriques varieties, whose
smooth members are Enriques manifolds. We provide several examples and we
demonstrate that this class is stable under the operations of the Minimal Model
Program (MMP). In particular, given an Enriques manifold $Y$ and an effective
$\mathbb{R}$-divisor $B_Y$ on $Y$ such that the pair $(Y,B_Y)$ is log
canonical, we prove that any $(K_Y+B_Y)$-MMP terminates with a minimal model
$(Y',B_{Y'})$ of $(Y,B_Y)$, where $Y'$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial primitive
Enriques variety with canonical singularities. Finally, we investigate the
asymptotic theory of Enriques manifolds.

| Numerical renormalization group calculations for magnetic impurity
  systems with spin-orbit coupling and crystal-field effects | Aitor Calvo-Fernández, María Blanco-Rey, Asier Eiguren |   Exploiting symmetries in the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method
significantly enhances performance by improving accuracy, increasing
computational speed, and optimizing memory efficiency. Published codes focus on
continuous rotations and unitary groups, which generally are not applicable to
systems with strong crystal-field effects. The PointGroupNRG code implements
symmetries related to discrete rotation groups, which are defined by the user
in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, together with particle conservation
and spin rotation symmetries. In this paper we present a new version of the
code that extends the available finite groups, previously limited to simply
reducible point groups, in a way that all point and double groups become
accessible. It also includes the full spin-orbital rotation group. Moreover, to
improve the code's flexibility for impurities with complex interactions, this
new version allows to choose between a standard Anderson Hamiltonian for the
impurity or, as another novel feature, an ionic model that requires only the
spectrum and the impurity Lehmann amplitudes.

| Quantum-like nonlinear interferometry with frequency-engineered
  classical light | Romain Dalidet, Anthony Martin, Grégory Sauder, Laurent Labonté, Sébastien Tanzilli |   Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic
entanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits. Nonlinear
optics has served as a workhorse for the generation of entangled photon pairs,
ensuring both energy and phase conservation, but at the cost of limited rate
and degraded signal-to-noise ratio compared to laser-based interferometry
approaches. We present a \"quantum-like\" nonlinear optical method that reaches
super-resolution in single-photon detection regime. This is achieved by
replacing photon-pairs by coherent states of light, mimicking quantum
properties through classical nonlinear optics processes. Our scheme utilizes
two high-brightness lasers. This results in a substantially greater
signal-to-noise ratio compared to its quantum counterpart. Such an approach
paves the way to significantly reduced acquisition times, providing a pathway
to explore signals across a broader range of bandwidth. The need to increase
the frequency bandwidth of the quantum sensor significantly motivates the
potential applications of this pathway.

| A Survey-Based Quantitative Analysis of Stress Factors and Their Impacts
  Among Cybersecurity Professionals | Sunil Arora, John D. Hastings |   This study investigates the prevalence and underlying causes of work-related
stress and burnout among cybersecurity professionals using a quantitative
survey approach guided by the Job Demands-Resources model. Analysis of
responses from 50 cybersecurity practitioners reveals an alarming reality: 44%
report experiencing severe work-related stress and burnout, while an additional
28% are uncertain about their condition. The demanding nature of cybersecurity
roles, unrealistic expectations, and unsupportive organizational cultures
emerge as primary factors fueling this crisis. Notably, 66% of respondents
perceive cybersecurity jobs as more stressful than other IT positions, with 84%
facing additional challenges due to the pandemic and recent high-profile
breaches. The study finds that most cybersecurity experts are reluctant to
report their struggles to management, perpetuating a cycle of silence and
neglect. To address this critical issue, the paper recommends that
organizations foster supportive work environments, implement mindfulness
programs, and address systemic challenges. By prioritizing the mental health of
cybersecurity professionals, organizations can cultivate a more resilient and
effective workforce to protect against an ever-evolving threat landscape.

clinical trial data. Creation of TFLs for reporting activities is often a

the generation of TFLs through prompt engineering and few-shot transfer

demonstrated that LLMs can efficiently generate TFLs with prompt instructions,
showcasing their potential in this domain. Furthermore, we developed a
conservational agent named Clinical Trial TFL Generation Agent: An app that
matches user queries to predefined prompts that produce customized programs to
generate specific predefined TFLs.

| Handling Long-Term Safety and Uncertainty in Safe Reinforcement Learning | Jonas Günster, Puze Liu, Jan Peters, Davide Tateo |   Safety is one of the key issues preventing the deployment of reinforcement
learning techniques in real-world robots. While most approaches in the Safe
Reinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and
robot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them
in complex real-world settings. Instead, model-based approaches that
incorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning
framework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on
the real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot
dynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task-specific and hard
to obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to
compute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long-term safety
requirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe
exploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus
on ensuring long-term safety and handling of uncertainty. Our approach is
competitive or superior to state-of-the-art methods in final performance while
maintaining safer behavior during training.

| Quasiperiodic Floquet-Gibbs states in Rydberg atomic systems | Wilson S. Martins, Federico Carollo, Kay Brandner, Igor Lesanovsky |   Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by
fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an
equilibrium-like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet-Magnus
Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi's golden rule, we show
that such Floquet-Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated
Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab-frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function
of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the
system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which
is necessary to uphold high-lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To
corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five
interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate
numerically that the second-order Floquet-Gibbs state of this system is
essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding
Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently
large.

| Understanding the Effects of the Baidu-ULTR Logging Policy on Two-Tower
  Models | Morris de Haan, Philipp Hager |   Despite the popularity of the two-tower model for unbiased learning to rank
(ULTR) tasks, recent work suggests that it suffers from a major limitation that
could lead to its collapse in industry applications: the problem of logging
policy confounding. Several potential solutions have even been proposed;
however, the evaluation of these methods was mostly conducted using
semi-synthetic simulation experiments. This paper bridges the gap between
theory and practice by investigating the confounding problem on the largest
real-world dataset, Baidu-ULTR. Our main contributions are threefold: 1) we
show that the conditions for the confounding problem are given on Baidu-ULTR,
2) the confounding problem bears no significant effect on the two-tower model,
and 3) we point to a potential mismatch between expert annotations, the golden
standard in ULTR, and user click behavior.

| ASR Benchmarking: Need for a More Representative Conversational Dataset | Gaurav Maheshwari, Dmitry Ivanov, Théo Johannet, Kevin El Haddad |   Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable
performance on widely used benchmarks such as LibriSpeech and Fleurs. However,
these benchmarks do not adequately reflect the complexities of real-world

disfluencies such as pauses, interruptions, and diverse accents. In this study,
we introduce a multilingual conversational dataset, derived from TalkBank,
consisting of unstructured phone conversation between adults. Our results show
a significant performance drop across various state-of-the-art ASR models when
tested in conversational settings. Furthermore, we observe a correlation
between Word Error Rate and the presence of speech disfluencies, highlighting
the critical need for more realistic, conversational ASR benchmarks.

| DynaMo: In-Domain Dynamics Pretraining for Visuo-Motor Control | Zichen Jeff Cui, Hengkai Pan, Aadhithya Iyer, Siddhant Haldar, Lerrel Pinto |   Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex
visuomotor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to
thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual
observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual
representations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or
trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present
DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual
representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a
latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of
image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without
augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions.
Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet
datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real
environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly
improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised
learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo
hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP,
and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and
measure its impact on downstream policy performance. Robot videos are best

models that redefines the conventional predetermined-resolution approach in
visual processing. Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism,
which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions
into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to
generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning
with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary
Position Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional
information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for
processing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception
capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL
investigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By
scaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the
amount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive
performance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to
leading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal
benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models. Code is available at

| Bundle Adjustment in the Eager Mode | Zitong Zhan, Huan Xu, Zihang Fang, Xinpeng Wei, Yaoyu Hu, Chen Wang |   Bundle adjustment (BA) is a critical technique in various robotic
applications, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), augmented
reality (AR), and photogrammetry. BA optimizes parameters such as camera poses
and 3D landmarks to align them with observations. With the growing importance
of deep learning in perception systems, there is an increasing need to
integrate BA with deep learning frameworks for enhanced reliability and
performance. However, widely-used C++-based BA frameworks, such as GTSAM,
g$^2$o, and Ceres, lack native integration with modern deep learning libraries
like PyTorch. This limitation affects their flexibility, adaptability, ease of
debugging, and overall implementation efficiency. To address this gap, we
introduce an eager-mode BA framework seamlessly integrated with PyPose,
providing PyTorch-compatible interfaces with high efficiency. Our approach
includes GPU-accelerated, differentiable, and sparse operations designed for
2nd-order optimization, Lie group and Lie algebra operations, and linear
solvers. Our eager-mode BA on GPU demonstrates substantial runtime efficiency,
achieving an average speedup of 18.5$\times$, 22$\times$, and 23$\times$
compared to GTSAM, g$^2$o, and Ceres, respectively.

| Massively Multi-Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context | Felix B Mueller, Julian Tanke, Juergen Gall |   Forecasting long-term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of
human behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input
sequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby
people can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene-aware social
transformer model (SAST) to forecast long-term (10s) human motion motion.
Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely
varying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal
convolutional encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer-based bottleneck
that allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model
the conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We
benchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to
16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously. Our model
outperforms other approaches in terms of realism and diversity on different
metrics and in a user study. Code is available at

| SPECTER: An Instrument Concept for CMB Spectral Distortion Measurements
  with Enhanced Sensitivity | Alina Sabyr, Carlos Sierra, J. Colin Hill, Jeffrey J. McMahon |   Deviations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum from a
perfect blackbody uniquely probe a wide range of physics, ranging from
fundamental physics in the primordial Universe ($\mu$-distortion) to late-time
baryonic feedback processes (y-distortion). While the y-distortion can be
detected with a moderate increase in sensitivity over that of COBE/FIRAS, the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion is roughly two orders of magnitude
smaller and requires substantial improvements, with foregrounds presenting a
serious obstacle. Within the standard model, the dominant contribution to $\mu$
arises from energy injected via Silk damping, yielding sensitivity to the
primordial power spectrum at wavenumbers $k \approx 1-10^{4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Here,
we present a new instrument concept, SPECTER, with the goal of robustly
detecting $\mu$. The instrument technology is similar to that of LiteBIRD, but
with an absolute temperature calibration system. Using a Fisher approach, we
optimize the instrument's configuration to target $\mu$ while robustly
marginalizing over foreground contaminants. Unlike
Fourier-transform-spectrometer-based designs, the specific bands and their
individual sensitivities can be independently set in this instrument, allowing
significant flexibility. We forecast SPECTER to observe the
$\Lambda$CDM-predicted $\mu$-distortion at $\approx 5\sigma$ (10$\sigma$)
assuming an observation time of 1 (4) year(s) (corresponding to mission
duration of 2 (8) years), after foreground marginalization. Our optimized
configuration includes 16 bands spanning 1-2000 GHz with degree-scale angular
resolution at 150 GHz and 1046 total detectors. SPECTER will additionally
measure the y-distortion at sub-percent precision and its relativistic
correction at percent-level precision, yielding tight constraints on the total
thermal energy and mean temperature of ionized gas.

Ringqvist, Dorian Demars, Markus Janson, Mickaël Bonnefoy, Yuhiko Aoyama, Gabriel-Dominique Marleau, Catherine Dougados, Judit Szulágyi, Thanawuth Thanathibodee |   Accretion among planets is a poorly understood phenomenon, due to lack of
both observational and theoretical studies. Detection of emission lines from
accreting gas giants facilitate detailed investigations into this process. This
work presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known
young, planetary-mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf
2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7-21 Mj and age 5-45 Myr, located at 45+-2
pc. We obtained the first high-resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target
with VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near-UV to visible wavelengths (3200-6800
AA). We report resolved H3-H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum.
Based on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+-1
km/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR
excess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of
the parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+-63 K and radius to 1.5+-0.1
Rj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet-surface shock model
implies a pre-shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,-40) km/s and a pre-shock
density of log(n0/cm^-3)=14(+0,-5). Pre-shock velocity points to a mass of
6(+8,-4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary
Lline-Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of
1.4(+2.8,-0.9)x10^-8 Mj/yr.

from its predecessor, CodeQwen1.5. This series includes two models:
Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B. As a code-specific model,
Qwen2.5-Coder is built upon the Qwen2.5 architecture and continues pretrained
on a vast corpus of over 5.5 trillion tokens. Through meticulous data cleaning,
scalable synthetic data generation, and balanced data mixing, Qwen2.5-Coder
demonstrates impressive code generation capabilities while retaining general
versatility. The model has been evaluated on a wide range of code-related
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across more than 10
benchmarks, including code generation, completion, reasoning, and repair,
consistently outperforming larger models of the same model size. We believe
that the release of the Qwen2.5-Coder series will not only push the boundaries
of research in code intelligence but also, through its permissive licensing,
encourage broader adoption by developers in real-world applications.

Santa-Maria, H. A. Smith, Y. Sofue, M. C. Sormani, V. Tolls, D. L. Walker, Q. D. Wang, G. M. Williams, F. -W. Xu |   The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our
local solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions
it exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong
dynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar).
Consequently, it is likely that there are large-scale physical structures
within the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we
present new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a
multi-wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the
M0.8$-$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring-like morphology. We
estimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring to be 79\"
and 154\", respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre
distance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $> 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, a
mass of $\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\odot$, and an expansion speed of $\sim$ 20 km
s$^{-1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($> 10^{51}$ erg) and
momentum ($> 10^7$ M$_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$). We discuss several possible causes
for the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback
and large-scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the
M0.8$-$0.2 ring is a single high-energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain
the observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have
taken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which
we now see as the M0.8$-$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an
extreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.

strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with
much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the
answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the
question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic
operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of
CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing
against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic
execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our
results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance
while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond
prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation
across the whole range of LLM applications.

| A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs | Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T. Chiu, Siyu Ren, Fei Yuan, Wenting Zhao, Zhiyong Wu, Alexander M. Rush |   Broad textual understanding and in-context learning require language models
that utilize full document contexts. Due to the implementation challenges
associated with directly training long-context models, many methods have been
proposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to
differences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these
approaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long-context
performance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a
controlled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation,
utilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several
insights into long-context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of
perplexity as a general-purpose performance indicator even in longer-context
tasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods
systematically underperform across long-context tasks. Finally, we confirm that
exact fine-tuning based methods are generally effective within the range of
their extension, whereas extrapolation remains challenging. All codebases,
models, and checkpoints will be made available open-source, promoting
transparency and facilitating further research in this critical area of AI
development.

| Finetuning Language Models to Emit Linguistic Expressions of Uncertainty | Arslan Chaudhry, Sridhar Thiagarajan, Dilan Gorur |   Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in information-seeking
and decision-making tasks. Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate
information that conflicts with real-world facts, and their persuasive style
can make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result,
end-users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with
the accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all
outputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore
supervised finetuning on uncertainty-augmented predictions as a method to
develop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty.
Specifically, we measure the calibration of pre-trained models and then
fine-tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of
uncertainty. Through experiments on various question-answering datasets, we
demonstrate that LLMs are well-calibrated in assessing their predictions, and
supervised finetuning based on the model's own confidence leads to
well-calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single-claim
answers.

| Computational Dynamical Systems | Jordan Cotler, Semon Rezchikov |   We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite-dimensional
dynamical systems. Building off of previous work, we give definitions for what
it means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine. We then
show that 'chaotic' dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and
'integrable' dynamical systems (more generally, measure-preserving systems)
cannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines can
be robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, we
show that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable
one-dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and
moreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt.
More broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one 'machine' to simulate
another, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low-complexity 'encoders' and
'decoders' to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system
being simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical
system leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity
theory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.

| Poisson approximate likelihood compared to the particle filter | Yize Hao, Aaron A. Abkemeier, Edward L. Ionides |   Filtering algorithms are fundamental for inference on partially observed
stochastic dynamic systems, since they provide access to the likelihood
function and hence enable likelihood-based or Bayesian inference. A novel
Poisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.
(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering
a fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of
partially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL
is the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large
improvement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,
based on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.
(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should
use PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence
also reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a
shortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that
the comparison of log-likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al. (2023) is
flawed because their PAL calculations were carried out using a dataset scaled
differently from the previous study. If PAL and the particle filter are applied
to the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears. On simulations
where the model is correctly specified, the particle filter outperforms PAL.

| You Only Read Once (YORO): Learning to Internalize Database Knowledge
  for Text-to-SQL | Hideo Kobayashi, Wuwei Lan, Peng Shi, Shuaichen Chang, Jiang Guo, Henghui Zhu, Zhiguo Wang, Patrick Ng |   While significant progress has been made on the text-to-SQL task, recent
solutions repeatedly encode the same database schema for every question,
resulting in unnecessary high inference cost and often overlooking crucial
database knowledge. To address these issues, we propose You Only Read Once
(YORO), a novel paradigm that directly internalizes database knowledge into the
parametric knowledge of a text-to-SQL model during training and eliminates the
need for schema encoding during inference. YORO significantly reduces the input
token length by 66%-98%. Despite its shorter inputs, our empirical results
demonstrate YORO's competitive performances with traditional systems on three
benchmarks as well as its significant outperformance on large databases.
Furthermore, YORO excels in handling questions with challenging value
retrievals such as abbreviation.

| Ergodic properties of infinite extension of symmetric interval exchange
  transformations | Przemysław Berk, Frank Trujillo, Hao Wu |   We prove that skew products with the cocycle given by the function
$f(x)=a(x-1/2)$ with $a\neq 0$ are ergodic for every ergodic symmetric IET in
the base, thus giving the full characterization of ergodic extensions in this
family. Moreover, we prove that under an additional natural assumption of
unique ergodicity on the IET, we can replace $f$ with any differentiable
function with a non-zero sum of jumps. Finally, by considering weakly mixing
IETs instead of just ergodic, we show that the skew products with cocycle given
by $f$ have infinite ergodic index.

| multiPI-TransBTS: A Multi-Path Learning Framework for Brain Tumor Image
  Segmentation Based on Multi-Physical Information | Hongjun Zhu, Jiaohang Huang, Kuo Chen, Xuehui Ying, Ying Qian |   Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis,
treatment planning, and monitoring the progression of brain tumors. However,
due to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across
different MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In
this study, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework, multiPI-TransBTS,
which integrates multi-physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy.
The model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi-modal
imaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor
characteristics. The multiPI-TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an
Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi-source, multi-scale feature
decoder. The encoder incorporates a multi-branch architecture to separately
extract modality-specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module
fuses information from multiple sources using channel-wise and element-wise
attention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both
common and task-specific features through a Task-Specific Feature Introduction
(TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT),
Tumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on
the BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of
multiPI-TransBTS over the state-of-the-art methods. The model consistently
achieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores,
highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results
also indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision
and recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a
significant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving
clinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.

| Synchrotron self-Compton in a radiative-adiabatic fireball scenario:
  Modelling the multiwavelength observations in some Fermi/LAT bursts | Nissim Fraija, P. Veres, B. Betancourt Kamenetskaia, A. Galvan-Gamez, M. G. Dainotti, Simone Dichiara, R. L. Becerra |   Energetic GeV photons expected from the closest and the most energetic
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provide an unique opportunity to study the
very-high-energy emission as well as the possible correlations with lower
energy bands in realistic GRB afterglow models. In the standard GRB afterglow
model, the relativistic homogeneous shock is usually considered to be fully
adiabatic, however, it could be partially radiative. Based on the external
forward-shock scenario in both stellar wind and constant-density medium. We
present a radiative-adiabatic analytical model of the synchrotron self-Compton
(SSC) and synchrotron processes considering an electron energy distribution
with a power-law index of 1 < p < 2 and 2 $\leq$ p. We show that the SSC
scenario plays a relevant role in the radiative parameter $\epsilon$, leading
to a prolonged evolution during the slow cooling regime. In a particular case,
we derive the Fermi/LAT light curves together with the photons with energies
$\geq$ 100 MeV in a sample of nine bursts from the second Fermi/LAT GRB catalog
that exhibited temporal and spectral indices with $\geq$ 1.5 and $\approx$ 2,
respectively. These events can hardly be described with closure relations of
the standard synchrotron afterglow model, and also exhibit energetic photons
above the synchrotron limit. We have modeled the multi-wavelength observations
of our sample to constrain the microphysical parameters, the circumburst
density, the bulk Lorentz factor and the mechanism responsible for explaining
the energetic GeV photons.

| Blind Deconvolution on Graphs: Exact and Stable Recovery | Chang Ye, Gonzalo Mateos |   We study a blind deconvolution problem on graphs, which arises in the context
of localizing a few sources that diffuse over networks. While the observations
are bilinear functions of the unknown graph filter coefficients and sparse
input signals, a mild requirement on invertibility of the diffusion filter
enables an efficient convex relaxation leading to a linear programming
formulation that can be tackled with off-the-shelf solvers. Under the
Bernoulli-Gaussian model for the inputs, we derive sufficient exact recovery
conditions in the noise-free setting. A stable recovery result is then
established, ensuring the estimation error remains manageable even when the
observations are corrupted by a small amount of noise. Numerical tests with
synthetic and real-world network data illustrate the merits of the proposed
algorithm, its robustness to noise as well as the benefits of leveraging
multiple signals to aid the (blind) localization of sources of diffusion. At a
fundamental level, the results presented here broaden the scope of classical
blind deconvolution of (spatio-)temporal signals to irregular graph domains.

| Generalized compression and compressive search of large datasets | Morgan E. Prior, Thomas Howard III, Emily Light, Najib Ishaq, Noah M. Daniels |   The Big Data explosion has necessitated the development of search algorithms
that scale sub-linearly in time and memory.
  While compression algorithms and search algorithms do exist independently,
few algorithms offer both, and those which do are domain-specific.
  We present panCAKES, a novel approach to compressive search, i.e., a way to
perform $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search on compressed data while only decompressing
a small, relevant, portion of the data.
  panCAKES assumes the manifold hypothesis and leverages the low-dimensional
structure of the data to compress and search it efficiently.
  panCAKES is generic over any distance function for which the distance between
two points is proportional to the memory cost of storing an encoding of one in
terms of the other.
  This property holds for many widely-used distance functions, e.g. string edit
distances (Levenshtein, Needleman-Wunsch, etc.) and set dissimilarity measures
(Jaccard, Dice, etc.).
  We benchmark panCAKES on a variety of datasets, including genomic, proteomic,
and set data.
  We compare compression ratios to gzip, and search performance between the
compressed and uncompressed versions of the same dataset.
  panCAKES achieves compression ratios close to those of gzip, while offering
sub-linear time performance for $k$-NN and $\rho$-NN search.
  We conclude that panCAKES is an efficient, general-purpose algorithm for
exact compressive search on large datasets that obey the manifold hypothesis.
  We provide an open-source implementation of panCAKES in the Rust programming
language.

| WeHelp: A Shared Autonomy System for Wheelchair Users | Abulikemu Abuduweili, Alice Wu, Tianhao Wei, Weiye Zhao |   There is a large population of wheelchair users. Most of the wheelchair users
need help with daily tasks. However, according to recent reports, their needs
are not properly satisfied due to the lack of caregivers. Therefore, in this
project, we develop WeHelp, a shared autonomy system aimed for wheelchair
users. A robot with a WeHelp system has three modes, following mode, remote
control mode and tele-operation mode. In the following mode, the robot follows
the wheelchair user automatically via visual tracking. The wheelchair user can
ask the robot to follow them from behind, by the left or by the right. When the
wheelchair user asks for help, the robot will recognize the command via speech
recognition, and then switch to the teleoperation mode or remote control mode.
In the teleoperation mode, the wheelchair user takes over the robot with a joy
stick and controls the robot to complete some complex tasks for their needs,
such as opening doors, moving obstacles on the way, reaching objects on a high
shelf or on the low ground, etc. In the remote control mode, a remote assistant
takes over the robot and helps the wheelchair user complete some complex tasks
for their needs. Our evaluation shows that the pipeline is useful and practical
for wheelchair users. Source code and demo of the paper are available at

| Identifying inflated Fermi surfaces via thermoelectric response in
  $d$-wave superconductor heterostructure | Amartya Pal, Paramita Dutta, Arijit Saha |   We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric response of inflated Fermi
surfaces (IFSs) generated in a two dimensional unconventional $d$-wave
superconductor subjected to an external in-plane Zeeman field. These IFSs
exhibiting the same dimension as the underlying normal state Fermi surface are
topologically protected by combinations of discrete symmetries. Utilizing the
Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism and considering normal-$d$-wave
superconductor hybrid junction, we compute the thermoelectric coefficients
including thermal conductance, Seebeck coefficient, figure of merit ($zT$), and
examine the validation of Widemann-Franz law in the presence of both voltage
and temperature bias. Importantly, as a signature of anisotropic nature of
$d$-wave pairing, Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed at the
normal-superconductor interface play a significant role in the thermoelectric
response. In the presence of ABSs, we observe a substantial enhancement in
Seebeck coefficient ($\sim 200\,\mu$V/K) and $zT$ ($\sim 3.5$) due to the
generation of the IFSs and thus making such setup a potential candidate for
device applications. Finally, we strengthen our continuum model results by
computing the thermoelectric coefficients based on a lattice-regularized
version of our continuum model.

| JEAN: Joint Expression and Audio-guided NeRF-based Talking Face
  Generation | Sai Tanmay Reddy Chakkera, Aggelina Chatziagapi, Dimitris Samaras |   We introduce a novel method for joint expression and audio-guided talking
face generation. Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker
identity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these
challenges, we propose a NeRF-based network. Since we train our network on
monocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn
disentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio
features in a self-supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects.
By incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned
audio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle
motion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer-based architecture
that learns expression features, capturing long-range facial expressions and
disentangling them from the speech-specific mouth movements. Through
quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-fidelity talking face videos, achieving state-of-the-art facial
expression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.

| Autopet III challenge: Incorporating anatomical knowledge into nnUNet
  for lesion segmentation in PET/CT | Hamza Kalisch, Fabian Hörst, Ken Herrmann, Jens Kleesiek, Constantin Seibold |   Lesion segmentation in PET/CT imaging is essential for precise tumor
characterization, which supports personalized treatment planning and enhances
diagnostic precision in oncology. However, accurate manual segmentation of
lesions is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. Given the
rising demand and clinical use of PET/CT, automated segmentation methods,
particularly deep-learning-based approaches, have become increasingly more
relevant. The autoPET III Challenge focuses on advancing automated segmentation
of tumor lesions in PET/CT images in a multitracer multicenter setting,
addressing the clinical need for quantitative, robust, and generalizable
solutions. Building on previous challenges, the third iteration of the autoPET
challenge introduces a more diverse dataset featuring two different tracers
(FDG and PSMA) from two clinical centers. To this extent, we developed a
classifier that identifies the tracer of the given PET/CT based on the Maximum
Intensity Projection of the PET scan. We trained two individual
nnUNet-ensembles for each tracer where anatomical labels are included as a
multi-label task to enhance the model's performance. Our final submission
achieves cross-validation Dice scores of 76.90% and 61.33% for the publicly
available FDG and PSMA datasets, respectively. The code is available at

| Robots that Learn to Safely Influence via Prediction-Informed
  Reach-Avoid Dynamic Games | Ravi Pandya, Changliu Liu, Andrea Bajcsy |   Robots can influence people to accomplish their tasks more efficiently:
autonomous cars can inch forward at an intersection to pass through, and
tabletop manipulators can go for an object on the table first. However, a
robot's ability to influence can also compromise the safety of nearby people if
naively executed. In this work, we pose and solve a novel robust reach-avoid
dynamic game which enables robots to be maximally influential, but only when a
safety backup control exists. On the human side, we model the human's behavior
as goal-driven but conditioned on the robot's plan, enabling us to capture
influence. On the robot side, we solve the dynamic game in the joint physical
and belief space, enabling the robot to reason about how its uncertainty in
human behavior will evolve over time. We instantiate our method, called SLIDE
(Safely Leveraging Influence in Dynamic Environments), in a high-dimensional
(39-D) simulated human-robot collaborative manipulation task solved via offline
game-theoretic reinforcement learning. We compare our approach to a robust
baseline that treats the human as a worst-case adversary, a safety controller
that does not explicitly reason about influence, and an energy-function-based
safety shield. We find that SLIDE consistently enables the robot to leverage
the influence it has on the human when it is safe to do so, ultimately allowing
the robot to be less conservative while still ensuring a high safety rate
during task execution.

| Decoding Style: Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Image-Guided Outfit
  Recommendation with Preference | Najmeh Forouzandehmehr, Nima Farrokhsiar, Ramin Giahi, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan |   Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding
both fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper
presents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large
language models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their \"black box\" and static
nature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item
visual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style
and color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis
for personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the
open-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability
to recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative
examples is employed to enhance the LLM's decision-making process. This creates
a self-enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in
line with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore
dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill-in-the-blank,
and complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework's
ability to generate stylish, trend-aligned outfit suggestions, continuously
improving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our
proposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more
cohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the
proposed framework's potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate
suggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit
generation.

  Resonators | Philip Andrango, Hailin Wang |   We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier-Stark ladders of
diamond Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) that can feature compression modes with
ultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin
properties. Three nearest-neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric
configurations and a large range of coupling rates have been explored for the
realization of Wannier-Stark ladders of LWRs, potentially enabling long-range
connectivity between spin qubits through their interactions with mechanical
vibrations. Additional analysis on the effects of disorder indicates that the
proposed Wannier-Stark ladder can be robust against realistic experimental
imperfections. The development of mechanical quantum networks of spin qubits
with long-range connectivity can open the door to the implementation of newly

| MAgICoRe: Multi-Agent, Iterative, Coarse-to-Fine Refinement for
  Reasoning | Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Archiki Prasad, Swarnadeep Saha, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal |   Large Language Models' (LLM) reasoning can be improved using test-time
aggregation strategies, i.e., generating multiple samples and voting among
generated samples. While these improve performance, they often reach a
saturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated
feedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key
challenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can
over-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and
address errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to
identify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding
how many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too
soon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose
MAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty
as easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard
ones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error
localization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores.
Moreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with
three agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on
step-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure
sufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating
further rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5
and show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of
MAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by
4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with
baselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our
ablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe's RMs and multi-agent
communication.

| Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) Factorization in Sublinear Time | Dominik Kempa, Tomasz Kociumaka |   Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) factorization is a fundamental problem in string
processing: Greedily partition a given string $T$ from left to right into
blocks (called phrases) so that each phrase is either the leftmost occurrence
of a letter or the longest prefix of the unprocessed suffix that has another
occurrence earlier in $T$. Due to numerous applications, LZ77 factorization is
one of the most studied problems on strings. In the 47 years since its
inception, several algorithms were developed for different models of
computation, including parallel, GPU, external-memory, and quantum. Remarkably,
however, the complexity of the most basic variant is still not settled: All
existing algorithms in the RAM model run in $\Omega(n)$ time, which is a
$\Theta(\log n)$ factor away from the lower bound of $\Omega(n/\log n)$
(following from the necessity to read the input, which takes $\Theta(n/\log n)$
space for $T\in\{0,1\}^{n}$).
  We present the first $o(n)$-time algorithm for LZ77 factorization, breaking
the linear-time barrier present for nearly 50 years. For $T\in\{0,1\}^{n}$, our
algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(n/\sqrt{\log n})=o(n)$ time and uses the optimal
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log n)$ working space. Our algorithm generalizes to
$\Sigma=[0..\sigma)$, where $\sigma=n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The runtime and
working space then become $\mathcal{O}((n\log\sigma)/\sqrt{\log n})$ and
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma} n)$. To obtain our algorithm, we prove a more
general result: For any constant $\epsilon\in(0,1)$ and $T\in[0..\sigma)^{n}$,
in $\mathcal{O}((n\log\sigma)/\sqrt{\log n})$ time and using
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma}n)$ space, we can construct an
$\mathcal{O}(n/\log_{\sigma}n)$-size index that, given any $P=T[j..j+\ell)$
(represented as $(j,\ell)$), computes the leftmost occurrence of $P$ in $T$ in
$\mathcal{O}(\log^{\epsilon}n)$ time. In other words, we solve the
indexing/online variant of the LZ77 problem.

are unnoticeable to consumers. Using a behavioral experiment, we show that
conversational AI models can indeed significantly shift consumer preferences.
We discuss implications and ask whether regulators are sufficiently prepared to

creating a predictive global model for the binding energy of a nucleus remains
a significant challenge, however, and prompts the need for precise measurements
of atomic masses to serve as anchor points for model developments. We present
precise mass measurements of neutron-rich Ru and Pd isotopes performed at the
Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade facility at Argonne National

$^{108}$Ru, $^{110}$Ru and $^{116}$Pd were measured to a relative mass
precision $\delta m/m \approx 10^{-8}$ via the phase-imaging
ion-cyclotron-resonance technique, and represent an improvement of
approximately an order of magnitude over previous measurements. These mass data
were used in conjunction with the physically interpretable machine learning

excesses via a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The effects of our new mass

motion diffusion models by leveraging additional knowledge obtained through an

Furthermore, by utilizing low-level, part-specific motion information, we can
construct motion samples for unseen text descriptions. Our experiments

| Takin: A Cohort of Superior Quality Zero-shot Speech Generation Models |  EverestAI,  :, Sijin Chen, Yuan Feng, Laipeng He, Tianwei He, Wendi He, Yanni Hu, Bin Lin, Yiting Lin, Pengfei Tan, Chengwei Tian, Chen Wang, Zhicheng Wang, Ruoye Xie, Jingjing Yin, Jianhao Ye, Jixun Yao, Quanlei Yan, Yuguang Yang |   With the advent of the big data and large language model era, zero-shot
personalized rapid customization has emerged as a significant trend. In this
report, we introduce Takin AudioLLM, a series of techniques and models, mainly
including Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, specifically designed for
audiobook production. These models are capable of zero-shot speech production,
generating high-quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human
speech and facilitating individuals to customize the speech content according
to their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec
language model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a
multi-task training framework, capable of generating high-fidelity natural
speech in a zero-shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and
timbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while
advocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its
naturalness and expressiveness. Last, we propose the Takin Morphing system with
highly decoupled and advanced timbre and prosody modeling approaches, which
enables individuals to customize speech production with their preferred timbre
and prosody in a precise and controllable manner. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness and robustness of our Takin AudioLLM series models.

| GRIN: GRadient-INformed MoE | Liyuan Liu, Young Jin Kim, Shuohang Wang, Chen Liang, Yelong Shen, Hao Cheng, Xiaodong Liu, Masahiro Tanaka, Xiaoxia Wu, Wenxiang Hu, Vishrav Chaudhary, Zeqi Lin, Chenruidong Zhang, Jilong Xue, Hany Awadalla, Jianfeng Gao, Weizhu Chen |   Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale more effectively than dense models due
to sparse computation through expert routing, selectively activating only a
small subset of expert modules. However, sparse computation challenges
traditional training practices, as discrete expert routing hinders standard
backpropagation and thus gradient-based optimization, which are the cornerstone
of deep learning. To better pursue the scaling power of MoE, we introduce GRIN
(GRadient-INformed MoE training), which incorporates sparse gradient estimation
for expert routing and configures model parallelism to avoid token dropping.
Applying GRIN to autoregressive language modeling, we develop a top-2
16$\times$3.8B MoE model. Our model, with only 6.6B activated parameters,
outperforms a 7B dense model and matches the performance of a 14B dense model
trained on the same data. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks
demonstrate the potential of GRIN to significantly enhance MoE efficacy,
achieving 79.4 on MMLU, 83.7 on HellaSwag, 74.4 on HumanEval, and 58.9 on MATH.

| BERT-VBD: Vietnamese Multi-Document Summarization Framework | Tuan-Cuong Vuong, Trang Mai Xuan, Thien Van Luong |   In tackling the challenge of Multi-Document Summarization (MDS), numerous
methods have been proposed, spanning both extractive and abstractive
summarization techniques. However, each approach has its own limitations,
making it less effective to rely solely on either one. An emerging and
promising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractive
summarization methods. Despite the plethora of studies in this domain, research
on the combined methodology remains scarce, particularly in the context of
Vietnamese language processing. This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDS
framework leveraging a two-component pipeline architecture that integrates
extractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs an
extractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This is
achieved by a modification of the pre-trained BERT network, which derives
semantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet network
structures. The second component utilizes the VBD-LLaMA2-7B-50b model for
abstractive summarization, ultimately generating the final summary document.
Our proposed framework demonstrates a positive performance, attaining ROUGE-2
scores of 39.6% on the VN-MDS dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art
baselines.

| Einstein-dilaton-four-Maxwell Holographic Anisotropic Models | Irina Ya. Aref'eva, Kristina Rannu, Pavel Slepov |   In recent literature on holographic QCD, the consideration of the
five-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell models has played a crucial role.
Typically, one Maxwell field is associated with the chemical potential, while
additional Maxwell fields are used to describe the anisotropy of the model. A
more general scenario involves up to four Maxwell fields. The second field
represents spatial longitudinal-transverse anisotropy, while the third and
fourth fields describe anisotropy induced by an external magnetic field. We
consider an ansatz for the metric characterized by four functions at zero
temperature and five functions at non-zero temperature. Maxwell field related
to the chemical potential is treated with the electric ansatz, as is customary,
whereas the remaining three Maxwell fields are treated with a magnetic ansatz.
We demonstrate that for the fully anisotropic diagonal metric only six out of
the seven equations are independent. One of the matter equations -- either the
dilaton or the vector potential equation -- follows from the Einstein equations
and the remaining matter equation. This redundancy arises due to the Bianchi
identity for the Einstein tensor and the specific form of the stress-energy
tensor in the model. A procedure for solving this system of six equations is
provided. This method generalizes previously studied cases involving up to
three Maxwell fields. In the solution with three magnetic fields our analysis
shows, that the dilaton equation is a consequence of the five Einstein
equations and the equation for the vector potential

| Bayesian estimation of the number of significant principal components
  for cultural data | Joshua C. Macdonald, Javier Blanco-Portillo, Marcus W. Feldman, Yoav Ram |   Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to analyze multivariate data
together with cluster analysis, which depends on the number of principal
components used. It is therefore important to determine the number of
significant principal components (PCs) extracted from a data set. Here we use a
variational Bayesian version of classical PCA, to develop a new method for
estimating the number of significant PCs in contexts where the number of
samples is of a similar to or greater than the number of features. This
eliminates guesswork and potential bias in manually determining the number of
principal components and avoids overestimation of variance by filtering noise.
This framework can be applied to datasets of different shapes (number of rows
and columns), different data types (binary, ordinal, categorical, continuous),
and with noisy and missing data. Therefore, it is especially useful for data
with arbitrary encodings and similar numbers of rows and columns, such as
cultural, ecological, morphological, and behavioral datasets. We tested our
method on both synthetic data and empirical datasets and found that it may
underestimate but not overestimate the number of principal components for the
synthetic data. A small number of components was found for each empirical
dataset. These results suggest that it is broadly applicable across the life
sciences.

| Linguini: A benchmark for language-agnostic linguistic reasoning | Eduardo Sánchez, Belen Alastruey, Christophe Ropers, Pontus Stenetorp, Mikel Artetxe, Marta R. Costa-jussà |   We propose a new benchmark to measure a language model's linguistic reasoning
skills without relying on pre-existing language-specific knowledge. The test
covers 894 questions grouped in 160 problems across 75 (mostly) extremely
low-resource languages, extracted from the International Linguistic Olympiad
corpus. To attain high accuracy on this benchmark, models don't need previous
knowledge of the tested language, as all the information needed to solve the
linguistic puzzle is presented in the context. We find that, while all analyzed
models rank below 25% accuracy, there is a significant gap between open and
closed models, with the best-performing proprietary model at 24.05% and the
best-performing open model at 8.84%.

| From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the
  primordial black hole reheating scenario | Guillem Domènech, Jan Tränkle |   We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs
originate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight
PBHs with masses $M\lesssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat
it via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate
whether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH
reheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the
initial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer
functions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and
isocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation
of state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH
dominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the
spectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive
to $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density
fluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance
as a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
observations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the
initial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we
find that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several
future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas,
especially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any
early matter-dominated universe scenario.

| Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules | Anqi Zhang, Wilson S. Geisler |   Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We
investigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented
displays having well-separated potential target-object locations. Performance
was compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption
that the information from the different potential target locations is
statistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than
optimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the
implausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show
that three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical
results. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near
optimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the
central potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise
causes search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These
findings have far-reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks
and other identification tasks in humans and other animals.

| Far-from-equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann
  approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows
  $v_n$ | Vincenzo Nugara, Vincenzo Greco, Salvatore Plumari |   We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal
system in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution
function and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system
sizes $R$ and interaction strength $\eta/s$ and identify universality classes
based upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each
of this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $\hat
\gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results
highlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum
moments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to
a 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of
different sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a
similar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse
flow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system
size and $\eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and
their response functions, along with the impact of the $\eta/s$ and the system
transverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in
momentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow
$v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of
large opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems
evolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play
in this process.

Qwen2.5-Math and Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct-1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the
Qwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self-improvement
throughout the entire pipeline, from pre-training and post-training to
inference: (1) During the pre-training phase, Qwen2-Math-Instruct is utilized
to generate large-scale, high-quality mathematical data. (2) In the
post-training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive
sampling from Qwen2-Math-Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative
evolution of data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model,
it's possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the
next round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the
ultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct.
(3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling,
optimizing the model's performance.
  Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced
mathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics
datasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and
AIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math
competition problems.

| Computing the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two-Dimensional
  Strongly-Correlated Systems | Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn |   We show that the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time-reversal
invariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary-condition
dependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non-interacting and
strongly-correlated insulators. By introducing a family of quasi-single
particle states associated to the many-body ground state of an insulator, we
show that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant can be expressed as the integral of a
certain Berry connection over half the space of boundary conditions, providing
an alternative expression to the formulations that appear in [Lee et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. $\textbf{100}$, 186807 (2008)]. We show the equivalence of the
different many-body formulations of the invariant, and show how they reduce to
known band-theoretic results for Slater determinant ground states. Finally, we
apply our results to analytically calculate the invariant for the Kane-Mele
model with nonlocal (orbital) Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) interactions. This
rigorously establishes the topological nontriviality of the Kane-Mele model
with HK interactions, and represents one of the few exact calculations of the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a strongly-interacting system.

| Weak Lensing analysis of Abell 2390 using short exposures | A. Dutta, J. R. Peterson, T. Rose, M. Cianfaglione, A. Bonafede, G. Li, G. Sembroski |   We present a weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 2390 at z =
0.23 using second moment shape measurements made in 411 short 60s exposures.
The exposures are obtained in three broadband photometric filters (g, r, i)
using WIYN-ODI. Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a
moment matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment matching
algorithm fails to converge at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The
measurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weight
to obtain accurate shape of sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim
simulations to validate shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find
the mass of Abell 2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We
also find the E-Mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic
structures and recovers most clusters/groups of galaxies found using Optical
and X-Ray data. Thus we demonstrate the feasibility of using Weak Lensing to
map large scale structure of the universe. We also find the central portion of
the cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the
peaks are similar to X-Ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster
and show that a late stage merger accounts for all the observed data.

| Low Frame-rate Speech Codec: a Codec Designed for Fast High-quality
  Speech LLM Training and Inference | Edresson Casanova, Ryan Langman, Paarth Neekhara, Shehzeen Hussain, Jason Li, Subhankar Ghosh, Ante Jukić, Sang-gil Lee |   Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing
through audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the
application of language modeling techniques to audio data. However, audio
codecs often operate at high frame rates, resulting in slow training and
inference, especially for autoregressive models. To address this challenge, we
present the Low Frame-rate Speech Codec (LFSC): a neural audio codec that
leverages finite scalar quantization and adversarial training with large speech
language models to achieve high-quality audio compression with a 1.89 kbps
bitrate and 21.5 frames per second. We demonstrate that our novel codec can
make the inference of LLM-based text-to-speech models around three times faster
while improving intelligibility and producing quality comparable to previous

| Stronger Baseline Models -- A Key Requirement for Aligning Machine
  Learning Research with Clinical Utility | Nathan Wolfrath, Joel Wolfrath, Hengrui Hu, Anjishnu Banerjee, Anai N. Kothari |   Machine Learning (ML) research has increased substantially in recent years,
due to the success of predictive modeling across diverse application domains.
However, well-known barriers exist when attempting to deploy ML models in
high-stakes, clinical settings, including lack of model transparency (or the
inability to audit the inference process), large training data requirements
with siloed data sources, and complicated metrics for measuring model utility.
In this work, we show empirically that including stronger baseline models in
healthcare ML evaluations has important downstream effects that aid
practitioners in addressing these challenges. Through a series of case studies,
we find that the common practice of omitting baselines or comparing against a
weak baseline model (e.g. a linear model with no optimization) obscures the
value of ML methods proposed in the research literature. Using these insights,
we propose some best practices that will enable practitioners to more
effectively study and deploy ML models in clinical settings.

| Revisiting Dark Photon Constraints from CMB Spectral Distortions | Jens Chluba, Bryce Cyr, Matthew C. Johnson |   Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide
stringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post-BBN (Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models
with COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers.
Here, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark
photon conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous
works only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the
change to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon
distortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the
distortion has an opposite sign and a $\simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We
furthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover
the redshift range $\simeq 2\times 10^6-4\times 10^7$ between the $\mu$-era and
the end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints
for dark photon masses in the range $10^{-4}\,{\rm eV}\lesssim m_{\rm
dp}\lesssim 10^{-3}\,{\rm eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We
demonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon
to dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $\mu$-type distortion
independent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study
dark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with
CMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.

| Bi-objective trail-planning for a robot team orienteering in a hazardous
  environment | Cory M. Simon, Jeffrey Richley, Lucas Overbey, Darleen Perez-Lavin |   Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in
resource delivery, patrolling, information-gathering, agriculture, forest fire
fighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and
search-and-rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments -- with e.g.
rough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or
capturing robots -- should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of
risks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should
take the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the
team-level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward
from visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider
bi-objective trail-planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a
hazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed
graph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of
survival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a
robot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for
the Pareto-optimal robot-team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team
objectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive
the mission. A human decision-maker can then select trail plans that balance,
according to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony
optimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto-optimal set of
robot team trail plans. As a case study, we illustrate with an
information-gathering mission in an art museum.

| Pareto Data Framework: Steps Towards Resource-Efficient Decision Making
  Using Minimum Viable Data (MVD) | Tashfain Ahmed, Josh Siegel |   This paper introduces the Pareto Data Framework, an approach for identifying
and selecting the Minimum Viable Data (MVD) required for enabling machine
learning applications on constrained platforms such as embedded systems, mobile
devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We demonstrate that strategic
data reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing
bandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies
Minimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource-constrained
environments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient
practices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and
overprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for
optimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data
representation. An experimental methodology demonstrates effective acoustic
data characterization after downsampling, quantization, and truncation to
simulate reduced-fidelity sensors and network and storage constraints; results
shows that performance can be maintained up to 95\% with sample rates reduced
by 75\% and bit depths and clip length reduced by 50\% which translates into
substantial cost and resource reduction. These findings have implications on
the design and development of constrained systems. The paper also discusses
broader implications of the framework, including the potential to democratize
advanced AI technologies across IoT applications and sectors such as
agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing to improve access and multiply
the benefits of data-driven insights.

(RS), there is an increasing demand for solutions that balance model accuracy
with computational efficiency. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a
powerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large,
complex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in
performance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and
its innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer
knowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact
and efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application
across various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and
historical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are
highlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational
efficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical
deployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of
KD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the
breadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case
studies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks,
such as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review
discusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical
constraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive
overview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS. Through this
organization, the paper not only elucidates the current state of research in KD
but also sets the stage for future research opportunities, thereby contributing
significantly to both academic research and real-world applications.

function properly. Given uncertainty about future growth rates and increasing
evidence that economic growth is a driver of social and environmental crises,
these growth dependencies pose serious societal challenges. In recent years,
more and more researchers have thus tried to identify growth-dependent systems
and develop policies to reduce their growth dependence. However, the concept of
'growth dependence' still lacks a consistent definition and operationalization,
which impedes more systematic empirical and theoretical research. This article
proposes a simple but powerful framework for defining and operationalizing the
concept of 'growth dependence' across socio-economic systems. We provide a
general definition consisting of four components that can be specified for
different empirical cases: (1) the system under investigation, (2) the unit of
measurement of growth, (3) the level of growth and (4) the relevant functions
or properties of the system under investigation. According to our general
definition, a socio-economic system is growth-dependent if it requires a
long-term positive growth rate in terms of a unit of economic measurement to
maintain all its functions or properties that are relevant within the chosen
normative framework. To illustrate the usefulness of our scheme, we apply it to
three areas at the heart of the existing literature on growth dependence:
employment, social insurance systems and public finance. These case studies
demonstrate that whether or not a system is growth-dependent hinges not only on
the empirical properties of the system itself but also on the specification of
the concept of growth dependence. Our framework enables coherent, robust and
effective definitions and research questions, fostering comparability of
findings across different cases and disciplines.

| SPRMamba: Surgical Phase Recognition for Endoscopic Submucosal
  Dissection with Mamba | Xiangning Zhang, Jinnan Chen, Qingwei Zhang, Chengfeng Zhou, Zhengjie Zhang, Xiaobo Li, Dahong Qian |   Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive procedure
initially designed for the treatment of early gastric cancer but is now widely
used for various gastrointestinal lesions. Computer-assisted Surgery systems
have played a crucial role in improving the precision and safety of ESD
procedures, however, their effectiveness is limited by the accurate recognition
of surgical phases. The intricate nature of ESD, with different lesion
characteristics and tissue structures, presents challenges for real-time
surgical phase recognition algorithms. Existing surgical phase recognition
algorithms struggle to efficiently capture temporal contexts in video-based
scenarios, leading to insufficient performance. To address these issues, we
propose SPRMamba, a novel Mamba-based framework for ESD surgical phase
recognition. SPRMamba leverages the strengths of Mamba for long-term temporal
modeling while introducing the Scaled Residual TranMamba block to enhance the
capture of fine-grained details, overcoming the limitations of traditional
temporal models like Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformers.
Moreover, a Temporal Sample Strategy is introduced to accelerate the
processing, which is essential for real-time phase recognition in clinical
settings. Extensive testing on the ESD385 dataset and the cholecystectomy
Cholec80 dataset demonstrates that SPRMamba surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits greater robustness across various surgical phase
recognition tasks.

| Measuring Human and AI Values based on Generative Psychometrics with
  Large Language Models | Haoran Ye, Yuhang Xie, Yuanyi Ren, Hanjun Fang, Xin Zhang, Guojie Song |   Human values and their measurement are long-standing interdisciplinary
inquiry. Recent advances in AI have sparked renewed interest in this area, with
large language models (LLMs) emerging as both tools and subjects of value
measurement. This work introduces Generative Psychometrics for Values (GPV), an
LLM-based, data-driven value measurement paradigm, theoretically grounded in
text-revealed selective perceptions. We begin by fine-tuning an LLM for
accurate perception-level value measurement and verifying the capability of
LLMs to parse texts into perceptions, forming the core of the GPV pipeline.
Applying GPV to human-authored blogs, we demonstrate its stability, validity,
and superiority over prior psychological tools. Then, extending GPV to LLM
value measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometric
methodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free-form
outputs, enabling context-specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis of

| FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated
  Long-Tailed Learning | Xiuhua Lu, Peng Li, Xuefeng Jiang |   Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy
in distributed machine learning. However, datasets distributed across each
client in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can
be globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly
affects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated
learning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it
fails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data.
This results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting
the equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a
methodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems,
we propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the
local training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred
optimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state-of-the-art
methods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed
distribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10-LT and
CIFAR-100-LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of
model performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long-tailed
distribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.

| Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error
  Detection | Zichang He, David Amaro, Ruslan Shaydulin, Marco Pistoia |   Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications. Doing
so requires overcoming the noise present on today's hardware. The quantum
approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling
up due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup
over state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems. However,
achieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require
fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant
implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection
code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the
algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with
up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we
propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance, and use it
to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance
to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our
model can be used to determine necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform
Goemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware. Our results demonstrate the
largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially
fault-tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date,
paving the way towards solving real-world applications with quantum computers.

| Cyclicity Analysis of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process | Vivek Kaushik |   In this thesis, we consider an $N$-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)
process satisfying the linear stochastic differential equation $d\mathbf x(t) =
- \mathbf B\mathbf x(t) dt + \boldsymbol \Sigma d \mathbf w(t).$ Here, $\mathbf
B$ is a fixed $N \times N$ circulant friction matrix whose eigenvalues have
positive real parts, $\boldsymbol \Sigma$ is a fixed $N \times M$ matrix. We
consider a signal propagation model governed by this OU process. In this model,
an underlying signal propagates throughout a network consisting of $N$ linked
sensors located in space. We interpret the $n$-th component of the OU process
as the measurement of the propagating effect made by the $n$-th sensor. The
matrix $\mathbf B$ represents the sensor network structure: if $\mathbf B$ has
first row $(b_1 \ , \ \dots \ , \ b_N),$ where $b_1>0$ and $b_2 \ , \ \dots \
,\ b_N \le 0,$ then the magnitude of $b_p$ quantifies how receptive the $n$-th
sensor is to activity within the $(n+p-1)$-th sensor. Finally, the $(m,n)$-th
entry of the matrix $\mathbf D = \frac{\boldsymbol \Sigma \boldsymbol
\Sigma^\text T}{2}$ is the covariance of the component noises injected into the
$m$-th and $n$-th sensors. For different choices of $\mathbf B$ and
$\boldsymbol \Sigma,$ we investigate whether Cyclicity Analysis enables us to
recover the structure of network. Roughly speaking, Cyclicity Analysis studies
the lead-lag dynamics pertaining to the components of a multivariate signal. We
specifically consider an $N \times N$ skew-symmetric matrix $\mathbf Q,$ known
as the lead matrix, in which the sign of its $(m,n)$-th entry captures the
lead-lag relationship between the $m$-th and $n$-th component OU processes. We
investigate whether the structure of the leading eigenvector of $\mathbf Q,$
the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of $\mathbf Q$ in
modulus, reflects the network structure induced by $\mathbf B.$

| Symmetry-Enriched Learning: A Category-Theoretic Framework for Robust
  Machine Learning Models | Ronald Katende |   This manuscript presents a novel framework that integrates higher-order
symmetries and category theory into machine learning. We introduce new
mathematical constructs, including hyper-symmetry categories and functorial
representations, to model complex transformations within learning algorithms.
Our contributions include the design of symmetry-enriched learning models, the
development of advanced optimization techniques leveraging categorical
symmetries, and the theoretical analysis of their implications for model
robustness, generalization, and convergence. Through rigorous proofs and
practical applications, we demonstrate that incorporating higher-dimensional
categorical structures enhances both the theoretical foundations and practical
capabilities of modern machine learning algorithms, opening new directions for

| Brain-Streams: fMRI-to-Image Reconstruction with Multi-modal Guidance | Jaehoon Joo, Taejin Jeong, Seongjae Hwang |   Understanding how humans process visual information is one of the crucial
steps for unraveling the underlying mechanism of brain activity. Recently, this
curiosity has motivated the fMRI-to-image reconstruction task; given the fMRI
data from visual stimuli, it aims to reconstruct the corresponding visual
stimuli. Surprisingly, leveraging powerful generative models such as the Latent
Diffusion Model (LDM) has shown promising results in reconstructing complex
visual stimuli such as high-resolution natural images from vision datasets.
Despite the impressive structural fidelity of these reconstructions, they often
lack details of small objects, ambiguous shapes, and semantic nuances.
Consequently, the incorporation of additional semantic knowledge, beyond mere
visuals, becomes imperative. In light of this, we exploit how modern LDMs
effectively incorporate multi-modal guidance (text guidance, visual guidance,
and image layout) for structurally and semantically plausible image
generations. Specifically, inspired by the two-streams hypothesis suggesting
that perceptual and semantic information are processed in different brain
regions, our framework, Brain-Streams, maps fMRI signals from these brain
regions to appropriate embeddings. That is, by extracting textual guidance from
semantic information regions and visual guidance from perceptual information
regions, Brain-Streams provides accurate multi-modal guidance to LDMs. We
validate the reconstruction ability of Brain-Streams both quantitatively and
qualitatively on a real fMRI dataset comprising natural image stimuli and fMRI
data.

| Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal
  execution and battery storage | Eduardo Abi Jaber, Nathan De Carvalho, Huyên Pham |   Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and
constraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity
markets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general
propagator model under linear functional inequality constraints. The optimal
control is given explicitly in terms of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers
and their conditional expectations, as a solution to a linear stochastic
Fredholm equation. We propose a stochastic version of the Uzawa algorithm on
the dual problem to construct the stochastic Lagrange multipliers numerically
via a stochastic projected gradient ascent, combined with a least-squares Monte
Carlo regression step to approximate their conditional expectations. We
illustrate our findings on two different practical applications with stochastic
signals: (i) an optimal execution problem with an exponential or a power law
decaying transient impact, with either a `no-shorting' constraint in the
presence of a `sell' signal, a `no-buying' constraint in the presence of a
`buy' signal or a stochastic `stop-trading' constraint whenever the exogenous
price drops below a specified reference level; (ii) a battery storage problem
with instantaneous operating costs, seasonal signals and fixed constraints on
both the charging power and the load capacity of the battery.

| Skill matching at scale: freelancer-project alignment for efficient
  multilingual candidate retrieval | Warren Jouanneau, Marc Palyart, Emma Jouffroy |   Finding the perfect match between a job proposal and a set of freelancers is
not an easy task to perform at scale, especially in multiple languages. In this
paper, we propose a novel neural retriever architecture that tackles this
problem in a multilingual setting. Our method encodes project descriptions and
freelancer profiles by leveraging pre-trained multilingual language models. The
latter are used as backbone for a custom transformer architecture that aims to
keep the structure of the profiles and project. This model is trained with a
contrastive loss on historical data. Thanks to several experiments, we show
that this approach effectively captures skill matching similarity and
facilitates efficient matching, outperforming traditional methods.

| An Efficient Projection-Based Next-best-view Planning Framework for
  Reconstruction of Unknown Objects | Zhizhou Jia, Shaohui Zhang, Qun Hao |   Efficiently and completely capturing the three-dimensional data of an object
is a fundamental problem in industrial and robotic applications. The task of
next-best-view (NBV) planning is to infer the pose of the next viewpoint based
on the current data, and gradually realize the complete three-dimensional
reconstruction. Many existing algorithms, however, suffer a large computational
burden due to the use of ray-casting. To address this, this paper proposes a
projection-based NBV planning framework. It can select the next best view at an
extremely fast speed while ensuring the complete scanning of the object.
Specifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into
ellipsoids based on the voxel structure.Then, the next best view is selected
from the candidate views using a projection-based viewpoint quality evaluation
function in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy. This process
replaces the ray-casting in voxel structures, significantly improving the
computational efficiency. Comparative experiments with other algorithms in a
simulation environment show that the framework proposed in this paper can
achieve 10 times efficiency improvement on the basis of capturing roughly the
same coverage. The real-world experimental results also prove the efficiency
and feasibility of the framework.

| Undersampling effects on observed periods of coronal oscillations | Daye Lim, Tom Van Doorsselaere, Valery M. Nakariakov, Dmitrii Y. Kolotkov, Yuhang Gao, David Berghmans |   Context. Recent observations of decayless transverse oscillations have shown
two branches in the relationship between periods and loop lengths. One is a
linear relationship, interpreted as a standing mode. The other shows almost no
correlation and has not yet been interpreted conclusively. Aims. We
investigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless
oscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely
follow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations
are standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations
where the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase
are randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal
by considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of
telescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast
Fourier transform. Results. When the sampling cadence is getting closer to the
actual oscillation period, a tendency for overestimating periods in short loops
is enhanced. The relationship between loop lengths and periods of the sampled
signals shows the two branches as in the observation. Conclusions. We find that
long periods of decayless oscillations occurring in short loops could be the
result of undersampling.

| Enwrapped Perylene Bisimide Enables Room Temperature Polariton Lasing
  and Photonic Lattices | Dominik Horneber, Johannes Düreth, Tim Schembri, Simon Betzold, Matthias Stolte, Sven Höfling, Frank Würthner, Sebastian Klembt |   Perylene bisimides (PBIs) are organic dyes with photoluminescence quantum
yields (PLQY) close to unity in solution and great thermal and photo-chemical
stability. These features alongside the tunability of their solid-state packing
arrangement via chemical functionalization make this material class an
excellent candidate for exciton-polariton lasing at room temperature. Polariton
lasing is well understood in III-V semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures,
however, the search for emitter materials for robust and versatile room
temperature applications is ongoing. While e.g. perovskites and several organic
materials have been identified to support polariton lasing, many of these
materials lack tunability and long-term stability under ambient conditions.
Here, we fabricate optical microcavities using a strongly enwrapped PBI
chromophore with prevailing monomer-like absorption and emission properties in
the solid state. Voluminous bay-substituents prevent stacking induced
PLQY-quenching, thereby enabling polariton lasing at room temperature.
Additionally, photonic confinement in single hemispheric resonators is
demonstrated leading to localized polaritonic modes with discrete energies, as
well as optical lattices revealing distinct polaritonic band-structures. Due to
the possibility of tunable properties by the precise control of the solid-state
packing arrangement of PBI emitters, our results pave the way for
polarization-dependent light-matter coupling, including topological photonic
effects within oriented crystalline thin-film microcavity structures.

| IMRL: Integrating Visual, Physical, Temporal, and Geometric
  Representations for Enhanced Food Acquisition | Rui Liu, Zahiruddin Mahammad, Amisha Bhaskar, Pratap Tokekar |   Robotic assistive feeding holds significant promise for improving the quality
of life for individuals with eating disabilities. However, acquiring diverse
food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents
unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric
information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g.,
color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially
when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance.
We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition.
Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy
based on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, such
representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse
acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which
integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance
the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach
captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular,
liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and
introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and
assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies
based on context, improving the robot's capability to handle diverse food
acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach's
robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations,
including zero-shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves
improvement up to $35\%$ in success rate compared with the best-performing
baseline.

| Uncovering liquid-substrate fluctuation effects on crystal growth and
  disordered hyperuniformity of two-dimensional materials | S. K. Mkhonta, Zhi-Feng Huang, K. R. Elder |   We investigate the growth of two-dimensional (2D) crystals on fluctuating
surfaces using a phase field crystal model that is relevant on atomic length
and diffusive time scales. Motivated by recent experiments which achieved
unprecedented fast growth of large-size high-quality 2D crystals on liquid
substrates, we uncover novel effects of liquid surfaces on microstructural
ordering. We find that substrate fluctuations generate short-ranged noise that
speeds up crystallization and grain growth of the overlayer, surpassing that of
free-standing system. Coupling to the liquid substrate fluctuations can also
modulate local randomness, leading to intriguing disordered structures with
hidden spatial order, i.e., disordered hyperuniformity. These results reveal
the physical mechanisms underlying the fast growth of 2D crystals on liquid
surfaces and demonstrate a novel strategy for synthesizing disordered
hyperuniform thin film structures.

| The Impact of Element Ordering on LM Agent Performance | Wayne Chi, Ameet Talwalkar, Chris Donahue |   There has been a surge of interest in language model agents that can navigate
virtual environments such as the web or desktop. To navigate such environments,
agents benefit from information on the various elements (e.g., buttons, text,
or images) present. It remains unclear which element attributes have the
greatest impact on agent performance, especially in environments that only
provide a graphical representation (i.e., pixels). Here we find that the
ordering in which elements are presented to the language model is surprisingly
impactful--randomizing element ordering in a webpage degrades agent performance
comparably to removing all visible text from an agent's state representation.
While a webpage provides a hierarchical ordering of elements, there is no such
ordering when parsing elements directly from pixels. Moreover, as tasks become
more challenging and models more sophisticated, our experiments suggest that
the impact of ordering increases. Finding an effective ordering is non-trivial.
We investigate the impact of various element ordering methods in web and
desktop environments. We find that dimensionality reduction provides a viable
ordering for pixel-only environments. We train a UI element detection model to
derive elements from pixels and apply our findings to an agent
benchmark--OmniACT--where we only have access to pixels. Our method completes
more than two times as many tasks on average relative to the previous
state-of-the-art.

| Quark saturation in the QCD phase diagram | Marcus Bluhm, Yuki Fujimoto, Larry McLerran, Marlene Nahrgang |   We determine the onset of Quarkyonic Matter corresponding to values of
temperature and baryon chemical potential at which the quark phase space
density becomes one. At zero temperature for baryon chemical potentials below
the mass of the Lambda baryon, only nucleons contribute to the quark density.
This is different at finite temperature, where all baryons, mesons and their
resonances can be excited and thus add quarks to the phase space. The
probability density to find a quark inside a hadron is determined using the
Yukawa ansatz of the IdylliQ model of Quarkyonic Matter. We estimate separately
the magnitude of the various contributions of nucleons, Delta baryons, pions as
well as further hadrons and resonances. The uncertainty in the parametrization
of the probability density to find a quark inside a nucleon is spanned by
assuming that at zero temperature the transition density to Quarkyonic Matter
is between one and three times that of nuclear matter. Various predictions for
a possible critical point associated with the chiral phase transition are found
close to a triple point at which the line of the deconfinement transition and
the curve associated with the transition to Quarkyonic Matter intersect. These
considerations provide an estimate for the region in the QCD phase diagram
where Quarkyonic Matter may be found.

in predicting ESRD progression, outperforming existing models in the
literature. We further apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to
enhance interpretability, providing insights into the impact of individual

We employ a set of CLS $N_f=2$ ensembles at three lattice spacings and various

  The global existence of weak solutions or classical solutions to the above

| ReLU Surrogates in Mixed-Integer MPC for Irrigation Scheduling | Bernard T. Agyeman, Jinfeng Liu, Sirish L. Shah |   Efficient water management in agriculture is important for mitigating the
growing freshwater scarcity crisis. Mixed-integer Model Predictive Control
(MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the complex
scheduling problems in agricultural irrigation. However, the computational
complexity of mixed-integer MPC still poses a significant challenge,
particularly in large-scale applications. This study proposes an approach to
enhance the computational efficiency of mixed-integer MPC-based irrigation
schedulers by employing ReLU surrogate models to describe the soil moisture
dynamics of the agricultural field. By leveraging the mixed-integer linear
representation of the ReLU operator, the proposed approach transforms the
mixed-integer MPC-based scheduler with a quadratic cost function into a
mixed-integer quadratic program, which is the simplest class of mixed-integer
nonlinear programming problems that can be efficiently solved using global
optimization solvers. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated
through comparative studies conducted on a large-scale agricultural field
across two growing seasons, involving other machine learning surrogate models,
specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and the widely used
triggered irrigation scheduling method. The ReLU-based approach significantly
reduces solution times -- by up to 99.5\% -- while achieving comparable
performance to the LSTM approach in terms of water savings and Irrigation Water
Use Efficiency (IWUE). Moreover, the ReLU-based approach maintains enhanced
performance in terms of total prescribed irrigation and IWUE compared to the
widely-used triggered irrigation scheduling method.

| Design of Ligand-Binding Proteins with Atomic Flow Matching | Junqi Liu, Shaoning Li, Chence Shi, Zhi Yang, Jian Tang |   Designing novel proteins that bind to small molecules is a long-standing
challenge in computational biology, with applications in developing catalysts,
biosensors, and more. Current computational methods rely on the assumption that
the binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible,
as conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon
binding. In this work, we formulate proteins and molecules as unified
biotokens, and present AtomFlow, a novel deep generative model under the
flow-matching framework for the design of ligand-binding proteins from the 2D
target molecular graph alone. Operating on representative atoms of biotokens,
AtomFlow captures the flexibility of ligands and generates ligand conformations
and protein backbone structures iteratively. We consider the multi-scale nature
of biotokens and demonstrate that AtomFlow can be effectively trained on a
subset of structures from the Protein Data Bank, by matching flow vector field
using an SE(3) equivariant structure prediction network. Experimental results
show that our method can generate high fidelity ligand-binding proteins and
achieve performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model RFDiffusionAA,
while not requiring bound ligand structures. As a general framework, AtomFlow
holds the potential to be applied to various biomolecule generation tasks in
the future.

| Denoising diffusion models for high-resolution microscopy image
  restoration | Pamela Osuna-Vargas, Maren H. Wehrheim, Lucas Zinz, Johanna Rahm, Ashwin Balakrishnan, Alexandra Kaminer, Mike Heilemann, Matthias Kaschube |   Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at
the nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological
organization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of
fluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses
remain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced
laser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and
increased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high-resolution
images by conditioning the model on low-resolution information. Additionally,
the probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images
that tend to further increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We show that our model
achieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously
best-performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly,
while any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but
not all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all
four data sets, suggesting high generalizability.

| Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Via Data Pruning | Andrea Napoli, Paul White |   The removal of carefully-selected examples from training data has recently
emerged as an effective way of improving the robustness of machine learning
models. However, the best way to select these examples remains an open
question. In this paper, we consider the problem from the perspective of
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). We propose AdaPrune, a method for UDA
whereby training examples are removed to attempt to align the training
distribution to that of the target data. By adopting the maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) as the criterion for alignment, the problem can be neatly
formulated and solved as an integer quadratic program. We evaluate our approach
on a real-world domain shift task of bioacoustic event detection. As a method
for UDA, we show that AdaPrune outperforms related techniques, and is
complementary to other UDA algorithms such as CORAL. Our analysis of the
relationship between the MMD and model accuracy, along with t-SNE plots,
validate the proposed method as a principled and well-founded way of performing
data pruning.

| The elastica sling | Alessandro Cazzolli, Francesco Dal Corso |   The nonlinear mechanics of a flexible elastic rod constrained at its edges by
a pair of sliding sleeves is analyzed. The planar equilibrium configurations of
this variable-length elastica are found to have shape defined only by the
inclination of the two constraints, while their distance is responsible only
for scaling the size. By extending the theoretical stability criterion
available for systems under isoperimetric constraints to the case of variable
domains, the existence of no more than one stable equilibrium solution is
revealed. The set of sliding sleeves' inclination pairs for which the stability
is lost are identified. Such critical conditions allow the indefinite ejection
of the flexible rod from the sliding sleeves, thus realizing an elastica sling.
Finally, the theoretical findings are validated by experiments on a physical
prototype. The present results lead to a novel actuation principle that may
find application as a mechanism in energy harvesting, wave mitigation devices,
and soft robotic locomotion.

| Online Refractive Camera Model Calibration in Visual Inertial Odometry | Mohit Singh, Kostas Alexis |   This paper presents a general refractive camera model and online
co-estimation of odometry and the refractive index of unknown media. This
enables operation in diverse and varying refractive fluids, given only the
camera calibration in air. The refractive index is estimated online as a state
variable of a monocular visual-inertial odometry framework in an iterative
formulation using the proposed camera model. The method was verified on data
collected using an underwater robot traversing inside a pool. The evaluations
demonstrate convergence to the ideal refractive index for water despite
significant perturbations in the initialization. Simultaneously, the approach
enables on-par visual-inertial odometry performance in refractive media without
prior knowledge of the refractive index or requirement of medium-specific

dislocations in the defected layer leads to out-of-plane deformations that in
turn cause deformations of neighboring layers. Quantitative predictions are
made for the defect free energy of the multilayer stacks as compared to a
defect-free system, which is shown to increase with the number of layers and
system size. Furthermore it is predicted that system defect energy saturates by
roughly ten sheets in the stack, indicating the range of defect influence
across the multilayer. Variations of stress field distribution and layer height
profiles in different layer of the stack are also quantitatively identified.

| PAD-FT: A Lightweight Defense for Backdoor Attacks via Data Purification
  and Fine-Tuning | Yukai Xu, Yujie Gu, Kouichi Sakurai |   Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks,
particularly as recent advancements have led to increasingly subtle
implantation, making the defense more challenging. Existing defense mechanisms
typically rely on an additional clean dataset as a standard reference and
involve retraining an auxiliary model or fine-tuning the entire victim model.
However, these approaches are often computationally expensive and not always
feasible in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and
lightweight defense mechanism, termed PAD-FT, that does not require an
additional clean dataset and fine-tunes only a very small part of the model to
disinfect the victim model. To achieve this, our approach first introduces a
simple data purification process to identify and select the most-likely clean
data from the poisoned training dataset. The self-purified clean dataset is
then used for activation clipping and fine-tuning only the last classification
layer of the victim model. By integrating data purification, activation
clipping, and classifier fine-tuning, our mechanism PAD-FT demonstrates
superior effectiveness across multiple backdoor attack methods and datasets, as
confirmed through extensive experimental evaluation.

| Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing
  data in Irish sagas | P. MacCarron |   For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts
in order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify
similarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the
significance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture
requires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and
often impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the
network of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that
the top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent
with central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has
been lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust
to a large random removal of edges.

| The repetition threshold for ternary rich words | James D. Currie, Lucas Mol, Jarkko Peltomäki |   In 2014, Vesti proposed the problem of determining the repetition threshold
for infinite rich words, i.e., for infinite words in which all factors of
length $n$ contain $n$ distinct nonempty palindromic factors. In 2020, Currie,
Mol, and Rampersad proved a conjecture of Baranwal and Shallit that the
repetition threshold for binary rich words is $2 + \sqrt{2}/2$. In this paper,
we prove a structure theorem for $16/7$-power-free ternary rich words. Using
the structure theorem, we deduce that the repetition threshold for ternary rich
words is $1 + 1/(3 - \mu) \approx 2.25876324$, where $\mu$ is the unique real
root of the polynomial $x^3 - 2x^2 - 1$.

| Fitting Multilevel Factor Models | Tetiana Parshakova, Trevor Hastie, Stephen Boyd |   We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance
given by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~\cite{parshakova2023factor}. We
develop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of
the observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and
maintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved
through a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive
definite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of an invertible PSD MLR matrix
is also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the
recursive Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of
the inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky
factorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities,
yielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement. This paper is
accompanied by an open-source package that implements the proposed methods.

| Drifts of the sub-stellar points of the TRAPPIST-1 planets | Revol Alexandre, Émeline Bolmont, Mariana Sastre, Gabriel Tobie, Anne-Sophie Libert, Mathilde Kervazo, Sergi Blanco-Cuaresma |   Accurate modeling of tidal interactions is crucial for interpreting recent
JWST observations of the thermal emissions of TRAPPIST-1~b and c and for
characterizing the surface conditions and potential habitability of the other
planets in the system. Indeed, the rotation state of the planets, driven by
tidal forces, significantly influences the heat redistribution regime. Due to
their proximity to their host star and the estimated age of the system, the
TRAPPIST-1 planets are commonly assumed to be in a synchronization state. In
this work, we present the recent implementation of the co-planar tidal torque
and forces equations within the formalism of Kaula in the N-body code
Posidonius. This enables us to explore the hypothesis of synchronization using
a tidal model well suited to rocky planets. We studied the rotational state of
each planet by taking into account their multi-layer internal structure
computed with the code Burnman. Simulations show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets
are not perfectly synchronized but oscillate around the synchronization state.
Planet-planet interactions lead to strong variations on the mean motion and
tides fail to keep the spin synchronized with respect to the mean motion. As a
result, the sub-stellar point of each planet experiences short oscillations and
long-timescale drifts that lead the planets to achieve a synodic day with
periods varying from $55$~years to $290$~years depending on the planet.

| Quantum Magic and Multi-Partite Entanglement in the Structure of Nuclei | Florian Brökemeier, S. Momme Hengstenberg, James W. T. Keeble, Caroline E. P. Robin, Federico Rocco, Martin J. Savage |   Motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem, we present a detailed study of the
quantum complexity of $p$-shell and $sd$-shell nuclei. Valence-space nuclear
shell-model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit
registers using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$-shell and 24
qubits for the $sd$-shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement
($n$-tangles) and magic (non-stabilizerness) are determined. While exact
evaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of
active nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex
nuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique
is introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed
nuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\sim 8$ for some
nuclei. Significant multi-nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$-shell,
dominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of
magic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on
the path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion.
These results indicate that quantum-computing resources will accelerate
precision simulations of such nuclei and beyond.

| Post-Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a
  massive, rotating object | Lorenzo Iorio |   The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the
general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring
components of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are
analytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level. To the Newtonian
order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as
well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation
in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the
primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first
to 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system
along an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred
close to the Sun's flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due
to the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of
microarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for
the post-Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)
spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of
the latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current
(formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would
bring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the
predicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not
changed by any of the post--Keplerian accelerations considered. The
calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any
alternative models of gravity as well.

| Generalized Robot Learning Framework | Jiahuan Yan, Zhouyang Hong, Yu Zhao, Yu Tian, Yunxin Liu, Travis Davies, Luhui Hu |   Imitation based robot learning has recently gained significant attention in
the robotics field due to its theoretical potential for transferability and
generalizability. However, it remains notoriously costly, both in terms of
hardware and data collection, and deploying it in real-world environments
demands meticulous setup of robots and precise experimental conditions. In this
paper, we present a low-cost robot learning framework that is both easily
reproducible and transferable to various robots and environments. We
demonstrate that deployable imitation learning can be successfully applied even
to industrial-grade robots, not just expensive collaborative robotic arms.
Furthermore, our results show that multi-task robot learning is achievable with
simple network architectures and fewer demonstrations than previously thought
necessary. As the current evaluating method is almost subjective when it comes
to real-world manipulation tasks, we propose Voting Positive Rate (VPR) - a
novel evaluation strategy that provides a more objective assessment of
performance. We conduct an extensive comparison of success rates across various
self-designed tasks to validate our approach. To foster collaboration and
support the robot learning community, we have open-sourced all relevant
datasets and model checkpoints, available at huggingface.co/ZhiChengAI.

| PARAPHRASUS : A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Paraphrase
  Detection Models | Andrianos Michail, Simon Clematide, Juri Opitz |   The task of determining whether two texts are paraphrases has long been a
challenge in NLP. However, the prevailing notion of paraphrase is often quite
simplistic, offering only a limited view of the vast spectrum of paraphrase
phenomena. Indeed, we find that evaluating models in a paraphrase dataset can
leave uncertainty about their true semantic understanding. To alleviate this,
we release paraphrasus, a benchmark designed for multi-dimensional assessment
of paraphrase detection models and finer model selection. We find that
paraphrase detection models under a fine-grained evaluation lens exhibit
trade-offs that cannot be captured through a single classification dataset.

| Dual-Layer Training and Decoding of Large Language Model with
  Simultaneously Thinking and Speaking | Ningyuan Xi, Xiaoyu Wang, Yetao Wu, Teng Chen, Qingqing Gu, Jinxian Qu, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong Chen, Luo Ji |   Large Language Model can reasonably understand and generate human expressions
but may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have
been several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but
most of them are not data-driven or training-based. In this paper, we are
motivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel
model architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts
and then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines
to annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt-response samples, then
add language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We
train the language model by the thoughts-augmented data and successfully let
the thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally
output more reasonable responses. Both qualitative examples and quantitative
results validate the effectiveness and performance of TaS. Our code is
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TadE.

framework and through experiments, explanations on the response of a neural

| Artemis: Efficient Commit-and-Prove SNARKs for zkML | Hidde Lycklama, Alexander Viand, Nikolay Avramov, Nicolas Küchler, Anwar Hithnawi |   The widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) in various critical
applications, from healthcare to autonomous systems, has raised significant
concerns about privacy, accountability, and trustworthiness. To address these
concerns, recent research has focused on developing zero-knowledge machine
learning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of
ML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have
substantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily
optimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the
substantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the
model and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new
Commit-and-Prove SNARK (CP-SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that
effectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML
pipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white-box use of the
underlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic
polynomial commitment and only makes black-box use of the proof system. As a
result, Artemis is compatible with state-of-the-art proof systems without
trusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP-SNARKs, evaluate
their performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial
improvements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover
costs and maintaining efficiency even for large-scale models. For example, for
the VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from
11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML
towards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and
complex ML models.

| MMP for Enriques pairs and singular Enriques varieties | Francesco Antonio Denisi, Ángel David Ríos Ortiz, Nikolaos Tsakanikas, Zhixin Xie |   We introduce and study the class of primitive Enriques varieties, whose
smooth members are Enriques manifolds. We provide several examples and we
demonstrate that this class is stable under the operations of the Minimal Model
Program (MMP). In particular, given an Enriques manifold $Y$ and an effective
$\mathbb{R}$-divisor $B_Y$ on $Y$ such that the pair $(Y,B_Y)$ is log
canonical, we prove that any $(K_Y+B_Y)$-MMP terminates with a minimal model
$(Y',B_{Y'})$ of $(Y,B_Y)$, where $Y'$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial primitive
Enriques variety with canonical singularities. Finally, we investigate the
asymptotic theory of Enriques manifolds.

| Numerical renormalization group calculations for magnetic impurity
  systems with spin-orbit coupling and crystal-field effects | Aitor Calvo-Fernández, María Blanco-Rey, Asier Eiguren |   Exploiting symmetries in the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method
significantly enhances performance by improving accuracy, increasing
computational speed, and optimizing memory efficiency. Published codes focus on
continuous rotations and unitary groups, which generally are not applicable to
systems with strong crystal-field effects. The PointGroupNRG code implements
symmetries related to discrete rotation groups, which are defined by the user
in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, together with particle conservation
and spin rotation symmetries. In this paper we present a new version of the
code that extends the available finite groups, previously limited to simply
reducible point groups, in a way that all point and double groups become
accessible. It also includes the full spin-orbital rotation group. Moreover, to
improve the code's flexibility for impurities with complex interactions, this
new version allows to choose between a standard Anderson Hamiltonian for the
impurity or, as another novel feature, an ionic model that requires only the
spectrum and the impurity Lehmann amplitudes.

| Quantum-like nonlinear interferometry with frequency-engineered
  classical light | Romain Dalidet, Anthony Martin, Grégory Sauder, Laurent Labonté, Sébastien Tanzilli |   Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic
entanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits. Nonlinear
optics has served as a workhorse for the generation of entangled photon pairs,
ensuring both energy and phase conservation, but at the cost of limited rate
and degraded signal-to-noise ratio compared to laser-based interferometry
approaches. We present a \"quantum-like\" nonlinear optical method that reaches
super-resolution in single-photon detection regime. This is achieved by
replacing photon-pairs by coherent states of light, mimicking quantum
properties through classical nonlinear optics processes. Our scheme utilizes
two high-brightness lasers. This results in a substantially greater
signal-to-noise ratio compared to its quantum counterpart. Such an approach
paves the way to significantly reduced acquisition times, providing a pathway
to explore signals across a broader range of bandwidth. The need to increase
the frequency bandwidth of the quantum sensor significantly motivates the
potential applications of this pathway.

| A Survey-Based Quantitative Analysis of Stress Factors and Their Impacts
  Among Cybersecurity Professionals | Sunil Arora, John D. Hastings |   This study investigates the prevalence and underlying causes of work-related
stress and burnout among cybersecurity professionals using a quantitative
survey approach guided by the Job Demands-Resources model. Analysis of
responses from 50 cybersecurity practitioners reveals an alarming reality: 44%
report experiencing severe work-related stress and burnout, while an additional
28% are uncertain about their condition. The demanding nature of cybersecurity
roles, unrealistic expectations, and unsupportive organizational cultures
emerge as primary factors fueling this crisis. Notably, 66% of respondents
perceive cybersecurity jobs as more stressful than other IT positions, with 84%
facing additional challenges due to the pandemic and recent high-profile
breaches. The study finds that most cybersecurity experts are reluctant to
report their struggles to management, perpetuating a cycle of silence and
neglect. To address this critical issue, the paper recommends that
organizations foster supportive work environments, implement mindfulness
programs, and address systemic challenges. By prioritizing the mental health of
cybersecurity professionals, organizations can cultivate a more resilient and
effective workforce to protect against an ever-evolving threat landscape.

| Handling Long-Term Safety and Uncertainty in Safe Reinforcement Learning | Jonas Günster, Puze Liu, Jan Peters, Davide Tateo |   Safety is one of the key issues preventing the deployment of reinforcement
learning techniques in real-world robots. While most approaches in the Safe
Reinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and
robot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them
in complex real-world settings. Instead, model-based approaches that
incorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning
framework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on
the real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot
dynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task-specific and hard
to obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to
compute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long-term safety
requirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe
exploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus
on ensuring long-term safety and handling of uncertainty. Our approach is
competitive or superior to state-of-the-art methods in final performance while
maintaining safer behavior during training.

| Quasiperiodic Floquet-Gibbs states in Rydberg atomic systems | Wilson S. Martins, Federico Carollo, Kay Brandner, Igor Lesanovsky |   Open systems that are weakly coupled to a thermal environment and driven by
fast, periodically oscillating fields are commonly assumed to approach an
equilibrium-like steady state with respect to a truncated Floquet-Magnus
Hamiltonian. Using a general argument based on Fermi's golden rule, we show
that such Floquet-Gibbs states emerge naturally in periodically modulated
Rydberg atomic systems, whose lab-frame Hamiltonian is a quasiperiodic function
of time. Our approach applies as long as the inherent Bohr frequencies of the
system, the modulation frequency and the frequency of the driving laser, which
is necessary to uphold high-lying Rydberg excitations, are well separated. To
corroborate our analytical results, we analyze a realistic model of up to five
interacting Rydberg atoms with periodically changing detuning. We demonstrate
numerically that the second-order Floquet-Gibbs state of this system is
essentially indistinguishable from the steady state of the corresponding
Redfield equation if the modulation and driving frequencies are sufficiently
large.

| Understanding the Effects of the Baidu-ULTR Logging Policy on Two-Tower
  Models | Morris de Haan, Philipp Hager |   Despite the popularity of the two-tower model for unbiased learning to rank
(ULTR) tasks, recent work suggests that it suffers from a major limitation that
could lead to its collapse in industry applications: the problem of logging
policy confounding. Several potential solutions have even been proposed;
however, the evaluation of these methods was mostly conducted using
semi-synthetic simulation experiments. This paper bridges the gap between
theory and practice by investigating the confounding problem on the largest
real-world dataset, Baidu-ULTR. Our main contributions are threefold: 1) we
show that the conditions for the confounding problem are given on Baidu-ULTR,
2) the confounding problem bears no significant effect on the two-tower model,
and 3) we point to a potential mismatch between expert annotations, the golden
standard in ULTR, and user click behavior.

a significant performance drop across various state-of-the-art ASR models when
tested in conversational settings. Furthermore, we observe a correlation
between Word Error Rate and the presence of speech disfluencies, highlighting
